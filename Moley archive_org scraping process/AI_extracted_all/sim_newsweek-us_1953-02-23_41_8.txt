# Proliferation

WITH a number of the points in James B. Conant's recent piece about the organization of Harvard University it would be easy to disagree. On one point, however, it seems that no one who has followed the trend of higher education could dissent. He disparages the "proliferation of departments" which has proceeded to a degree that seems almost sinful. One can agree that it is desirable to cut back this wild, broken branching in the university with a stable framework.

A Harvard dean told me a few years ago hardly anyone in the college official that a few years ago hardly anyone in the college could remember more than a handful of the departments. Now, even worse than Harvard, a teacher's college is likely to give 100 courses on method and another 100 on the content of the subject.

Last week I had occasion to ponder this proliferation I know it shown in the catalogues of universities where I teach. There are eight pages of descriptions of 55 courses on the half of one floor of three buildings. These courses are divided into six groups: Those courses in methodology, demography and organization, social classes, social and urban sociology, ethnic relations and community organization, and public opinion and communication. A number of these courses, twelve in number, taught by more than 100 professors and others.

Take, for example, the group of courses on public opinion. There are courses on "mass communications," "the study of public opinion," "changes in attitudes," "psychological study of groups, motives, and attitudes," "methodological aspects of anthropological research." As a mere practitioner in public life who has experienced all these decades, I confess that I never knew that so much had to be known about them, let alone be taught about them.

When a junior professor the other day offered for the first time a seminar for those who had him for the first time.

One of my oldest and dearest department of sociology and above was a modest professor I believe of only three or four more graduate courses of more than a dozen courses. One of my contemporaries was a man of dimensions the same and repudiation. In those days there was that equality that has been found out. Only has a university was wary of old when a university was where essentially everything taught in these courses can be found in books. Students with time to read them. Students, however, are apparently pressed of inactivity to read. In any event they manage. So they no longer get time to read, what with running from course to course.

There is more we learn about less and less. The atom of human knowledge has been split into countless fragments. Students get inflicted to know less and less of principles and structure. The student lives in the thick of thin things.
