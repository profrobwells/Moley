# Army Over Ideology
by Raymond Moley

THE quotation which follows is from an article in The Current, a fine reorganization of political events written by experts. For a sufficient reason, his name is withheld. "The 1953 reorganization of the Soviet regime and command of the armed forces beyond the apprehension of the Stalin it was useful to keep the army in its place. Now, Voroshilov becomes a President and the old labor President, Shvernik, is demoted. Zhukov, having been thus rebound, is in disgrace. The combination of Bulgaria, Marshal Zhukuov, Vasilyevski, and other marshals represents the strongest armed forces we ever had to deal with."

(1) Whatever the other changes—the absence of a new Communist theorist replacing the standard pattern of the apparatus emphasis on the state to the detriment of party doctrine—this change in popular meaning is not yet observable. There may be a return to the tight military requirements of tight power control.

(2) If this interpretation is anywhere near right, then Malenkov and the Soviet Union under Stalin was getting ready to embark on a more nearly normal—forgetting the past, these or that stopped, that domestic policy this aggressive policy would have been followed to an even greater degree. But Malenkov's assumption of power probably means the abandonment of this policy of political warfare being, although as a later that was based on an aggressive policy in various sectors.

The stress upon forces in the Soviet Union has been strengthened greatly, and this has not been lost upon the NATO powers. The fact that the Soviet Government no longer includes personnel very close for any length of time at least very strongly for political power, and that the Soviet leadership is taken over with the approval of Stalin. How scarcely would have happened.

The new disposition is that, contrary to exception, leadership is taken over by a man who is more than a Trotsky or a Stalin and the Red Army, and Communist ideology has taken them a while to adjust.

Above all, to confirm the plain fact that Fadell remarked, on air, but is a soldier is a man with a gun in his hands and that soldier even though he differs may often understand that.
