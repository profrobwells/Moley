# The Parties: Raymond Moley...
*Contributing editor Moley, whose PERSPECTIVE usually appears elsewhere in NEWSWEEK, reports on "the men who run the parties."*

The city of Bristol lives in the history of politics. In 1780 its mercantile group decided to defeat Edmund Burke, its representative in Parliament. It is not especially relevant to note that on the issues which created their opposition—namely, the American colonies and Ireland—Burke was proved to be magnificently correct. More relevant it is that in a speech he made before the election he said that, while the member owed much to his constituents, he must put the national interest over their selfish interests, and that only through strong national parties could freedom be sustained.

These two principles are definitely established in British politics. The member and the candidate look to the high command of the party rather than to their constituents for guidance on policy.

With these points in mind, I have sought on this visit to study the party in the constituencies. In my article last week, I noted my observations concerning the Prime Minister's home constituency of Warwick, Leamington, and Kenilworth, the big regional Conservative office in Birmingham, and the Conservative fight to win the marginal seat at Rugby. Next, I journeyed to the constituency of Chippenham, which stretches 25 miles from east to west and contains two or three fair-size towns and a most attractive countryside.

Electoral Lubrieant: The Conservative agent there is Brig. J.A. Mellsop who retired from the regular army after twenty years' service. He is responsible not strictly to the member from Chippenham, but to the head office of the party in London. During the campaign he has five or six paid employes, but most of his department heads and a great many workers are volunteers. Everything is governed by written orders from Mellsop. His area of operation comprises 99 voting districts, and he must create and energize a committee with a chairman and volunteer workers in each. These distribute and mail party literature, but their most important task is the canvass, the basic element in an election campaign. Workers carry with them lists of the qualified voters and after an interview register thereon the preference of the voter. Early in the campaign, those who will need to vote by mail are identified. If they are Conservative, it is the job of the agent to see that they file the necessary paper for a ballot. On election day the Mellsop organization must see to it that every Conservative in the constituency votes.

Mellsop must also schedule six or eight daily appearances of his candidate at designated spots and an equal number for the candidate's wife. The Chippenham member is Sir David Eccles, Minister of Education. The brigadier only has $2,400 to spend in the campaign.

In Bristol, I confined my attention to the Labor Party. The secretary of the borough Labor Party is W.J. Waring, who presides over six constituencies, four of which are safely Labor. He is secretary of the Bristol Trade Union Council. He is also an elected member of the Borough Council.

Miserable Wages: Compared with the average Conservative constituency headquarters, Labor suffers from stark poverty. Their offices are usually in dingy, inexpensive quarters. Their employes are few and poorly paid. At least 90 per cent of the money necessary to run the Labor Party comes from the unions. The sums collected from union members are miserably small. And the difficulty of recruiting party members outside the unions is shown by the fact that while 140,000 votes were cast here in 1951 for Labor candidates, there are only 8,000 additional party members. A constituency agent whose operation I witnessed gets only $25 a week. He is a skilled engineer and could, if he left his party work, earn twice that. Waring himself, a man of character, intelligence, and long experience, gets only $34 a week.

# ...In England

The most interesting talk I have had in England on this trip was with E.V. Rees, who is regional Labor agent for all of southwestern England, an area comprising 43 constituencies. At his office in Bristol I asked him to explain how, despite its great and obvious inferiority in efficiency, means, and personnel, it is possible for the Labor Party to do as well as it does.

Mass Appeal: Labor, he said in effect, does not need as much organization as the Conservatives. It relies on mass appeal. The Conservatives must appeal to individuals. From the beginning, he added, British workers in revolt against the intolerable conditions under which they lived and worked were driven to mass action and solidarity. He said that this could be seen on any election day in the mining districts of Wales, where groups of workers march together to the polls, singing as they go. Finally, he added, the motive power behind it all is the remembrance of hard days in the past and the mistakes of Tory governments between the wars.

I believe if I had asked him he would have added that nationalization and planning and all the rest of the jargon of the intellectuals mean little to the party workers. Moreover, money, security, and better living conditions mean much more.

What Rees had said was very much on my mind when on the next day I carried out my determination to see with my own eyes the home constituency of that scourge of Tories and right-wing Socialists, the redoubtable Aneurin Bevan. From Cardiff, across the Severn from Bristol, I drove up the famous coal-rich Rhondda Valley, over the barren mountain summits at the end, which was at the moment snow-covered, and down into another valley to Tredegar.

Cordial Images: There, in another damp and dingy office behind a workingmen's hall, is the office of Bevan's agent. I had a most cordial reception. There are no displays of Attlee's picture, nor indeed is there much evidence of official Labor Party literature. It is all Bevan—his printed utterances and his picture. All over that area, in all the valleys, are long lines of stone and brick miners' houses. Behind them are innumerable mines. And inhabiting this country, are tens of thousands of workers and their wives to whom Bevan is an inspired prophet.

It would be grossly inaccurate and unfair to say that the Conservatives are all head and Labor all heart. For Conservative policies probably will do more for the workers of England than those of Labor. Certainly the Conservatives know it.
