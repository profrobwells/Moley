This process of by-passing Congress  
stems from a deep-seated feeling by  
the bureaucratic elite that the public  
and its representatives are incapable  
of understanding the high ideals and  
fine thinking that prevail in interna-  
tional intercourse. Consider these no-  
table last words of the maestro of the  
elite, Dean Acheson, addressed to the  
Foreign Service Association a year  
ago: “Make no mistake, there is a real  
battle with Congress. There is a great  
lag in the education and information  
between: you who know the outside  
world and the great mass of the  
American people and _ their eiected

you who know the facts of life,” ete.

RIGHT PROSPECTS  
The drive of the state toward con-  
servatism is explained by an amazing  
growth in well-being. It is true that  
the present boom was_ probably  
initiated by great sums of Federal  
money flowing in for the great dams  
on the rivers, the aircraft industry,  
the atomic installations at Hanford,  
and the Navy Yard at Bremerton.  
But a growing population, a third of  
which has come in since the war, is  
enough in itself to generate a flourish-  
ing economy. Moreover, the imposi-  
tion of a high sales tax has relieved  
the financial difficulties of the state  
government. It would be foolish  
to predict the outcome of the  
Magnuson-Langlie contest, but it  
seems clear that the prospects for the  
Republican Party to pick up a much

which is a call for a change of Presi-  
dents and party control in Washington.  
These people regard that change as a  
supreme necessity. For unless there is  
such a change, the principles and the

was born amid high hopes.  
It was designed to strike :  
the shackles off the oppressed citizen  
and permit him to take over from the  
bosses and political machines. Democ-  
racy was to reign in selections as well  
as elections. In fact, enthusiasm rose  
so high that Woodrow Wilson proph-  
esied that there would probably never  
be another national convention after  
1912 and that primaries would prevail.

ems to embody a perfect democratic  
principle, it falls far short of democ-  
racy in practice. The basic purpose of  
a primary, however, is not to measure  
the general popularity of a candidate  
but to permit the members of his own  
party to express a choice.
