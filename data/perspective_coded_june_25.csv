"329","Political analysis\Promote GOP unity and cause","IN SEVERAL articles I have pointed out that the future of the Republican Party and of truly conservative principles lies with the younger generation. In the House of Representatives three or four dozen members whose ages range from 30 to 55 have shown a marked capacity to work together. This provides meaning and substance to the opposition. In the South, as well as elsewhere, official leaders in the Republican organizations show this accent on youth. Many thousands of young men and women have entered political life in various Young Republican organizations.

A few YR's, however, have created very serious problems for the Republican Party and its responsible leaders. This was garishly illustrated in the national Young Republican convention in San Francisco in June. The situation there was not, as some say, a struggle between the liberal and conservative ""wings"" of the GOP. Nor was it, as Governor Rockefeller has said, a manifestation of extremism. The confusion was too complex to be dismissed by superficial and uninformed generalities.

To get things into perspective, I have talked with several present and former YR leaders, some of whom were present in San Francisco. I have also consulted three Republican U.S. senators who have taken a sympathetic interest in the YR's.",30.73,"1963-08-12batch2_114_page0.txt",1963-08-12,1963

"421","Education","The growth of private schools will certainly be accelerated. The concept of the free public school as the cradle of democracy will suffer some shocks. These private schools will not necessarily be supported by taxpayers' money. They may be private in the complete sense of the word. But all over the nation in the past twenty years the relative attendance in private schools has abruptly risen. Between 1940 and 1956 nonpublic schools grew four times faster than public schools. Twenty-nine per cent of the additional children who sought admittance to the schools between those years went to nonpublic schools.

One of the major reasons for this shift was popular dissatisfaction with the kind of education that the public schools were offering. The South now has another reason, which will greatly accentuate this trend.

Front Royal, Warren County, Va., after a court order requiring the opening of its high school on an integrated basis, established a foundation which is supporting private classes. The plan is solidly backed by the community. Its adaptation to other situations as a workable solution, however, cannot be predicted this early.

as police commissioner in a

held office in the NRA and WPA in

From the debacle of the Administration's program in Congress there have emerged crystalline issues for the campaign in 1940. The avalanche of defeat that began with the denial of President Roosevelt's request for the repeal of the arms embargo was devastating. It was so devastating, in fact, that it seems to have jolted from the leader of the party statements he may well wish he hadn't made.

Not only in arguing for the defeated measures but in regretting their loss, Mr. Roosevelt made predictions that only foreign and domestic disaster will satisfy.  The President selected the familiar economic barometer—the condition of business—to express his regrets. Business, he announced, will be poorer because of the action of Congress. Businessmen will hesitate to make commitments not only because of the failure of his arms-embargo repeal, and its effect upon the international situation, but because of the failure of the spend-lend program.

These are clear forecasts. Mr. Roosevelt used none of the fire-escape phrases usually employed by statistical analysts.

He turned questioner. For once he wasn't telling Congress: he was asking Congress.

That this gives him an advantage far beyond that which, in the nature of things, adduces to a questioner at once appears. For it brings into the open the strongest side of the President. It has been keenly remarked that this much must forever be said of the New Deal—that it has almost always asked the right questions. Its answers, of course, have been something else again.

This is not said by way of carping. No President is expected to know all the answers. It's only when Presidents think they do that our system of government is apt to go a little haywire.

Anyhow, it's nice to be back where the Administration isn't trying to ask itself and answer itself without stopping to let Congress and the voters have a whack at the game.

There is much to admire in his five and a half years of public service—his honesty, his insistence upon efficiency, his resistance to the perfunctory kind of service mere politics would achieve and, above all, his indomitable courage. But it is hard to see why a man so intelligent as he should persist in giving authority to the popular confusion that identifies the possession of wealth with the exercise of corporate power. Again and again Secretary Ickes has voiced the half-truth that a given number of individuals, having legal possession of a given proportion of the national wealth, ipso facto control business enterprise in America. And the answer to that half-truth has been made so many times to Mr. Ickes and ignored so many times by Mr. Ickes that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the distortion is willful.

The answer is that ownership of wealth and the exercise of corporate power are two separate things, and the second is by no means an inevitable consequence of the first. To assume that it is, is to overlook the limitations and restrictions that public policy, business necessity and legal restraint impose upon directors of the American corporation.

The power of a corporation like the Westinghouse or the General Electric, to mention only two, is not located in the individual will of the members of their boards of directors.
