Some Grounds
for Hope
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It makes no sense to pretend
that the Polish problem and
Pravda's rumor do not create
a serious strain in United Nations
relations. The net effect
upon American morale is not
good. But since the business of
diplomacy in Europe has for
centuries proceeded by methods
of bluff and counterbluff, it may
be helpful to look at some of
the brighter spots in the picture.
First, the Soviet Union
hardly points to a separate
Russo-German peace. With Russian
armies close to or beyond
the borders of Russia, it may
look as if Russia had accomplished
her purpose in the war.
The very fact that it looks that
way makes this a favorable moment
for Russia to get as high
a price as possible from England
and America for further
fighting.
MORE TO DO
But the fact that it seems as
if Russia has nearly completed
her war does not make it true.
Russia has a good deal to do
before she can call this war successful.
Her reckoning with Germany
is not over. Russia has
made it clear that Germany
must pay dearly for the devastation
of Russia, and the price
she demands—enforced labor by
Germans in Russia—cannot be
enforced by her alone. Full Russian
indemnity can be had only
by a peace jointly enforced by
the United States, Great Britain
and Russia.
It scarcely occurred to people
at the time, but Stalin's toast
to American production was itself
a skillful diplomatic gesture
to inform Britain of the
warm feeling of Russia toward
the United States. He was seeking
good will from us in the
three-cornered negotiations
ahead.
POLAND'S PRICE?
Moreover, on the Polish side
there is more to the fuss than
a mere disagreement about the
Curzon Line. Poland may be
willing to give up Eastern Poland,
but she will want a price,
too. That price will involve certain
pieces of Germany essential
to the stability of Poland after
her eastern provinces are cut
away.
The new Poland, cut off at
the Curzon Line, should, in order
to provide economic stability,
include East Prussia and
the remaining German part of
Upper Silesia. This would make
of Poland a compact, economically
sound country.
But these western concessions
are matters which must be enforced
upon a defeated Germany,
not by Russia alone, but by the
United Nations.
In order to bring Great Britain
and the United States to
pledge this compensation to Poland,
the Polish government-in-
exile may be holding off on its
acceptance of the Curzon Line.
These speculations are offered
in order to suggest that in the
game of diplomacy the geometric
figure of argument is
never a straight line.
It is seldom ever as simple
as a triangle or a rectangle.
It is a many-sided figure whose
exact nature is never wholly
visible. Whatever its shape, it
is never what it seems.
