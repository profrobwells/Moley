'Equal Rights'
Causes Split
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Vice-President Wallace's in-
dorsement of the equal rights
amendment has revealed an ex-
ceedingly important difference
of opinion on the so-called lib-
eral front.
The A.F.L. moves forward
with a reiteration of its undying
opposition to the measure. The
Daily Worker ascribes the re-
vival of attention to this peren-
nial to "reactionary" interests.
These "interests," it says, want
to remove "all minimum wages,
hour restrictions and the other
protections from the working
standards of women." An obvi-
ous follow-up would be longer
hours, lower wages and poor
working standards for every-
body.
Yet, this proposed amendment
is no creation of "reactionaries."
The fact is that conservative
opinion about the proposal is
negative. Industrial manage-
ment has only the haziest knowl-
edge of it and, so far as can be
ascertained, doesn't care much
whether or not it passes. To
many of us, it is remembered
only as choice bone of contention
between two groups of women
away back at the time when
women got the vote.
TWO POINTS OF VIEW
One group saw the elevation
of the status of women as some-
thing to be attained by empha-
sizing the differences between
the working capacities and per-
sonal problems of men and wom-
en. The other group was intent
upon the points of similarity in
the social situation of the sexes.
Men were inclined to regard the
matter as an intra-women scrap
and to watch it with amused
neutrality. That, it seems to me,
is the proper mood for a true
conservative.
But Henry Wallace is a gal-
lant soul with time on his hands.
Any glove tossed among the
lions is worthy of a Vice-Presi-
dential dive. In this instance,
there are formidable lions or
lionesses down there. Mrs.
Roosevelt and Madame Perkins
are against the amendment. Ex-
tremely vocal feminists are for
it. For the first time on record
the First Lady and Vice-Presl-
dent Wallace are at odds.
WHY THE FERVOR?
Far be it for a mere journalist
to fathom the mystical origins of
Mr. Wallace's political hunches.
But it would seem to me that the
wagon to which Mr. Wallace
would hitch his star is not of
his year of 1944. In the last
month he has taken on as op-
ponents industrial management,
farm leaders, the railroads and,
now, the embattled leaders of
labor and potent women's
groups.
Perhaps there are those
around Wallace who believe that
1944 is a Republican year and
that after a term under a Re-
publican President the New Deal
will come back pinker and more
irile than ever. Or, what is
more likely to be true, Mr. Wal-
lace conceives it as his duty to
be educational, to assume a sort
of roving professorship of uni-
versal knowledge. This espousal
of the equal rights amendment
seems to point to some such non-
political explanation.
