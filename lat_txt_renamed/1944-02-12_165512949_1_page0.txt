Naming Nazi
Guilty Urged
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Germany surrenders
and the United Nations get down
to keeping their pledge to punish
the individuals who started
the war and who, later, violated
the laws of war, who will be
placed on trial?
There are two reasons why
this should be determined soon.
First, because if we leave the
identity of the "war guilty" in
the fog until the armistice, we
shall probably never do much
about them. The other reason
has to do with winning the war.
If has to do with what our erudite
O.W.I. calls "psychological
warfare," which, as recently conducted
by the overseas O.W.I.
might more properly be called
"farcical warfare."
NAMING URGED
It makes no sense to expect
Germany to fall apart internally
if we leave the impression
that all 80,000,000 people are
equally guilty. That impression
will make a united Germany
fighting to the last ditch, and
in that ditch will be many a
United Nations soldier whose
life might be spared if we find
a way to discriminate among
Germans for their guilt in this
war.
If the specific classes of guilty
people are named now and revealed
to all Germans by a carefully
directed propaganda warfare,
a wedge will be driven between
the mass of a war-weary
people and the minority, who
will be singled out. Goebbels
will find it harder to convince
the mass of Germans that all
are to suffer equally, especially
if Goebbels himself, along with
his henchmen are pointed out
as prospective first-line victims.
Just what people are more
guilty than others, and how can
they be identified?
LIST SUGGESTED
First, there are the members
of the Nazi party up to the victorious
Hitler election in 1932.
These people were voluntary
members of a criminal conspiracy
whose professed purpose
was persecution, murder, theft
and war.
After Hitler became Chancellor
the voluntary character of
party membership was blurred
out. But other gangs appeared
whose members can also be
identified and who, in any court
could not plead lack of personal
responsibility. Most important
of these is the so-called S.S
which stands for Schutzstaffel.
This body, as well as the Gestapo,
is under the infamous
Himmler. Then there is the S.S
bodyguard, a personal Hitler
machine consisting of men
trusted by him, whose employment
was guaranteed for 25
years.
The so-called S.A., which
means Sports Abteilung, was
at first Hitler's private army. Its
leader was Roehm.
Beyond this are scores of
other official individuals who
later became willing accomplices.
Finally, there are those
members of the military whose
brutality in war was far beyond
the line of duty.
To concentrate upon this end
would be real psychological warfare.
