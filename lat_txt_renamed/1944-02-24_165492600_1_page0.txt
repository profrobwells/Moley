Are We Going
to Be Poorer?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Whether we shall, as a nation,
be poorer or richer after this
war is a question that has been
troubling a good many Americans.
The British, too, have been
pondering a statement that
Lord Woolton made some weeks
ago. The noble lord said: "For
some years to come we shall be
a nation poor in wealth, though
we shall be rich beyond any
dream of the past in reputation."
A reputation, no doubt Lord
Woolton knows, is of economic
value only as it is translated
into earning power, and this
poses several interesting pieces
of speculation. For, despite
oceans of statistics, the whole
matter is speculative. Wealth,
like reputation, depends for its
value upon what you do with it.
NOT JUST FIGURES
We shall have, when peace
comes, a debt of more than
$300,000,000,000. And in 1938 our
estimated national wealth was
something like that figure. If
wealth could be determined by
putting these figures on opposite
sides of our account book,
they would cancel each other
and we should be worth nothing.
That is palpably absurd. This
absurdity shows how the answer
to the question of whether
we are to be richer or poorer
cannot be answered by the use
of unrelated figures.
For one thing, the debt has
a number of offsets, such as the
proportion of the certificates of
debt that are in the hands of
governments--Federal, State
and local--the stock piles, the
war factories, useful things like
the Alaska Highway, harbor and
terminal improvements, and so
on. All these offsets have been
figured by some at $150,000,
000,000.
THE FUTURE?
Against all this is the depletion
of resources, which again
is subject to speculation rather
than to statistical reckoning. It
is true that we are consuming
vast quantities of precious oil
and metal resources for the ir-
recoverable purpose of war.
And in the supplies of these
raw materials we have measurable
limits. But before we
can reckon, from an examination
of the figures, our relative
wealth before and after the war,
we must be able to determine
what our needs will be for these
raw materials and for how long
in each case. Malaya, for example,
in a world dependent upon
natural rubber, would be very
rich. But in a world which can
make better and cheaper rubber
by synthetic processes, Malaya
would be poor.
Chemistry imposes a tremendous
question mark after every
estimate of the value of our raw
resources.
The basic fallacy of past reckonings
of national wealth lies
in their static character. They
are not capitalizations of possible
earnings. They are not
estimates of dynamic wealth.
And before they are put on
paper, change and progress render
them obsolete. In the next
column I shall endeavor to
point out the reasons why, on
the basis of a dynamic conception
of wealth, we may be
richer, rather than poorer, after
the war.
