The political and military im-
portance of getting Finland out
of the war is great. Perhaps that
is why Russia is willing to pay
a considerable price in future
guarantees of Finnish independ-
ence. At any rate, the elimina-
tion of Finland as a combatant
will certainly bring down in
ruins the whole German adven-
ture in Scandinavia.
Germany will be back, where
she was before the pretentious
and vicious attack upon Nor-
way almost four years ago. For
a glance at the map shows how
vulnerable the German grip or
Northern Norway would be-
once Russia was free to move
from Murmansk over the roof-
top of Europe toward the west.
There, for the time, Russian
land power and British sea
power would find the means of
real collaboration.
STRANGE MISSION
That the Nazis have seen this
for some time was revealed two
weeks ago in the news of a
strange mission by Rudolph
Christiani in Sweden.
Christiani is a highly respect-
ed Dane who, in spite of the
German occupation of his coun-
try, is still regarded as sufficient-
ly neutral to enable him to wield
considerable influence on both
sides of the war. He is head of
the Danish firm of Christiani
and Nielson, an engineering or-
ganization of world-wide note.
It has constructed bridges, parks
and similar installations all over
Europe and also in the Amer-
icas. It has large investments
wherever it has worked.
It was reliably reported in
Stockholm that Christiani had
proposed that if Germany were
willing to withdraw from Nor-
way and Denmark, Sweden
should take over those coun-
tries and neutralize them. The
Swedish Foreign Minister later
announced that he was not in-
terested in such a proposal.
That is where this idea rests
now.
NOT SO EASY
Germany, in her present
straits, would certainly have
gained great advantages from
such a withdrawal. It would
have made the German fortress
stronger on its northern side
and would have released German
divisions for action against the
Allies. And it would have spared
the Nazis the strain of main-
taining themselves in force over
the long stretch to the North
Cape.
But it would have isolated
Finland. That is the reason why
the proposal must have been
inspired by the Nazi belief that
Finland was as good as lost as
an ally. And that must mean
heavy withdrawals of German
forces from Finland have been
on the way for some time.
Withdrawal from Norway will
not be so easy. Three million
Norwegians hate the invaders
more than they fear death. The
first signs of withdrawal will
mean sabotage and assassina-
tion. If this is accelerated by
a Russian expedition into the
north and by Allied attacks on
the long coast, another Nazi dis-
aster may lie ahead.
