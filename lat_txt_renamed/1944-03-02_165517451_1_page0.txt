This Revolt Goes Far 'Back
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When we look beneath the
surface of the House vote over-
riding the President's veto of
the tax bill, a grim but inevi-
table conclusion emerges. Only
superficially is this tremendous
vote of no confidence the re-
suit of recent antagonism be-
tween the President and Con-
gress. It is the final fruit of a
mistaken Presidential policy
which has been under way since
1936. That policy, deliberately
adopted by the President after
the first bloom of the early New
Deal successes had faded, should
be called the second New Deal.
It consisted in pressing for
legislation affecting a minority
of the interests of the country.
To a certain extent it meant
shifting from emphasis on ben-
efiting the generality of the
country to benefits to specific
classes, chiefly in the great
cities. It left the so-called middle
groups in the rural districts and
small towns to shift for them-
selves and undertook a sort of
protectorate over the city bosses
and their large controlled vote
—over union labor, the unem-
ployed and the urban Negroes.
CLASS APPEALS
At about this time, the Pres-
ident's utterances became class
appeals. The one-third whom he
called "underprivileged" were
exalted and appealed to. Vast
sums were distributed in doles
and benefits. The city bosses
were smiled upon and, in turn,
they turned out colossal majori-
ties for the New Deal at the
polls. At this moment, however,
the rural districts and small
towns began to turn Republican.
In 1936, despite his majority of
11,000,000, the President actually
carried fewer counties than in
1932. That was the beginning of
the political revolution which
culminated in the overriding of
the tax veto.
In the House vote on the veto,
95 voted and seven were paired
in support of the veto. Of these
102 who supported the Presi-
dent, 67 represented city dis-
tricts. Five more represented
districts not in cities, but domi-
nated by union labor. Two were
by old-time Wisconsin Progres-
sives, and six came from moun-
tain districts in which govern-
ment largess is dominant. The
rest were from border States
and from Texas.
THE LAST STAND
The President had no votes
from the Southern States of Ar-
kansas, Mississippi, Alabama,
Florida, North and South Caro-
Jina and Maryland. He had only
one from Louisiana, one from
Georgia, and one from Virginia.
He had no votes from Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas
and Colorado. In Indiana he
had one vote—from Gary. In
Ohio he had three from Cleve-
land and one from Youngstown.
All his Illinois votes came from
Chicago, all his Michigan votes
from Detroit.
There was a good deal of irony
in the last stand of Tammany
and the boss-directed votes in
New York. Here was the Presi-
dent who, as a young man, car-
ried on a war against the bosses
in New York State. And yet,
only the Congressmen from boss-
ridden districts stood by the
erstwhile reformer in this crisis
of his career.
Jefferson warned the Demo-
cratic party against this dire
day. And so did a good many
moderns. But Mr. Roosevelt
knew better.
What has come of the Presi-
dent’s long insistence upon di-
viding the country between the
masses and the classes is that
he is finally left with only the
classes to whom he has ap-
pealed. Under a representative
republic, those groups cannot
control in Congress.
The real issue will come in
November, when it is to be seen
whether the majorities massed
in the districts from which the
President’s veto votes came can
overwhelm those cast in the ones
that voted against him.
