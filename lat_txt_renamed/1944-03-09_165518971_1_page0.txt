The Nazi Gold
in Argentina
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Revolutions such as have bro-
ken out in the Argentine and
Uruguay are not the product of
patriotic zeal or of official am-
bition. That sort of thing was
possible generations ago. It
wasn't in the modern manner.
Revolutions, like alien propa-
ganda, are paid for, and they
come high. People don't risk
their lives for chicken feed. And
they are paid not in local cur-
rency or paper dollars or bills
of exchange, but in gold.
We don't know just how the
money to stage demonstrations
in the Argentine got there. Per-
haps our government knows, but
the press doesn't. We can do
some surmising, however.
Since much of the Argentinian
and Uruguayan propaganda is
pro-Nazi, we may assume that
the only man in the world
ready to pay for such stuff is
Hitler. We know all about where
Hitler got his gold. He stole it
from France, Holland, Belgium
and Scandinavia. A competent
source estimates the amount of
his gold loot at about $1,000,-
000,000.
GOLD STILL USED
But how the gold got from
Hitler to his stooges in South
America is not so clear. No
doubt, while Hess was in Ger-
many, it was paid through him.
At that time the Nazis had as
Ambassador in the Argentine
one Ritter, whose record was
none too good. In the Argentine
he ran as expensive and nu-
merous a gang as has ever been
operated in one country by an-
other. His activities became so
extensive that he was well on
the way to the creation of a
whole political party. It got so
bad the Argentine government
brought about his recall. Since
Ritter, business has apparently
been done with a few influen-
tial Argentinians. Gold has been
used, and it must have got there
by some route.
Hitler's outlets to the outside
world are through a limited
number of neutrals. Except for
what may have been trans-
mitted by submarines, the gold
must have gone through them.
Such shipments before this war
were simple matters of com-
merce in which the carriers and
receivers might be private per-
sons. Even in former wars, gov-
ernment clearances were not al-
ways required. But in this war
every neutral government with-
in reach of Hitler must know
of all gold movements.
SOME SURMISES
That Sweden engaged in this
business is most unlikely. It
has a good deal of its own gold
supply in South America for
safekeeping. Its regulation of
shipments is most strict and
scrupulous. Switzerland likewise
operates through a well-managed
central bank system. It has
probably buried its own gold in
the Alps. Portugal is not thought
to be guilty.
That leaves Turkey and Spain,
and it is hard to absolve them
of blame.
In any event, the best way to
maintain order in South Amer-
ican neutral states is to close
the channels now used for the
payment of troublemakers, and
that is to cut off shipments at
the source.
