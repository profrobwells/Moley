The Italian
Navy Question
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We don't know clearly what
the equivalent of a third of the
Italian navy means in terms of
British and American ships, but
Russia apparently is to get some
sort of additional naval power.
Mr. Churchill was not very
clear, either, as to when and
how the Russian fleet reinforce-
ment is to be provided or whether
it is to operate north or south
that the whole matter has some
connection with the sharper
policy recently adopted by the
Allies toward Turkey.
To say that Russia is displeased
with Turkey is to under-
state the case. German ships
are at large in the Black Sea
and, while the Axis has contended
that they were assembled
in Rumanian ports, it may well
be that they passed through the
Dardanelles and the Bosporus.
CRITICAL MATTER
The destruction of those ships
is a matter of critical importance,
now that Russian armies
are nearing Rumania. Beyond
that there is the fact that a carrier
or two off the coast of Rumania
could blast the Ploesti oil
fields and destroy a third of
Hitler's oil supply. In any
event, it may have dawned
upon the masterminds of Anglo-
American strategy that Ploesti
is a thousand times more important
than Rome.
The hard Russian attitude
toward Turkey so far may well
be based on the belief that if
Allied ships are sent through
the Dardanelles, the Turkish
government would not dare resist.
It is up to Turkey now. It
may be that the reluctant drag-
on is approaching a crisis. Allah
is great and President Inonu is
a good prophet. But only as
long as he brings profits. Up to
now, he has been an exasper-
ating loss to Russia, Britain and
the United States. Obviously,
the tightening grasp of the
Allies upon Turkey will not
stop with the denial of free supplies.
A major action of the
war may be in store, in which
Turkey will provide a neutral
but unresisting avenue of attack.
WHY BROUGHT UP?
The dismal progress on the
road to Rome and the fact, now
apparent, that the original conception
of the Italian campaign
was faulty call for a fresh approach
to the "soft underbelly"
of the Axis. Our statesmen and
strategists, Roosevelt and
Churchill, are resourceful people,
even though they may not always
be right. If Turkey is not
the object of this talk about
ships for Russia, it is difficult to
see why the subject should have
been brought up at all.
This column, a few days ago,
mentioned revolutions in the
Argentine and Uruguay. The
inclusion of Uruguay was a regrettable
error in names. Uruguay,
it should be said in fairness,
has followed a course
sharply to be distinguished from
that of the Argentine. In fact,
it is depended upon by the
United Nations as a focal point
for Allied propaganda.
