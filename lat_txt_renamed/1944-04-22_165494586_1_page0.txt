Real Story of Wisconsin
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The following account of what
was behind Mr. Willkie's disas
ter in Wisconsin is based upon
the report of a highly informed
and politically sophisticated resi-
dent of that State whose story
seems to be supported by an
analysis of the final figures. It
now appears that Mr. Willkie
might have done much better if
there had been enough Demo-
cratic votes to save the President
and help Mr. Willkie, too. This
may well account for the bad
guessing of many of the journal-
ists who reported Mr. Willkie's
crusade.
This writer has no blueprint
of Mr. Willkie's reasons for
staking his all on the Badger
State. But it may be assumed
that he counted on thousands of
Democrats voting, under the
loose Wisconsin law, in the Re-
publican primary. This was a
reasonable assumption for him
to make, except for one fatal
oversight. There were not
enough Democratic votes to save
Mr. Roosevelt from an opposi-
tion ticket and to save Mr.
Willkie from Republican opposi-
tion. New Dealers may admire
Mr. Willkie but, after all, Mr.
Roosevelt is their first love, and
their meal ticket.
AT LAST MINUTE—
Everything looked promising
for a while. But as primary day
approached, it became evident
that the "Stop Politics—Win the
War" ticket headed by William
R. Callahan was making dis-
tinct progress against the Roose-
velt slate. Mr. Callahan himself
is frankly anti-Roosevelt, al-
though the movement which he
headed denied that it was "anti"
anything. But a victory for it
would have given the fourth
term a jolt of disastrous propor-
tions.
And so, a few days before the
primaries, Democrats who in-
tended to vote for Mr. Willkie
hastily altered their plans. A
last-minute scramble to put over
the Roosevelt slate took place.
And the day was saved for a
somewhat disheveled fourth-
term ticket.
One county, apparently, heard
nothing of the danger to the
President's ticket. And the re-
sults there show what might
have happened in the State had
the fourth-term supporters main-
tained a generous attitude to-
ward Mr. Willkie. In Dane
County, in which the city of
Madison is located, Mr. Callahan
received 5076 votes against 4624
for the high Roosevelt candidate,
Mr. McMurray. Mr. Willkie's
high man, Mr. Renk, received
7290, and Mr. Dewey's Mr. Zim-
merman, 4409.
'BAD NEWS'
Had this distribution of the
votes been the rule in the State,
it is possible to suggest that Mr.
Roosevelt, rather than Mr. Will-
kie, might have been thinking
about withdrawal after the pri-
mary. In any event, Mr. Willkie
would have remained in the race
for the nomination.
But there is plenty of warning
to Mr. Roosevelt in the final vote
in the State. The Callahan ticket
polled about 68,000 votes, the
Roosevelt ticket 97,000 votes.
If these figures are an indica-
tion of over-all sentiment, the
chances of Mr. Roosevelt in Wis-
consin are not bright. Of the
total vote in the State, the Demo-
crats received about 40 per cent.
And of these Democrats 37 per
cent were anti-fourth term. This
may not indicate what will hap-
pen in November, but it cer-
tainly is bad news for the sup-
porters of a fourth term.
