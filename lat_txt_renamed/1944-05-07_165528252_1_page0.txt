Mr. Biddle's
'Holy Writ'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Whatever credit can be given
to Attorney General Biddle as a
lawyer must be denied Mr. Bid
dle as a statesman. For when
he said the courts ought to yield
to the President in a case like
Ward's, he was creating the be
lief throughout the country that
an agent of the President was
putting his boss above the law
and the courts.
Mr. Biddle said, of course,
that the courts "ought" to yield
to the President, not that they
"must," and on the second day
of the court hearing he made
his original point all over again.
Yet such, is the inexactness of
those who read as they run, that
he somehow permitted a great
fear to permeate the country at
a moment when hope and con-
fidence are indispensable.
HIS METAPHYSICS
In answer to Ward's attorney,
Mr. Biddle said, according to
newspaper accounts: "I would
say, however, that the Presi-
dent has certain powers in an
emergency, and I do not think
most courts would like to dis-
pute or change a Presidential
order in time of emergency."
Mr. Biddle did not help the
public to understand things by
his indulgence in legal meta-
physics about a "great" consti-
tutional reserve of power" that
rises like a mist over the Pres-
idential office-a power that de-
rives from no specific laws, but
from the totality of authority
of the Executive. Then, in or-
der to make his meaning utterly
unclear, he averred that the
power he claimed for the Pres-
ident was to be found "in the
history of executive orders."
The latter suggestion is like
the claim of a driver who, pass-
ing a red light, explains that
his authority to do so derives
from his history as a driver.
Mr. Biddle's statesmanship de-
rives from a certain metaphysi-
cal turn characteristic of many
streamlined law schools in re-
cent years. In an effort to get
away from the dead hand of the
past, some of our legal teacher-
philosophers have blown up
cloudy abstractions which go
by such names as "social jus-
tice," "progress" or "liberal-
ism."
'SORT OF HOLY WRIT'
When these teacher-philoso-
phers or their disciples get into
office, these abstractions take
on the personality of the boss
in Washington. Hence his ac-
tions, opinions and caprice or
those of his administrative sub-
ordinates become a sort of holy
writ.
What seems to be forgotten
is that common folks in this
country still believe in written
laws and juries and courts. They
are confused by muddy talk of
a "reserve of power" and the
like.
They can understand a man's
being carried out of his office.
But they cannot quite see the
mystical totality behind the sol-
diers carrying Mr. Avery.
