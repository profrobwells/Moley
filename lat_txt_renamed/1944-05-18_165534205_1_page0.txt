The Outlook
for Ohio
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This is written after a two-
day political survey in Ohio. My
interest there was to appraise
the effects of the primaries in
that pivotal State on the coming
conventions and the fall elec-
tion. Since Gov. Bricker remains
the only active and avowed can-
didate for the Republican Pres-
idential nomination his future
role and the Republican pros-
pects in his State have a bear-
ing on the forthcoming national
campaign.
Despite the big Dewey lead,
Gov. Bricker is still in the race.
He is conducting a virile per-
sonal campaign through the
country. In the past few months
he has traveled thousands of
miles from coast to coast. He
intends to continue this until
the convention.
SOME FRIENDS GAINED
Bricker's activity is winning
many friends and some dele-
gates' votesâ€”how many, no one
in Columbus will try to predict.
It is noteworthy of the Gover-
nor's campaign that it is direct-
ed just as definitely at building
up his party as at furthering
his own interests. For he is
firmly convinced of the impor-
tance of building up the Repub-
lican party, as a party, in con-
trast to the Democratic party,
which now seems to consist
merely of one man and several
million anxious and expectant
followers. If by any chance the
President should announce that
he will not run before the Re-
publican convention meets,
Bricker would gain on Dewey.
There is some speculation
about the Republican Vice-Pres-
idential nomination in case Gov.
Dewey is nominated. Bricker
himself declares that he is not
interested in the Vice-Presiden-
cy and he is undoubtedly per-
fectly sincere. But some Ohio
people point out that to nomi-
nate the Ohio Governor would
greatly strengthen the ticket in
the Midwest and make more
certain the carrying of Ohio and
the States bordering on Ohio.
THE PROSPECTS
Ohio looks safely Republican,
but after last week's primary it
does not look as safe as it did
before.
Because the primaries have
shown that each of the parties
contains a fairly sizable block
of opposition, it is obvious that
Ohio's vote in the Presidential
election cannot be certain. If
any doubt as to the prospect of
Republican victory in Ohio and
neighboring States troubles the
delegates in Chicago next June
when they are selecting a Vice-
Presidential candidate, they will
see the advantage of Bricker's
name on the ticket. But only if
it is presented as a party duty
will Bricker agree to run in sec-
ond place. If the Central States
look secure, then Warren will
be drafted to carry California.
