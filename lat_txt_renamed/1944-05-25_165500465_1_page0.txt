The People
Who Strike
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Critical decisions which may
well determine the nature of
industrial relations, if not the
control of government, for years
to come are being made every
day through votes on strikes
and union organization cast by
people who have no permanent
interest in their jobs or in the
place where they work.
This situation, which grow
more and more serious, is not
unlike wartime prohibition
through which a great national
policy was determined while
millions of men were away fighting
for their country. For this
recent perversion of democracy,
the administration in power is
responsible. And what is more
important, it stands to gain
more power through its failure
to protect the interest of those
whom it has called into military
service.

FRIVOLOUS REASONS
Strikes are called through the
votes of employees, and effective
power for certain national
unions is gained through votes
to organize. In plant after plant
these votes are being carried by
young, inexperienced, and, in
fact, temporary employees.
These people are setting up precedents
and implied obligations
which will be well entrenched
when, in the readjustments
after the war, the temporary
people will be gone, and the old
tenants of the jobs will be
moved back.
Even officials of the N.W.L.B.
and others who are close to the
scene admit that workers who
are often of tender age, the
women and girls, the old men
and others who know they can
not stay in the industry can
be depended upon to vote heavily
in favor of strikes. It is also
admitted that their motives are
often frivolous and have nothing
to do with the real issues.
They want a few days to catch
up on shopping or to look for
better living quarters, or they
are tired or the victims of the
hysterical appeals of the leaders.

TWO TYPES
The same witnesses say that
among the leaders who are behind
the demands for strikes,
two types are evident. The first
are plain troublemakers; the
second, men who are ambitious
for official positions in the unions.
Many of them are young
men who have reached a shop
steward's position and want to
go on to salaried jobs.
Meanwhile, management, frozen
to its job, has been unable
to cope with a labor movement
intent upon making management
an impotent custodian of
plants in which the real power
has been assumed by national
labor organizations. The rights
of those with seniority, who are
fighting with the Army and
Navy, are thus usurped by the
substitutes in their jobs.
