Mental Effects
of Rome's Fall
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The capture of Rome will
have a number of important ef-
fects upon the course of the
war. Some of these are psycho-
logical, some strategic.
Since the German occupation
of Rome, the Nazis have been
able to issue commentaries on
the Pope's utterances not only
favorable to themselves, but be-
cause they alone could claim
to be on the inside, convincing
to German Catholics. That will,
of course, end with the fall of
Rome. Allied occupation will
enable the Pope to speak and
act more freely, and his states-
manship can be of the highest
value, as it was demonstrated
to have been during and after
the first World War when he
was Papal Nuncio in Germany.
CAN BE BLASTED
The capture will also provide
spectacular proof that German
defense lines, even when they
are established with formidable
natural advantages, can be blast-
ed by superior Allied mecha-
nized forces. Another advantage
will be that capture will bring
the Allies closer to the explo-
sive Balkans. The next line,
which experts say will run
from Pisa to Ravenna, is longer
than the Cassino line and more
difficult to defend. Allied air and
shipping would then be fairly
close to Tito's position in Yugo-
slavia. Beyond the Pisa-Raven-
na line is the Po line, twice as
long as the Cassino line. De-
struction of the Po line would
bring the Allies close to the
very frontier of Austria. If an
attack there were combined
with Russian advances from the
east, the whole Nazi position
in the Balkans would probably
fall, regardless of what happens
in the west.
The fall of Rome can also be
made to carry a mystical threat
to the German mind. Already
fear of Germany's responsive-
ness to appeals based upon a
vague dread of the supernatural
is revealing itself in Goebbels'
broadcasts. Recently a German
observatory announced the ap-
proach of a comet which will
be visible in all Germany. A
comet appeared, according to
well-known Germany 'history,
in the Thirty Years' War, and
Germans have believed since
then that comets are bad for
the fatherland. Goebbels, there-
fore, hastened to say that the
old rule does not apply this
year. Recently a rainbow was
seen around the sun in Bel-
grade. The German Propaganda
Ministry then assured the Yugo-
slavs that this was a normal
physical event, without any po-
litical or military importance
whatever.
NO IMAGINATION
If the fall of the Eternal City,
which will be more ominous to
millions of Germans than 100
comets and rainbows, could
be associated by the Allied
propagandists with the mysti-
cism to which the German mind
is susceptible, it might be
worth many battles. Unfortu-
nately, however, our propagan-
da seems to have little of the
force or imagination needed to
make effective use of such an
event.
