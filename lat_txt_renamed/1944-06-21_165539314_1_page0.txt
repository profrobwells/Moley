The Friends
of Dewey
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If Gov. Dewey is nominated,
a lot is going to be said for and
against the men who are his ad-
visers and coworkers. This col-
umn has already described some
of these who advise him on pub-
lic policies. On the side of or-
ganization politics, the name of
Edwin F. Jaeckle, New York
State Republican chairman, will
soon have national interest.
What sort of man is he, and
what are his relations with the
Governor?
Jaeckle will receive the raps
the political organizer usually
gets. Jim Farley went through
that kind of thing and came out
of it smiling. Jaeckle is not the
man to be equally so easily, but
he will be equally unruffled. He
has no apologies for his interest
in politics, for he believes in
party government.
ADMIRATION FOR DEWEY
He has been a successful law-
yer in Buffalo for 20 years, and
no one has suggested that he
must depend upon politics for a
living. He is exceedingly proud
of his long interest and activity
in Republican politics. He never
met Dewey until the party con-
vention at Saratoga Springs in
1938, when Dewey was nomi-
nated for Governor the first
time. Jaeckle's good showing
in that campaign established
him firmly as the head of the
Republican State Committee.
There has been little dissension
in the six years since.
He has a deep admiration for
Dewey, but he cannot be classed
as a political stepfather of the
Governor. Neither can he be
called a servitor of the young
man who has come so far in
public importance. Jaeckle says
he is for the party and Dewey
is good for the party. Dewey,
he says, has what the party
needs—courage, ability and the
capacity for hard work.
WHO WILL IT BE?
His relations with Dewey are
based on that point of view.
Neither issues orders to the
other. On occasion, they stand
toe to toe and argue out a diffi-
cult political angle. But such
incidents only leave each man
liking the other more than ever.
Jaeckle knows Dewey is not a
man who is either easily flat-
tered or intimidated, although
he can take stiff opposition as
long as it is backed by reason-
able evidence. People are going
to learn that about Dewey as
Jaeckle has a long time since.
Whether Jaeckle will be na-
tional chairman if Dewey is
nominated is not yet clear.
There are three other leading
political figures in New York,
all of whom have the confi-
dence of Jaeckle and Dewey.
They are Russell Sprague, na-
tional committeeman for New
York; Herbert Brownell, a law-
yer in New York City who was
Dewey’s campaign manager in
1942, and Paul Lockwood, the
Governor’s secretary.
One of these, possibly Mr.
Brownell, may be campaign
manager under a national chair-
man. Someone else may be na-
tional chairman, but it is a good
bet that Mr. Jaeckle will be, if
he wants the job. For Dewey
is loyal to his friends, and
Jaeckle is one of the best of
them.
