The Plight
of Finland
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Nothing in the sad music and
folklore of Finland is as tragic
as the fate its people seem to
have prepared for themselves.
While Russian armies are moving
relentlessly into their country,
they have at last received
sharp notice that their great
friend, the United States, is at
the end of its patience. The
Finnish Minister to the United
States, Hjalmar J. Procope, and
three of his aids have been ordered
to leave the country.
Thus, diplomatic relations with
Finland have been reduced to
a mere thread.
Procope is a man of attractive
personal qualities. His popularity
in this country was very great in
those few months in 1940 when
the first Finnish-Russian war was
on. But when Finland joined
Germany in the war against
Russia in 1940, the status of
Finland and that of Procope with
it began to deteriorate in
Washington.
MISSION AT AN END
After Pearl Harbor he was
restricted in his activities by our
government. He could neither
make public statement nor conduct
propaganda on behalf of the
Finnish nation. The refusal of
Finland to accept Russian terms
of peace a few weeks ago made
Procope's position still more
difficult, and the present order of
dismissal brings his mission here
to an end.
The ouster of Procope and his
aids is a keen reminder to Finland
of its great loss in forfeiting the
friendship of the United States.
For had the Finns made a real
effort to get out of the war, the
influence of this country might
have helped them regain their
position in European affairs.
The Russian terms were not
overly severe. They involved
minor territorial adjustments and
the payment of reparations in
goods that would amount to about
$30 a year for 10 years for each
person in Finland. This looks like
a very cheap price to pay for
getting out of war.
FOLLY OF REFUSAL
Finland's excuse for refusing
the Russian terms was the presence
of the German army in Finland,
which is said to amount to seven
or eight divisions. The Finns also
said Russia ultimately would destroy
their independence. But the folly
of their refusal is shown by what
is happening now. The Germans
are still there, and now the
Russians are there, too, a great
force. Finland will be occupied
and probably devastated by war
between the Germans and
Russians.
By a strange irony, the Finns
have just paid their regular installment
on their old war debt to us. But
the amount paid, $140,000, can
hardly make up to us what their
stubborn stand has cost us, for
every Russian soldier used in
fighting Finland deprives Russia
of a man to fight Germany. That
means a longer war and more
Americans killed.
