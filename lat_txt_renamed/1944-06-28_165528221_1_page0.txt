Tariff Battle
Called Best Story
of Convention
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
CHICAGO, June 27,—The
best story of this convention is
likely to be the seven days’ bat-
tle over the foreign trade plank
of the platform just adopted.
Roused by the prospects that
competition for foreign trade by
nations impoverished by the
wars will enter American mar-
kets, old guard Republicans
sought to write a ringing dec-
laration for protective tariffs.
This might have given the Democrats
a fine chance to say that
the G.O.P. intended to return to
the policy of extreme economic
isolation which, with the pres-
ent temper of the country and
its creditor position, would
have made many votes for the
fourth term.
Opposed by Landon
Opposed to this trend was
former candidate Alf M. Lan-
don who favors what he calls
a “liberalized” policy on the tar-
iff. But as chairman of the sub-
committee of the resolutions
committee on tariff policy he
found his colleagues ready for
an all-out retreat to the disas-
trous Republican position of
1932.
As a symbol of that past Lan-
don found on the subcommittee
former Sen. Grundy of Pennsyl-
vania. I suspect that most peo-
ple in the country think that
Mr. Grundy is not a real person
but something Mr. Roosevelt
thought up to scare people with
in fireside chats. For Mr. Roose-
velt mostly refused to mention
the tariff by name but used the
expression “Grundyism” to typ-
ify all that was rapacious and
reactionary in foreign trade
policies in the Hoover adminis-
tration.
But there is a Mr. Grundy
and he was for a while Senator
from Pennsylvania and he is
hale and hearty in his 80’s. I
know this because I have seen
him recently. And let me add
that he has not changed his
ideas on the tariff. For right or
wrong he is a man of stability
and conviction.
Landon Wins Fight
But Landon won his fight and
the result is an admirable for-
eign trade plank which has
emerged from days and nights
of argument and hundreds of
pages of drafts. In the platform
declaration on foreign trade
three points are made. First,
we have a tariff and we shall
have it for the protection of our
domestic market and our labor
standards in case, after the
shooting war, the other nations
attempt a tariff war. But we
shall attempt through “every
co-operative effort” to build with
the nations a firm economic
peace. The best way to build
that system of co-operation is
through the negotiation of re-
ciprocal bilateral trade agree-
ments to be ratified by Con-
gress. That is a sound and lib-
eral position.
The Democrats cannot quar-
rel with it because it is exactly
what the present administration
has been talking about, but
somewhat ineffectively perform-
ing. And Republicans can adopt
it because Messrs. Roosevelt
and Hull lifted their policy from
the Republican ideas of Pres-
ident McKinley and they admit
the imitation.
Recalls McKinley
A reading of this new plat-
form statement on foreign trade
carries me back a good many
years to a day in Buffalo when,
as a youngster of 15, I heard
President McKinley make his
last speech. That speech bears
rereading now, for it not only
anticipated the good neighbor
policy, but the idea of recipro-
cal trade, and back beyond that
Secretary of State Blaine, a
greatly underrated statesman,
had the vision that lighted the
way of McKinley and Hull.
Foreign policy of that sort is
not a partisan matter. It is a
nation’s creed. And this Repub-
lican convention through Alf
Landon’s efforts has put its
party once more in the bright
light of that long tradition.
