The Money
Muddle
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is probable that the New
Deal, at the monetary conference which has just begun at
Bretton Woods, N.H., will hand
on a silver (and maybe even on
a gold) plate to the Republicans
a first-rate campaign issue. For
there is every evidence that the
deliberations there will end
either in futility or in decisions
that the American people will
never approve.
The personnel selected by the
President indicates a desire to
keep international negotiation
in the hands of people who are
so subservient to him as to assure
agreement with his eccentric
ideas on money matters.
The two members who are not
officials are Miss Mabel New-
comer, a Vassar teacher of economics, whose chief labors have
been limited to the field of taxation, and Edward D. Brown,
president of the First National
Bank of Chicago.
THE ABSENT LIST
However competent and orthodox his views may be, Mr.
Brown will be completely out-
voted by a long list of officials
responsible primarily to the
President and Mr. Morgenthau.
Every sound and first-rate economist, excepting Mr. Brown, in
private employment in the
United States, either in the universities or in commercial work
is conspicuous by his absence.
A score of such possibilities
could be named.
England, on the other hand,
has sent a good representation
of the very best economic brains
in the kingdom. Robbins, Robertson, Ronald and Eady are important names in England.
Lord Keynes, brilliant but
dangerously unorthodox, is at
Bretton Woods, too, no doubt to
serve as a Pied Piper for the
New Dealers present. He has
always had more of a following
here than in his own country.
And most New Deal economists
have been dancing to his tune
for years.
TOO MUCH TO EXPECT
The conference could hardly
meet at a more inauspicious
time. Who can tell now how
and when the nations can fix a
stable relationship among their
unstable currencies? Can anyone
tell now what sort of international lending machinery will
be appropriate when shooting
stops?
If this conference should decide to lay down such principles
to be followed by each nation in
the months and years ahead as
the seeking of sound national
currencies at home, an attempt
to work toward a balanced
budget, the promotion of private
rather than government lending
in the international markets, it
might perform a useful purpose.
But no one expects our American delegation to do that. Its
general slant is toward the
theories now fashionable in
Washington for which Lord
Keynes has designed most of the
patterns.
