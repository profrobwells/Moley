The Bosses
Are Not Tired
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
CHICAGO, July 19â€”The key-
note address by Gov. Kerr made
it abundantly clear that the
"tired old men" argument is giv-
ing the Democrats a good deal of
concern.
But there is plenty of evidence
that there is a select number of
men around this convention who
are not at all tired. And some
of them are not very old. They
are the bosses, mostly from
cities, some from industrial
States. They are perennials.
"Age does not stale, nor custom
wither" their infinite resource-
fulness and foresight.
They were here before the
New Deal and they will be here
long after that novel adventure
is only a memory. Like virile
weeds of ideology planted and
watched by Mr. Roosevelt shows
signs of failing interest and vigor
by the gardener. As the Presi-
dent loses his watchfulness these
bosses gain in boldness and in-
fluence. At the moment they are
very, very much concerned
about the Vice-Presidency.
Bosses Don't Agree
Co-operating with these bosses
on most matters is a relatively
new form of bossism, the C.I.O.
and its Political Action Commit-
tee. But the two groups of
bosses, labor and the city ma-
chines, are not in agreement on
the Vice-Presidency. Messrs.
Hillman and Murray want Wal-
lace, the city bosses want Sen.
Truman. At least that is the line-
up as this is written.
The evolution of Sen. Truman
as a contender for the succession
came partly as the result of a
series of eliminations, partly as
the result of the bosses' recogni-
tion of the Senator's authentic
machine origins. For he is a
product of the Kansas City
sphere of influence. The bosses
assume that he will, if he suc-
ceeds to the Presidency, be able
to understand their language and
to give a decent hearing to their
many needs.
Wallace Gives Ideas
Mr. Wallace, on the other
hand, has made it clear that his
heart is given to the submerged
and needy, including the C.I.O.
Over and over, he has eloquent-
ly made clear that he sees in
Messrs. Hillman and Murray the
authentic custodians of pure
democracy. They want Wallace
and they want him badly. But
they are practical men and some-
thing may be worked out if it
becomes apparent that their can-
didate cannot make the grade.
The practical bent of Mr. Hill-
man was shown in his willing-
ness to talk things over with
Sen. Truman, no doubt to probe
the Senator's love for the objec-
tives of the C.I.O. What he
learned is not known.
The bosses were mostly against
Mr. Roosevelt in the 1932 con-
vention. Now they are for him
as the only means of helping
their local tickets and of making
more probable a slice of Federal
patronage. But their minds run
on the days when they will have
the run of things once more in
party matters. And it certainly
looks as if they felt that those
days are just around the corner.
