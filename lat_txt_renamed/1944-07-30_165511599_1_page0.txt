New Deal
and Peace
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Democrats, at their re-
cent convention, encountered
stiff opposition in the allotment
of newspaper space, because of
the mounting news of the disin-
tegration of Germany. Speeches,
no doubt prepared many days
ahead, claiming the indispensa-
bility of the President to the car-
rying on of war, were competing
for public attention with the in-
creasing sharp possibility that
there might not be much war
left by election.
The Commander-in-Chier argu-
ment suffered much deteriora-
tion, in consequence. If the war
in Europe should end, the wast-
ing away of this plan would be
almost complete, for it will not
be easy to sustain the proposi-
tion that Gen. MacArthur and
the admirals need Mr. Roosevelt
to help them defeat Japan.
SECOND STRING
That may well leave the Dem-
ocrats only the second string
upon which their orators sawed
away with considerable aban-
don, the indispensability of the
President in the making of
peace. This theme was embroi-
dered in Gov. Robert S. Kerr's
keynote. "What," he declaimed,
"would Churchill and Stalin and
the generalissimo think when
they learn that we looked on
them as just a group of 'tired old
men'?"
What a strange slip to be
made by a politician of Gov.
Kerr's experience! For he should
know that any American would
answer that he wouldn't give a
hang what those babies thought.
Partisanship is going pretty
far when an American speaker
calls Stalin "much revered,
world-respected, most experi-
enced and strongest" in one
breath, while in another he ex-
coriates former President
Hoover and the Governor of
New York.
Another equally objectionable
argument, widely used, is the
assertion that only Mr. Roose-
velt can be trusted at the peace
table because only he knows the
secret diplomatic history of this
war. That argument springs
from a perennial political notion
that what a public man learns in
the course of his official busi-
ness is personal or, at least
party property. It would call for
using the war for political ad-
vantage in a most contemptible
form. What Messrs. Roosevelt
and Hull know, their successors
should and no doubt will know.
AMERICAN DUTY
Such information is national
property, just as the White
House and the Washington Mon-
ument are. Mr. Hoover, as soon
as Mr. Roosevelt was elected,
invited Mr. Roosevelt to the
White House and laid before
him all he knew of foreign poli-
cy. President Hoover's Secre-
tary of State, Mr. Stimson, vis-
ited Mr. Roosevelt and gave him
a complete current history of
foreign relations. In the four
months preceding the inaugura-
tion, in 1933, every member of
the Hoover administration was
wholly co-operative in giving
the new administration all
necessary information.
