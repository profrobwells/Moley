Real Test
of Neutrality
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The liberation of the Swiss
frontier not only will offer sev-
eral incidental military, politi-
cal and economic advantages to
the Allies, but it reminds us
once more of the question
whether we shall be able to af-
ford, in the world to come, the
luxury of a neutral nation.
Switzerland has for centuries
been the great asylum among
nations. The poets have it that
its mountains nourished liberty.
Its liberty-loving people protect-
ed the fugitive oppressed of the
world. Maybe so, but I have
no way of proving such a ro-
mantic origin of liberty. The
thing that is clear is that Swiss
liberty could have been terminat-
ed many times in the past cou-
ple of centuries, but it always
seemed more advantageous to
Switzerland's neighbors to main-
tain her neutrality. Switzerland
was more useful to warring
neighbors as an asylum than
as a highway. She came near
being the high road to France
in 1940 when German armies
stood on her borders ready to
move. But the quick collapse of
France saved the Swiss once
more.
IDEA OF ASYLUM
The historical neutrality of
the Swiss has had much to do
with the development of the
legal idea of asylum. It is note-
worthy that the so-called right
of an individual to claim pro-
tection in a neutral state has
no standing in international
law. What happens is that a
neutral state, because it is sov-
ereign in its own territory, may,
if it wishes, receive and hold
fugitives and, also, money and
valuables. The thrifty Swiss, it
may be observed, turned many
an honest franc that way.
Free and powerful nations
have always been hesitant about
denying small nations the right
to offer asylum. For to do that,
even in the case of dangerous
enemy individuals, would bring
into question the long and hon-
orable record of nations in
shielding political fugitives.
Fresh in the memories of the
most of us is the story of how,
after hot threats to hang the
Kaiser, British statesmen
changed their minds after Wil-
liam escaped to Holland.
PRINCIPLE OF LAW
It is a principle behind Eng-
lish law that it is better to let
a guilty man escape than to vio-
late the law that protects the
innocent.
The proposition that must be
faced after this war is whether
Switzerland or Sweden or the
Argentine will be permitted to
shield the persons or property
of those who, in Germany, Ja-
pan or Italy, precipitated this
war or were responsible for
its barbarities, Can Hitler be
permitted to hide behind the
principle of asylum which came
into being in the past, to pro-
tect great heroes? Will Goering
be permitted to return to Swe-
den? (His asylum there was a
real one, with padded cells and
everything.)
