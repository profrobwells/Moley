The Lesson
of Al Smith
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The life of Al Smith is a vivid
reminder of a fact which pres-
ent-day reform governments do
not seem to grasp. His luminous
career in public office proved
that government can have hu-
mane objectives and still be op-
erated on efficient and sound
principles. Gov. Smith had a
great heart and a clear head.
He reminded us of something
else, too—that we are being
asked to forget that a man can
rise in America without the
gratuity of government. He
knew full employment from his
first job, at 13, until his death
at 70. He was fully employed
because he fully believed that
opportunity came from hard
work, self-education and an in-
tense belief in his country.
LESSON IN POLITICS
It may be added that Al Smith
lived a lesson in politics which
it is well to remember this year.
He loved his party. He served
it, and it served him. But when
he saw his party depart from
principles which he considered
beneficial to his country, he pub-
licly repudiated his party. He
was not made of the stuff that
some Democrats are revealing
this year—Democrats who pri-
vately deplore the fourth term
but publicly support it. Al
Smith’s private convictions be-
come public affirmations when
he considered the public in-
terest at stake. It takes great
courage in politics to “take a
walk,” as Al, himself, put it. The
jackals snap at your heels and
future party honors are forever
gone. But Al Smith had that
sort of courage.
It is a pity that while this
great man was stricken with
his last illness there should
have been revived a rumor
which was born some months
ago. That rumor was that Al
Smith planned in this campaign
to repudiate his repudiation of
Mr. Roosevelt and to make
speeches for the fourth term.
FITTING EPITAPH
In March, when that story
first appeared, I made it my
business to investigate it. My
belief that it was not true was
confirmed by other friends of
the former Governor. I would
not ask him, because I don’t
ask friends to confirm or deny
rumors about themselves.
I wrote and published in this
column a denial of the rumor.
Mr. Smith read the column and
wrote me a letter of satisfaction
and appreciation. That disposes
of that rumor.
Al Smith died in his convic-
tion that the New Deal was bad
for the nation and bad for the
Democratic party.
He once spoke of his great
predecessor in the Governor’s
office in Albany, Grover Cleve-
land, as “a great rock in a
weary land.” Nothing more fit-
ting could be conceived than
that characterization as an epi-
taph for Alfred E. Smith.
