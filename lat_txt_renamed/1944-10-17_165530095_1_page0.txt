Has It
Backfired?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Commander-in-Chief argu-
ment for a fourth term is not
going well. New Dealers are
using it less and less for the
simple reason that the public
has refused to accept it. It just
didn't make sense.
It was a bold venture in polit-
ical trickery, however, and was
intended to convey the idea that
the President was Commander-
in-Chief of all of us, rather than
of the Army and Navy alone.
The Constitution, of course, says
that "the President shall be Com-
mander-in-Chief of the Army and
Navy of the United States."
HOW IT WORKS OUT
When the Constitution was
written, no one hinted at the
interpretation that Mr. Roose-
velt has delicately implied. In
any case, there was little discus-
sion of the subject in the Con-
stitutional Convention in 1787;
and what there was concerned
the question whether the Presi-
dent could put on a uniform and
direct armies in the field. This
question was left open. Wash-
ington, as President, actually did
take the field for a month in the
Whisky Rebellion. But Wash-
ington was a real soldier in his
own right. Lincoln, during the
first two years of the Civil War,
occasionally prodded a reluctant
general with an order. His inter-
ferences, however, were not suc-
cessful, and, when he found
Grant, he gave him full power.
Wilson was a strict Constitu-
tionalist. He permitted March
and Pershing to do all the mas-
terminding. And at this mo-
ment it is quite clear that Mar-
shall and King are in charge, and
both the Army and Navy would
bitterly resent White House in-
terference.
The evidence about 1787 clear-
ly shows that there was a great
fear of military dictatorship.
Hence, it is a fair inference that
the President was given com-
mand over the generals in order
to make certain that the mili-
tary should always be under
civilian control. This very im-
portant protection falls to the
ground if the President assumes
a military title in his relations
with the civil population.
ARGUMENT FOR DEWEY?
The President's real function
is to provide a means of co-ordi-
nating diplomatic action with
military and naval action. That
was precisely the function of the
President in the events which
preceded Pearl Harbor, although
the facts available indicate that
the job of co-ordination was not
well done. His further function
is to co-ordinate the nation's in-
dustrial and agricultural facil-
ities with military needs. This,
too, has been badly handled.
For these and many other rea-
sons the Commander-in-Chief
argument may, before the cam-
paign is over, be an argument
for Dewey, rather than for his
opponent.

what to do next. It will have to
get farther away than that for
safety.
