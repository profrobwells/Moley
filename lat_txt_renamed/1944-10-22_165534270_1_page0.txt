Congress
and Dewey
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gov. Dewey's forthright
speech on foreign policy in New
York will clear away many of
the doubts that have troubled
some very sincere and intelli-
gent people in this campaign.
These people have attempted to
distinguish between a prefer-
ence for the President on for-
eign affairs and a complete lack
of confidence in New Deal do-
mestic policies.
There are some factors in our
future foreign policy which Gov.
Dewey could hardly be expected
to mention, although a consider-
ation of them ought to clear
away what remains of these
people's doubts. Gov. Dewey
could not be expected to answer
the question posed by Demo-
cratic Chairman Hannegan to
the effect that if Gov. Dewey is
elected, Sen. Hiram W. Johnson
would be chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee of the
Senate. The fact is that if Gov.
Dewey is elected, the Senate will
still be Democratic, and Sen.
Tom Connally will be chairman.
THE TRUTH
Republicans privately admit
this, but, in the nature of
things, they cannot repudiate
the many candidates who are
running against sitting Demo-
cratic Senators. But an inde-
pendent commentator can say
it, and it is true. As to the
great fear of Hamilton Fish in
the House Committee on For-
eign Affairs, let it be repeated
that Rep. Fish is no longer on
the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Rep. Charles A. Eaton of New
Jersey is the ranking Repub-
lican there. Mr. Eaton is a pro-
fessed internationalist.
The great bugaboo of another
1919 Senate fight if Dewey is
elected ignores several other
vital factors. The election of
Dewey would give him an un-
questioned mandate to enforce
his program upon Congress, re-
gardless of its party complex-
ion. It is always that way with
a new President. In 1919, Wood-
row Wilson was not a new Pres-
ident. He had no mandate.
And he became very ill and
physically incapable of transact-
ing public business.
THE DIFFERENCE
In 1945, if Mr. Roosevelt is
elected, he will have the same
incapacity to deal with Con-
gress that he has manifested
before in recent years. The rift
between Mr. Roosevelt and Con-
gress is deep and old. No re-
election can change that. Re-
election did not change it in
1940, and after 1936 the first
measure which he proposed, the
court plan, was defeated. The
dominating Senators in 1919
were isolationist. The strong
ones now, like Connally, Austin
and Vandenberg, are committed
to international co-operation.
1945 simply cannot repeat 1919.
Another factor of great im-
portance is that the domestic
policies to which the New Deal
is committed will always pre-
vent a real policy of interna-
tional co-operation. A nation
cannot pursue collectivism at
home and free economic inter-
course abroad. In this respect,
Gov. Dewey's commitments are
to a free economy at home and
abroad. President Roosevelt
cannot truthfully promise that.
