Old Trick
of Oratory
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Joseph H. Ball's sup-
port of President Roosevelt con-
firms a long course of events
among the Stassen people which
has perplexed observers of Min-
nesota politics. The State was
clearly Republican in the sum-
mer. It is not so pronounced now.
It may be that the shift, like
that of Mr. Ball, is due to deep
conviction. But in light of all
the facts, it is hard to see how
the President's statement of last
Saturday could be the basis of a
reputation of the Republican
ticket and of Mr. Dewey's pro-
nouncements on foreign policy.
It is an old trick in the Presi-
dent's oratory to incorporate a
statement into a long speech,
which is not intended for his
vast radio audience, but for some
special group or purpose.
CONDITIONAL STATEMENT
The President's speech on for-
eign policy was very long. It
was interspersed with ad libs
which seemed to amuse the audi-
ence, but which served to con-
fuse the radio listeners. After a
half-hour of this sort of thing,
the following sentence appeared:
"So to my simple mind, it is
clear that, if the world organi-
zation is to have any reality at
all, our American representative
must be endowed in advance by
the people themselves, by consti-
tutional means through their
representatives in Congress, with
authority to act."
It is a statement so hedged
with conditions that it is hard to
interpret. It does not indicate
how this power can be given to
our representative by constitu-
tional means.
The real nub of the matter is
whether this representative, if
he can be or is given this pow-
er, is to be a creature of the
President or a genuine choice of
both President and Congress. Is
this man, who is to hold the
scales of life or death, to be a
Harry Hopkins or a distin-
guished choice of both branches
of government? Mr. Dewey can,
without seeming to echo the
President, raise this question.
A BROKEN PLEDGE
Is this the sort of thing that
permits Mr. Ball to violate his
pledged word to the Republican
convention in June? He said
then, in withdrawing Mr. Stas-
sen's name:
"The job of our party now is to
mobilize every last ounce of its
strength and energy to win in
November. The future of our
nation, of these sons of ours
fighting all over the world, is at
stake in this election. One-man
government must be ended in
the United States of America.
Our Republican nominee, Gov.
Dewey, must win, and to
that all-important and vital task
the friends of Harold Stassen in
Minnesota and elsewhere will
give from now on everything
they have."
Either Mr. Ball was indulging
in campaign oratory in June or
he is doing so now.
