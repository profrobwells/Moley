This Klan
Business
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Senator Truman met
the press in Los Angeles, one of
the most prominent people pres-
ent was Hal Styles, Democratic
candidate for Congress in Hol-
lywood. Styles was assisted in
his primary campaign by the
P.A.C. and various Hollywood
luminaries. The result of the
purge which produced his nom-
ination was the defeat of a fine,
able, highly respected and use-
ful Democratic Congressman,
John M. Costello. Then, in Sep-
tember, four months later, a
bomb was exploded under
Styles
It was revealed that he had
been a member of the Ku Klux
Klan in Jamaica, N.Y. After
much panicky evasion, explana-
tion was given that he had ex-
posed the Klan in newspaper
articles after his period of
hooded service.
LONG LAG
Let us examine his statement.
He says he joined the Klan in
1926. He says he wrote his ex-
pose in 1930. This looks like a
long lag if he joined it for the
purpose of exposing it.
When, at the press conference,
Mr. Truman was asked whether
he indorsed this man who is
running on the Democratic tick-
et with him, he said: "I know
nothing about his Ku Klux Klan
or any other connection, but if
he is one of ours, I am for him."
In short the Truman mentality
recognizes two kinds of people
â€”the people who are "ours" and
the people who oppose him po-
litically. He is for the former,
against the latter. This is the
mentality of the man who may
stand in the shoes of Washing-
ton and Lincoln. The President
of the United States is supposed
to be "for" every American citi-
zen. He is the honored mag-
istrate of all the people.
MORE ATTENTION!
If, as Mr. Styles says, 15,000,
000 people were members of the
Klan, it would seem to be the
part of wisdom for all political
parties and appointing officials
to examine their candidates more
closely. Mr. Truman apparently
does not believe this is neces-
sary, for he could easily have de-
termined Styles' former connec-
tion by asking him. Instead, he
said he knew nothing about it.
It may be wise for voters to
exercise vigilance about their
candidates for all offices. For,
surely, Americans want no for-
mer Klansmen in office. The
Klan flourished in the twenties.
Possibly many young voters do
not know what a blot it was on
our history. It is well that the
Styles incident and Mr. Truman's
strange indorsement of Styles
have once more brought the
whole thing to our attention.
Just a Suggestion
San Diego Union
An explanatory note in the
atest Gallup poll says:
"Polling of members of the
armed forces by civilians is not
permitted."
Dr. Gallup is overlooking a
bet. Why doesn't he get some
of Dan Tobin's Teamsters Union
boys to do the polling?
