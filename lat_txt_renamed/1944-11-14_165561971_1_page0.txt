The Press
and Its Duty
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since Harold L. Ickes has al-
ready terminated a 24-hours'
truce on political arguments by
an attack on the press, he de-
serves an immediate answer. He
invites friendly attention to the
fact that in 1932, 40 per cent of
the press was for F.D.R; in
1936, 36 per cent; in 1940, 23
per cent, and in 1944, less than
18 per cent.
Very well, Mr. Ickes, let us
put some other figures beside
ours. In 1933, 572,001 people
were on the administration pay
roll; in 1936, 824,250; in 1940,
76,831; in 1944, something un-
der 3,000,000, or about F.D.R.'s
majority.
THINK IT OVER
If these figures are broken
down by States, it will probably
be shown, after all of them are
in, that the F.D.R. majorities in
some cases are about equal to
the number of Federal em-
ployees.
If, in this comparison, we con-
sider that in any politician's
look a single job is good for
two, three, four or more votes,
the evidence is overwhelming.
If to that we add Boss Kelly's
city jobs in Illinois, Boss
Hague's in New Jersey and the
Tammany associates in New
York, the case is a cinch. Then,
for good measure, add Hill-
man's workers, alone, paid for
full-time work, out of union
members' contributions.
Mr. Ickes rose to prominence
by fighting machine politics. He
has spent his sunset years as
a political beneficiary of ma-
chine politics. He has seen both
sides of the fence. He must
know that the pabulum which
goes through the mouth to the
stomach is vastly quicker in its
reactions on voters than the
pabulum which goes through
the eyes to the brain. That is
he is best for quick results.
NEVER LOSES A WAR'
Mr. Ickes forgets also the les-
sons learned in Chicago under
Mayor Thompson, in New York
under Mayor Hylan and in
many other cities where a man
openly defied the press and
after winning election after
election, went down to final de-
feat.
The press loses battles, but
it never loses a war.
The decline in F.D.R.'s major-
ity after 1936 provides the pic-
ture of a regime which is los-
ing its strength. The jobs have
been rising in number, while
the opposition has been getting
stronger. The press will not de-
sert its principles because
part of the public has rejected
its advice. The mortal men of
the New Deal are facing the
judgment of an ageless institu-
tion which ultimately will re-
cord the end of them all.
Aren't We All!
