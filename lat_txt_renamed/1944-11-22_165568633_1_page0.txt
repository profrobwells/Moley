Polls Serve
the Curious
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a letter, written the day
before election, Mr. Elmo Roper,
who won honors this year by
his nearly accurate prediction of
the popular vote, makes this
very frank statement: "I think
the prediction of elections is a
socially useless function." And
in what he says further, he clear-
ly implies that the usefulness of
polls in marketing research is
always endangered when the
pollsters take their delicate and
undeveloped machine into the
dangerous jungles of political
prediction. Mr. Roper deserves
high, credit for this statement.
He has posed a question which
for a long time has disturbed
thoughtful people.
We can all agree that the use
of polls in connection with mar-
keting and other business activi-
ties is sound and economically
justifiable. The determination
of public tastes and preferences
in the economic field provides
security for producers and their
employers and affords the pub-
lic a better chance to get exactly
what it needs or wants.
MERE SPECULATION
Besides, the use of private
polls can be helpful to parties
and candidates in conducting
campaigns. They learn by selec-
tive polls where they are weak
and where they are strong.
Speakers learn from polls the
effectiveness of their efforts and
so are able to bring to the public
information and arguments
beneficial to the candidate, what-
ever may be the benefit to the
public.
But it is becoming more and
more evident that the public in-
terest is not served by publicly
published election polls. That,
no doubt, is what Mr. Roper
means when he says that elec-
tion polls are socially useless.
They cater to public curiosity,
but they divert the public mind
from more serious business.
They divert people from a con-
sideration of what ought to hap-
pen into useless speculations as
to what is likely to happen.
It isn't the accuracy, but the
utility of polls that is the real
issue. For it is clear that as the
accuracy of the polls increases,
their adverse influence will also
increase. As they improve in
technique and as more and more
people come to believe that they
are accurate, they contribute to
the influence on the least desir-
able voters, at the expense of us
all, since these provide the
means by which those fickle
people, high and low, who care
more about winning than they
care about principle, can select
the correct band wagon. I realize
that there are those who claim
that there is no band-wagon vote.
BAND-WAGON VOTE
William A. Lydgate of the Gal-
lup organization says in his
book, "What America Thinks,"
that there is no considerable
"band-wagon" vote. This asser-
tion I simply do not believe. I
personally know too many
"band-wagon" people.
And I believe that when
pollsters assert that there is no
important band-wagon vote,
their opinion must be accepted
with great caution, because their
assertion on that point is ob-
viously loaded with self-interest.
For the "band-wagon" principle
in human life, which goes back
to the very beginning of things,
is exactly what election polls en-
courage. And if there be any
value in the principle that com-
mands a man willing to lose for
his convictions rather than win
against his convictions, the pub-
lication of polls is detrimental
to that principle. Idle curiosity
never saved a country or built
a useful institution.
With the exception noted
above, election polls serve no
interest except curiosity.
