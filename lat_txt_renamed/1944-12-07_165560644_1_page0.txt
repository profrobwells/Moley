Thunder
on the Left
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While it may be well to waste
no sympathy on Mr. Norman
Littell, summarily fired by the
President for insubordination,
the charges he makes are not
pleasant reading. Mr. Littell has,
in the course of his Washing-
ton residence, established a high
rating as a pillar of words,
which distinguished him even
among the most vocal New Deal-
ers there.
There is something fantastic
about his verbal productivity.
Asked recently by a correspond-
ent for a paragraph or two on
a subject of interest to his home
city, Mr. Littell obliged by con-
tinuously writing for consider-
able parts of two days.
LONG-TIME FIGHT
His grievances against the At-
torney General consume 25
pages. His speeches have ranged
over a wide variety of subjects,
about and aside from his pro-
fessional concern with land law.
He is positive, emphatic and ex-
treme in his views, which place
him far to the left among New
Dealers.
His rumpus with Mr. Biddle
has been going on for months,
and apparently only the grave
danger that both apprehended
lest Thomas E. Dewey be elect-
ed President kept them quiet
until now. It is said that Mr.
Biddle decided to get rid of Mr.
Littell some months ago, but
waited until November. But now
that the Dewey storm has
passed and the "moral climate"
has been restored, the open sea-
son for feuding is on again.
Mr. Littell no doubt has been
reading up on something that
happened when he was a little
schoolboy. An insubordinate
man named Gifford Pinchot was
fired by President Taft, but the
fagots that burned him burned
up an administration. That row
had to do with land, which was
Mr. Littell's specialty in the De-
partment of Justice. Maybe Mr.
Littell, having been a Rhodes
scholar, has learned of history's
habit of repeating itself.
NOT LIGHT MATTERS
But these are not light mat-
ters of which Mr. Littell speaks,
however light Mr. Littell him-
self may be. The legal profes-
sion might be reminded once
more of its failure to establish
a proper distinction between
matters which require the skill
a lawyer acquires in law school
and a variety of mundane mat-
ters which are not legal at all.
It needs once more to con-
sider means by which legal
services can be paid, at rates
which approximate fair compen-
sation for legal services per-
formed. Congress, too, should
once more face the perennial
problem of defining standards
of propriety for the relations be-
tween private lawyers and pub-
lic officials.
Never did the gaunt specter
of temptation stalk the streets
of Washington so freely as in
these days of billions, and never
has an administration been so
intrenched in a maze of per-
sonal friendships and mutual
obligations. There is plenty of
work for this Congress to do,
and plenty of light needs to be
shed on public business.
