The New
Appointees
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the President had appointed
six Benjamin Franklins to the
top jobs in the State Department
there would be screams from the
left wing to the effect that Poor
Richard was not poor at all, but
a penny-pinching capitalist. So
we must expect that no one will
be wholly pleased with Secretary
Stettinius’ sweeping changes in
his department. From this angle
the appointments look spotty—
some good, some very doubtful.
But one thing ought to be
made clear. The State Department
appointments cannot and
should not be made on the basis
of ideology. Whether this or
that Undersecretary or Assistant
Secretary is or is not a New Dealer
or a conservative cannot be
made the basis of his choice.
BASIC QUESTION
The basic question is whether
a man in one of those offices
knows his stuff, and the things
he must know, are highly complicated
and very numerous.
Take the appointment of Undersecretary
Joseph C. Grew as
an example. The Undersecretary
is primarily an administrator.
He is only to a minor degree
concerned with policy. The
President and the Secretary determine
policy. The Undersecretary
must maintain contact with
a vast group of subordinates
scattered all over the world. He
must also know hundreds of officials
of foreign governments
here and abroad. He must know
something about the countries
from his own experience, because
he is not dealing with
maps of countries, but with living
nations. Mr. Grew has the
experience and personal qualities
which will enable him to know
and do these things.
THEY’RE SPECIALISTS
The assistant secretaries are
specialists. The law does not
fully prescribe their duties,
hence they can be assigned specific
fields of activity by the Secretary
of State.
Despite the objections of extreme
New Dealers, the appointment
of William L. Clayton
seems wise and appropriate. He
has actually had experience in
the business of foreign trade,
which ought to be definitely advantageous
to this country in
dealing with foreign countries.
Nelson A. Rockefeller has had
no comparable experience in his
field of Latin-American affairs,
but from all reports has done
pretty well in his rather vague
activities with our southern
neighbors.
It is not clear what the misty
and dream-like assignment of
Archibald MacLeish will be. It
is called cultural relations.
Certainly Mr. MacLeish has in
his writings shown little of that
exactitude of thought which is
essential in complicated foreign
affairs and his brief turn as a
propagandist early in the war
was hardly a success.
Yet the over-all effect of this
shake-up cannot help but tone
up the conduct of our foreign
relations.
