The Future
of Poland
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since what Mr. Churchill
calls "the grim bare bones of
the Polish problem" have often
disturbed the peace of Europe,
and since this question may, if
hastily appraised over here, dis-
turb American opinion toward
Britain and Russia, it would
help a great deal if our gov-
ernment would lay before us
the essential facts. For the facts
are plain. They are well known
to the President and the State
Department and to every in-
formed student of European
politics and geography.
But if these facts are not
known, and if, instead of the
facts, people substitute for them
the vague generalities of the At-
lantic Charter, nothing but dis-
trust and dislike of our allies
will result, and bitter disillusion
will come to us even before vic-
tory.
'ESSENTIAL FACTS'
A few of the essential facts
are these: The Poland of 1939
was an ethnic, geographical and
political monstrosity. Its basis
was a fumbling attempt, after
the last war, to satisfy President
Wilson's demand in the Four-
teen Points for a Poland which
would include "Indisputably Pol-
ish populations."
Instead of achieving this lofty
ideal, the whole perimeter of
Poland was the subject of dis-
pute for nearly 20 years. Ger-
many had quarrels over the Pol-
ish Corridor, and this issue pre-
cipitated the war. Russia dis-
puted the whole eastern border.
The Czechs disputed Polish sov-
ereignity in the Teschen coal re-
gion in the southwest. The Lith-
uanians disputed the Polish
seizure of the Vilna region.
THE NEW LINE-UP
In all of these disputes, ex-
cept that with Germany, Poland
was wrong. The section lying
east of the so-called Curzon Line
is inhabited predominantly by
Russians. The Teschen region
was rightfully Czech and Slo-
vak. The Vilna region was not
predominantly Polish.
Of the total population of Po-
land in 1939, which was some-
thing over 33,000,000, only about
60 per cent was Polish.
Churchill's proposition, which
he assures us is perfectly agree-
able to Stalin, would give Po-
land undisputed boundaries,
about 27,000,000 people, a con-
siderable seacoast, two fine
ports and a well-knit economic
unity. The area south of
Koenigsberg is populated most-
ly by Slavs. The Germans in the
territory ceded to Poland can be
moved. It is about time to do
that, for if Europe had ever tak-
en the time to move 3,000,000 or
1,000,000 people, it might have
saved 30,000,000 or 40,000,000
lives.
It ought to be said, in fair-
ness to Russia, that even when
Poland was partitioned in 1939,
Russia refused Hitler's offer of
more Polish territory west of
the Curzon Line. Then, as now,
Russia stood pat on what she
had taken, and any ethno-
graphic map proves her claim.
