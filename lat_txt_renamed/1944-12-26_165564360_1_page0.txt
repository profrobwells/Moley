Mr. MacLeish
and His Job
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Senate confirmation of
Mr. Archibald MacLeish as As-
sistant Secretary of State was
narrower than the figures 43 to
25 might seem to indicate. The
number of votes cast against
him was far beyond the average
in such appointments. Two or
three dissents are about all that
are usually registered, and a
great number of appointments
go through unanimously.
The MacLeish escape from the
Foreign Relations Committee
was melodramatic and breath-
taking. The vote was even. Sen.
Wagner was called on the tele-
phone; Sen. Nye could not be
found, and so the nomination
went to the floor. Mr. MacLeish,
who has said in poetry such un-
kind things about the machine
age, was saved by a product of
individual invention and capital-
istic enterprise. Perhaps in grati-
tude the Poet Laureate of the
New Deal might give us an ode
—a joyous ode—glorifying the
Bell System.
Senatorial doubts, as well as
those of many of us on the out-
side, were doubts not only about
Mr. MacLeish, but about the
curious nature of the job for
which he was nominated. For
when a man of Mr. MacLeish’s
autocratic opinions is nominated
for a job whose nature seems
to go to vital matters of free-
dom, people are entitled to some
concern about what’s going to
go on.
FEAR LACK OF CLARITY
Mr. MacLeish’s more thought-
ful critics, even in the Senate,
do not object to him because
he is a poet. They discern in
him, rather, a lack of admin-
istrative experience, of expert-
ness in foreign affairs and of
that clarity of thought and ex-
pression which would seem to
be essential to the job for which
the President selected him. His
turn with the O.F.F. earlier in
the war was not successful.
Moreover, the views on political
subjects expressed in his poems
and speeches are certainly very
far to the left of what Mr.
Roosevelt has promised in his
campaign speeches.
But the most disturbing thing
about Mr. MacLeish’s occupancy
of the position in the State De-
partment for which the Presi-
dent selected him is his tendency
to regard the means of public
expression as something to be
mobilized by the state. In fact,
the word “mobilize” appears so
frequently in Mr. MacLeish’s
prose utterances that real lovers
of freedom have good reason for
alarm. In a chapter of a few
hundred words in his book, “The
American Cause,” written in
1941, the word “mobilize” ap-
pears 28 times. A master of
words reveals his state of mind
by a repetitious choice of that
sort.
The interests, described as a
part of our foreign service in
the office in question, are mat-
ters which should be handled
by someone who has the most
profound belief that media of
public expression should not be
mobilized. Freedom and mobili-
zation are mutually inconsistent.
The mobilization of writers,
teachers and artists is exactly
what we do not want in this
country.
