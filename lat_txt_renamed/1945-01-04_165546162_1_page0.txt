A New Form
of Society?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sewell Avery's dispute with
the President carries to this
country an issue that makes all
the issues discussed in the re-
cent campaign pale by compari-
son. For stripped of all super-
ficialities, it is whether powers
designed to assure continuity of
war production may, by execu-
tive discretion, recreate un-
established peacetime conditions
in a large segment of American
life. The question whether the
President's theories were, by de-
sign or coincidence, to change
American society was not
squarely put by Candidate Dew-
ey. But specific conflicts like
the Montgomery Ward case will
point the way. And the implica-
tions of the President's budget
message may provide further
guidance.
BASIC ISSUE
The basic issue is how far a
government can go not merely
to guarantee the essentials of
life, but standards of work and
of living which are at variance
with the laws of supply and de-
mand. This issue becomes sharp-
er with every invention that
increases the productivity of the
individual worker.
After the Pilgrim Fathers ar-
rived, they did not ask the hills
of Massachusetts to provide so-
cial security and the right to
a job. Before them was the in-
flexible natural directive that
to make a living in America
they had to work and work hard.
But their claims were modest,
They were only a piece of land
large enough to provide food
and shelter for themselves and
for their families. Had there
been no increase in that demand,
we would have no social prob-
lems today. For there is still
land and the products of land
in abundance.
THE PROBLEM
But the major economic fea-
ture of modern civilization, es-
pecially emphasized in this gen-
eration, is that the volume of
production rises higher and
higher, while the need for hu-
man beings to produce that vol-
ume grows less and less.
Perhaps in the efforts of
Messrs. Roosevelt and Avery to
win support for their points of
view, we see the earliest efforts
to create a philosophy or,
rather, two alternative philoso-
phies for this new form of so-
ciety. At this stage in the ar-
gument, it looks as if Mr. Avery
is closest to the position on
which one of these philosophies
must stand. For the Avery posi-
tion retains the principle of in-
dividual freedom and initiative,
while the Roosevelt position sug-
gests, but does not define, an
alternative. Perhaps he never
can define an alternative that
will work in a free country. No
one yet has defined it, although
many have tried.
Suppressed Desire
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
Two hundred women staged a
two-hour riot and carried off all
the butter and sugar in a gro-
cery store in New York State.
They can, it seems, go without
a good old-fashioned sale for just
so long.
