The Virtue
of Resigning
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sharp reminder of the strange
administrative practices which
prevail in the executive branch
of our government comes in
the case of Benjamin V. Cohen,
general counsel for War Mobili-
zation Chief James F. Byrnes.
Mr. Cohen resigned last Thurs-
day and then reconsidered. His
reason for resigning was the
fact that the White House had
passed him over in recent im-
portant appointments in the
State Department.
Nearly 12 years ago, in April,
1933, Messrs. Cohen and James
M. Landis were brought to
Washington to carry out the
President’s recommendations for
a securities act. This was done
under the auspices of Chairman
Sam Rayburn of the House Com-
mittee on Interstate Commerce.
A year later, Mr. Cohen had the
leading role in drafting the Se-
curities Exchange Act. These
legislative achievements brought
great recognition to Messrs. Lan-
dis and Rayburn. The former
became a member and, later,
chairman of the S.E.C., the lat-
ter minority leader and, later,
Speaker of the House.
HIS HISTORY
Mr. Cohen continued with ex-
tremely important but unpub-
licized tasks. He was justly re-
garded in the New Deal as per-
haps its ablest lawyer and cer-
tainly its most skilled bill drafts-
man.
He has seen more conspicu-
ous statesmen rise on the wings
of plumage which he fashioned.
He has seen eight lawyers ele-
vated to the Supreme Court, not
more than two of whom are in
his class as a lawyer. He has
seen three Attorneys General
appointed, not one of whom is
as good a lawyer. He has seen
a swarm of lesser lawyers ap-
pointed to Federal courts. He
was sent to England, apparently
to see the new and inexperi-
enced Ambassador Winant
through his early days in office
there. He has been at Mr. Byrnes’
right hand. He served ably in
the Dumbarton Oaks Conference.
He has never been a man to
complain, but apparently 12
years of meager recognition are
too much even for this patient
Griselda of the New Deal.
