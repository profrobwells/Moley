Hitler's Picture of Defeat
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The dispute between Sen.
Wheeler and the administration
seems to narrow down to the
question of who is helping Hitler
and why. Sen. Wheeler asserted
that the war objective of "un
conditional surrender" has stiff.
ened the resistance of Germany,
thus enabling Hitler to make his
place more secure. The State
Department, no doubt reflecting
the President's sentiments con-
cerning his old antagonist, the
senator, retorted that state
ments like Mr. Wheeler's were
helping Hitler.
Perhaps the best witness on
this thorny subject is Hitler
himself. His New Year's speech
when carefully examined, re
veals most of the line of argu
ment which he feels will stiffen
German resistance. Since Hit
ler determines what shall be told
the German people, and since
the Germans are resisting fierce
ly, we must assume that Hitler
is responsible.
LOSS OF HUNGARY
The Fuchrer's speech is the
usual conglomeration of false
hood and empty promise. But
it differs from other Hitlerian
utterances in several particulars
Surprisingly enough, Hitler
writes of Hungary as lost. This
is apparently to provide an an
swer when, later on, Austria be
gins to cry out that Hitler has
deserted it. His explanation of
the loss of Hungary is that it
has treacherously deserted him
--a suggestion meant to tell
Austria that if it is loyal to him,
it will not fall to the Russians.
Then he tells the German peo
ple that if they lose, 15,000,000
to 20,000,000 will be deported
presumably to labor in Russia.
His use of these figures is
strange, since he refers, no
doubt, to the Varga plan to use
the labor of 10,000,000 Germans
for 10 years in rehabilitating
Russia. Perhaps he wanted to
get away from the figure of
10,000,000 because that is the
approximate number of enforced
foreign workers now in Ger
many. He forgets that Varga
wants part of them to work in-
side Germany.
Hitler's main argument, how-
ever, is that if Germany is re-
duced to an agricultural state, as
suggested by the Vansittart-Mor-
genthau idea, it will starve.
This is patently ridiculous, since
Germany could feed itself and
do so with greater ease if the
present slave laborers are per-
mitted to leave and other mil-
lions of Germans are deported.
THE FARM ARGUMENT
His reason for underlining the
horrors of an agricultural econ-
omy is the traditional feeling of
Germans that agricultural labor
is slavery. This feeling arises
from the historical fact that la-
bor on the Junker estates in
Northern Germany, especially
in Mecklenburg and in East
Prussia, was a degraded form
of peonage. Hitler made much
of that fact in his early political
rise to power and he won over
millions of farm workers by that
appeal.
In this recent speech he also
made a great deal of the ability
of Germany to keep up produc-
tion in underground factories,
despite bombing. This state-
ment may have some truth and
its emphasis may lessen our con-
fidence in precision bombing.
Hitler also paints a rosy picture
of how rapidly Germany can be
rebuilt after the war. This, it
would seem, is to enlarge the
Germans' hope in life after the
war, if a negotiated peace can
be secured by bitter resistance.
Nowhere in the speech does
he refer specifically to the slo-
gan of "unconditional surrender"
by name, but by establishing a
number of the conditions an out-
right defeat would bring, he is
clearly seeking to put his pic-
ture of those conditions into the
space left vacant by the failure
of the Allies to state conditions
themselves.
