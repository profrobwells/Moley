It begins to look as if Mr.
Roosevelt was not very smart,
after all, in stirring up the Jones-
Wallace affair. This conclusion
rises not from his failure to de-
liver what Wallace wanted—be-
cause it is very doubtful that
Mr. Roosevelt wanted to deliver
what Mr. Wallace wanted—but
from the fact that by suggesting
Wallace as Pooh-Bah and lord
high everything else of spend-
ing he got Congress and every-
body else nervous about the dan-
gers of permitting the post-New
Deal to play with 30 or 40 bil-
lion loose dollars.
Now, regardless of what hap-
pens to Wallace, something will
be done about something that
has cried out for action all along.
That is where the lack of Presi-
dential smartness comes in.
THAT LETTER!
Of course, there are those self-
styled wise guys in Washing-
ton who were saying that it was
a very smart move. They said:
“The boss wanted to get rid of
Jones and he had to do some-
thing for Wallace and Hillman.
So he did it all with one act.
Pretty smart!”
These wise fellows admitted
that the President’s letter to
Jones was a mistake. By putting
a higher value on the Wallace
campaign speeches than on the
Jones public service he was pro-
claiming to the world a denial
of his protestations of devotion
to the principle of efficiency over
politics.
WHAT IT DID
But here the wisdom of the
insiders ended. They did not
realize that making a great is-
sue over Wallace and creating
an enormous public interest in
the R.F.C. as an instrument of
government practically com-
pelled Congress to create fur-
ther safeguards around the lend-
ing agencies of government. And
the George bill is only the be-
ginning of such safeguards.
The R.F.C. will be in the
broad daylight now, with every
neighborly eye fixed on every
prospective borrower. It may
well be that the New Deal post-
war plans will never reach full
stature after this.
The question may be asked at
this point whether Mr. Roose-
velt actually wanted to go to the
left. The best answer to that
was his nomination of Aubrey
Williams as Administrator of
Rural Electrification. Williams
is farther to the left than Wal-
lace. No President who intend-
ed to turn to the right would
have made that appointment.
NOT SO SMART
No, Mr. Roosevelt really likes
the ideas that Wallace likes, but
he has given those ideas a great
handicap by encouraging the
public to believe they are ex-
clusively Wallace ideas.
THE SCARE
Small business is still due to
get material relief. The so-called
Taft plan embodied in Senate
Bill 1777 in the 78th Congress
was close to the idea suggested
by Wallace in his testimony to
the Senate. That plan, sponsored
by the conservative Sen. Taft,
would have set up a small busi-
ness finance corporation in the
Department of Commerce with
authority to guarantee $500,-
000,000 in loans to businesses
capitalized at less than
$1,000,000 and to guarantee the
same amount of stock in small
businesses held by investment
companies. Perhaps Wallace did
not know the author of the basic
idea, although he presided over
the Senate in which it was in-
troduced.
It was not his statements
about aid to small business
which alarmed people when Wal-
lace spoke; it was the associa-
tion of such aid with a man of
the ideology and political ambi-
tions of the former Vice-Pres-
ident. For that scare, the Presi-
dent must assume responsibility.
