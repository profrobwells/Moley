The wholesale transportation
of Japanese industries to Man-
churia, now reported by our 20th
Air Force headquarters, as well
as by Tokyo, may have an im-
portant bearing on Russia's final
attitude toward Japan. This
adds another factor in the self-
interest of Russia and strength-
ens the view that the Soviet
government will, in its own
good time, help us in Asia. For
Russia can hardly view with in-
difference a little Germany grow-
ing up south of the rich re-
sources of Siberia.
Japanese industry is already
well established in Manchuria.
The Japanese have 5,000,000 sol-
diers on the mainland, and a
considerable industry is essen-
tial to their maintenance. Now,
with the reality of bombing over
the homeland, Japan has an
added incentive to increase the
industrial plant in the wide
spaces of Manchuria and, per-
haps, in China.
FURTHER REMOVAL
A further removal of the island
plants is quite possible. Unlim-
ited manpower is available. Con-
siderable shipping is still avail-

able. The plants to be moved
are near the sea. Such transfers
are far less difficult than the
great migration of Russian fac-
tories from White Russia to the
Urals.
Most Americans have forgot-
ten that we once began such a
movement of industry. In the
hard, cold winter of 1917-18, our
Eastern States, especially New
England, were frozen up early
and fast. Coal was short. Some
equipment was moved to the
Middle West, although no sizable
transfers of entire factories were
made. There has been a consid-
erable shifting around of indus-
try in Germany during this war.
OTHER FACTORS
But Russia's possible partici-
pation in the war against Japan
will be influenced by many fac-
tors other than a fear of Japa-
nese industry in Manchuria. It
is Manchuria itself which sticks
in the long Muscovite memory.
Russians remember that, ex-
actly 50 years ago this spring,
they secured from China a con-
cession to build a railway
through Manchuria to the sea.
Russia, in turn, obtained a loan
for China which enabled her to
pay her war indemnity to Japan.
Russians also remember the dis-
astrous steps by which Japan
pushed them out of Manchuria
and took over ice-free Port Ar-
thur. The failure of Imperial
Russia to hold her place in Asia
created a wave of protest which
ultimately ended in revolution.
Stalin is the culmination of that
protest. He has not forgotten
Manchuria.
The circumstantial evidence
that Russia is to play a part in
defeating Japan is that when
Yalta and Bretton Woods are
added together, a considerable
quid pro quo is missing. Russia
receives more by far than she
gives in these two agreements.
The missing factor may very
well be her promise of some sort
of action against Japan.
