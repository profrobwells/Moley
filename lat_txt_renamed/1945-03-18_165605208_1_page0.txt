The fall of Danzig will mark
the end of a state built upon a
theory rather than a fact. In
their effort to provide for a land
locked Poland within Wilson's
specification of "a free and un
hampered exit to the sea," the
peacemakers of the World War
created the free state of Danzig.
it was then provided that the
frontiers of this artificial state
should be determined by pleb
iscite. As a result, the final
peace treaty gave to Poland the
corridor along the Vistula River
and thus separated Germany
from Danzig and East Prussia.
The Poles, by the terms of the
treaty, were to have access to
the sea through Danzig. The
city of Danzig, though free, was
predominantly German in pop-
ulation,
NEVER HAPPY
For this reason, the Poles
were never happy in their rela-
tions with Danzig. The free
state got all manner of favors
and subsidies from the father-
land and made the life of Polish
traders difficult. The Poles
thereupon built up, in the Polish
environment of the corridor, the
port of Gdynia, with docks and
warehouses in the best Amer-
ican style. The new port served
Polish traders, the small Polish
merchant marine and the infant
Polish navy.
Meanwhile, after Hitler came
to power in Germany, S.S. and
S.A. troops began to appear in
the hospitable streets of Danzig.
The tiny republic used its free-
dom to put a thoroughly Nazi
government into power.
FORMALLY UNITED
"Popular" demonstrations
were arranged by the Nazis, and
finally, as the war broke out,
Danzig was formally united with
Germany. Thus, the festering
sore created by a state which
was free only theoretically be-
came the immediate occasion for
the present great war.
The agreement at Yalta will
deny Poland the exceedingly
fine port of Koenigsberg in East
Prussia. That will go to Rus-
sia. But Poland will get Danzig
and a large part of the rest of
END OF A THEORY
East Prussia. It will also have
the Polish region around Gdynia
and a considerable area to the
west.
A DIFFERENT WAY
When Churchill announced
the British agreement with Rus-
sia on the Polish question, he
indicated that the German pop-
ulation resident there would be
transferred to Germany. If this
policy is followed, the reunion
with the fatherland for which
the people of Danzig cried out
will indeed be their lot. But in
a way quite different from what
they anticipated.
Yet it will be no easy task,
for Danzig's population is heav-
ily German and before the war
it was 400,000. Such an enforced
mass movement of population
would be an unusual if not un-
precedented experiment. It is
too early to predict whether
such an experiment could be
carried out. But we do know
that the Wilsonian experiment
of a theoretically free but ac-
tually German state serving the
needs of an unfriendly Poland
will not be tried again.
