To postpone the San Francisco
conference would involve great
difficulties. The appointed date
is not far distant, and in a con-
ference of this magnitude the
physical preparations are stu-
pendous. Delegations from dis-
tant countries are no doubt al-
ready on the way. Traveling
becomes more difficult as the
war approaches a climax. Loads
of documents and assorted pa-
pers must go from Washington
and the other major capitals.
But these considerations are
small compared to the dangers
involved in the present state of
unpreparedness on the major
issues to be considered.
WHAT IS NEEDED
There appeared to be some
langer a while ago that public
opinion would expect too much
of the conference. Now it is
lear that the public reaction
will be extremely skeptical. If
the conference is held, some
nighty decisions will have to
come out soon to re-establish
public confidence, for it has been
severely knocked about since
Yalta.
Regrettably, the blame for
much of this failure must fall
upon the President. We have
seen repeated almost every de-
fect that has always character-
ized his handling of foreign pol-
icy. He still uses amateurs and
personal cronies in great inter-
national affairs. His State De-
partment and major diplomatic
agents abroad offer no great as-
surance of confidence to the pub-
lic.
Secretary Stettinius is a man
of real capacity, but it is evident
that he must handle things only
as the agent of a President who,
because of absences from Wash-
ington and preoccupation with
many other problems, cannot
give diplomacy sufficient per-
sonal direction.
There is also plain the tenden-
cy to improvise from day to day
which has always been the Presi-
dent's great weakness in foreign
affairs. The fuss over the votes
in the proposed Assembly shows
this. This matter is not really
important because, under the
Dumbarton Oaks plan, the As-
sembly is largely limited to dis-
cussion. With a veto in the
Council of the proposed league,
Russia and the United States
would be as well served by one
assemblyman as by three.
But the plan agreed to at Yalta
was kept secret, thus magnifying
its significance far beyond what
was warranted. Then the plan
for three votes was announced.
FUMBLING DIPLOMACY
At last we shift our position with
the meaningless gesture of pro-
posing to reduce our votes to
one.
What was the purpose of this?
To shame Russia into renounc-
ing two of its votes? If so, what
must the Russian government
think of such coquettish be-
havior? What is this meeting
at San Francisco to beâ€”a game
of competitive throwaway or an
effort to write a constitution of
the world?
LESSON OF HISTORY
Once before, in 1933, an inter-
national conference was held in
which all the great issues were
undecided before the meeting
began. When things started,
delegates wandered around in a
fog, trying to learn by remote
control what Mr. Roosevelt was
currently thinking. The whole
conference fell to pieces. Is the
San Francisco meeting running
into the same shallow water?
If that be true, any inconven-
ience caused by a postponement
would be worth while. For the
glow of victory, at arms should
not be dimmed by an exhibition
of fumbling diplomacy.
Is this the experienced hand
in foreign affairs that campaign
orators told us was indispensable
in the four years ahead?
