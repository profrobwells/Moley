Raymond Moley-
Two weeks ago I presented in
this column some aspects of a
treaty with Mexico governing
the waters of three international
rivers. The treaty is now under
serious debate in the Senate. I
presented in the column a num-
ber of points relating to the
Colorado River waters offered
in a letter from Herbert Hoover
to Sen. Albert W. Hawkes of
New Jersey. The Texas people
are now presenting the vital
concern of Texas about those
aspects of the treaty which deal
with the Rio Grande.
The deal with Mexico mus
becomes a matter not so much
of an issue between the two
parties to the treaty as between
the two great States of Califor-
nia and Texas. The two rivers
present entirely different inter-
national problems. The Colo-
rado is wholly within the Unit-
ed States, except for the lower
hundred miles. These are in
Mexico.
WHAT TREATY DOES
Twelve hundred miles of the
Rio Grande is a boundary. Ex-
cept for international amenities
and contractual obligations, we
can do as we wish with the bulk
of the Colorado water. Mexico,
however, can profoundly affect
the amount of water reaching
the Lower Rio Grande. It can
tap the tributaries on the Mex-
ican side and use the water for
Mexicans. The treaty provides
international means of con-
trolling the flow of Rio Grande
water of mutual benefit to both
countries.
The American residents of the
Lower Rio Grande Valley are
more vitally concerned than any
others in this control. Here is
what Texans call the "magic
valley." The water of the Rio
Grande has created a rich civil-
ization there. Its soil is extreme-
ly well adapted to the growing
of citrus fruits, cotton and vege-
tables. It produces one-ninth of
the total agricultural, income of
Texas. But the river, due to un-
satisfactory international uses, is
failing this area.
RUNNING DRY
I can best present their case
by quoting a letter addressed to
me by a prominent citizen of
Harlingen, Harry Foehner, edi-
tor of the Valley Morning Star:
"We would like to have you
know that right now the Rio
Grande River, which is also in-
volved in the treaty, is running
dry and the few stagnant pools
of water left in the river bed are
so salty that they are worth less
than nothing for irrigation.
"Please consider that even
though the United States con-
tributes all of the water in the
Colorado, Mexico contributes 60
per cent of the water in the Rio
Grande below Ft. Quitman.
"Americans made the earliest
use of Lower Rio Grande water,
and then Mexico began building
dams on her tributaries cutting
off the supply of which Ameri-
CALIFORNIA VS. TEXAS
cans had been making beneficial
use.
"Treaties have to be reciprocal.
If the $300,000,000 winter resort,
fruit and vegetable industry in-
vestments in this area are not to
dry up and blow away even as
the Dust Bowl did some years
ago, we have got to have a treaty
with Mexico permitting the con-
struction of dams which will
conserve floodwaters which now
waste into the sea."
OUT OF WATER
"We are out of water now.
California is worrying about the
future. Last summer is still
fresh in our memories when
even city water was rationed,
crops dried up and we didn't
know when we would get water
until Mexico magnanimously re-
leased some of the water that
she had stored on one of her
tributaries. She was under no
obligation to do so and is under
no future obligation again to
release water unless the treaty
is signed."
The serious administrative de-
fect in the treaty which Mr.
Hoover pointed out has been
met by a reservation offered by
Sen. Connally, which gives Con-
gress control over expenditures
agreed to by the American rep-
resentative on the proposed In-
ternational commission. There
will be further debate on the
treaty, but the best guess on
Senate opinion is that with some
reservations the treaty will finally
be confirmed.
