Raymond Moley-
The sweep of Allied armies
into Germany is unrolling the
most serious problem of civil
and military administration the
war has yet produced. A vast
area of a heavily populated
country with thousands of big
and little cities and villages is
falling into our hands.
Civil administration of some
sort must go on, and no foreign
force of civil administrators,
however well trained, can conduct
such operations. There can be
control by Allied officers, but
the details of administration
must be carried out by Germans
of some sort or description.
Thousands of Mayors and
Burgomeisters with all the lesser
local bureaucracy necessary for
government must be installed.
With dependable German chief
officials, this problem of local
government can be carried on
after a fashion. But the determination of dependability must
be made with care. And after
officials are selected by us, some
sort of protection must be afforded
them. The assassination of the
Mayor of Aachen suddenly
presents us with striking evidence
of how difficult it is to provide
that sort of pattern.
There are, it is clear, institutions
in Germany which can be useful
in selecting dependable German
officials. One of them is the
Catholic Church. Protestant
clergymen of the Niemoeller
group also will be useful. There
are remnants of the old conservative
labor organizations that can help.
But the official class, impregnated
over two decades with Nazi
terroristic ideology, is very dangerous.
Apparently the late Franz
Oppenhof was selected by the
Allies because of his relationship
with the Catholic Church. He had
been a lawyer in Aachen and
Duesseldorf and had, as a client,
the Catholic archdiocese. Such
evidence as we have indicates
that he was making progress in
getting things going in his devastated
city.
Oppenhof was apparently killed
by Nazi "freedom fighters." The
Nazis claim that another such
Mayor has been blown up with
his family in the village of
Muetzenich, south of Aachen.
Despite the sinister implications
of terrorism in conquered territory,
the orderly habits of the mass of
Germans, the existence of great
religious bodies and remnants of
other old groups can be counted
on to work for law and order. The
Nazis in occupied countries fought
the underground by armed protection
of natives put into office and by
intimidation through the execution
of hostages and the seizure of
property. The Allies can provide
armed protection, but measures
of retaliation can hardly be taken.
