If Secretary of State Stettinius
thinks he has had a hard and
controversial week or two, he
should he reminded that he
"ain't seen nothing yet." Dis-
cussions of seats and chairman-
ships are mere preliminary flur-
ries. Wait till the real stuff
comes along.
For example, Tito is in Trieste
and Fiume, and he will prob-
ahly claim from Italy not only
those ports, but the whole of
the attractive Istrian Peninsula
and Carinthia.
THE OLD SQUABBLE
Thus reappears the squabble
which caused Woodrow Wilson
in Paris to order his ship, the
George Washington, to be ready
for his, return to America. Italy
claimed and finally secured the
valuable outlet of the Austrian
Empire to the sea. Yugoslavia's
claim was that a large majority
of the population of the disputed
wedge of territory was of Yugo-
slavic origin, Bad feeling lin-
gered for 25 years.
Now Tito is a victorious ally,
and Italy is an ex-enemy and a
feeble cobelligerent.
The Istrian Peninsula is of
great strategic importance. It is
close enough to the Brenner
Pass to dominate that route be-
tween Germany and Italy. Po-
litically, it would extend the
Slavic sphere of influence to the
Adriatic at the very gates of
Venice.
France already has shown an
Interest in annexing part of the
Italian Riviera. She has no
legitimate claim to it on the
basis of necessity or security,
but since the getting is good,
she will be an applicant for it
at the peace table.
JUST BEGINNING
OUR NEW ROLE
ernment in a liberated country
should be, we shall more and
more appreciate what it means
to be a world power and a world
power clearly pledged to pro-
mote international security also.
We shall fulfill only a minor
part of our commitment when
we enter a league. We must
take positions in a long succes-
sion of decisions about matters
which have never before been
And these are only indications
of what is to come!
As American influence is
drawn deeper and deeper into
these boundary questions, as
well as into the questions of
what a good or legitimate gov-
of the slightest concern to us.
The questions hound up in
making these decisions cannot
be resolved on any simple
formula. They do not merely in-
volve the questions of whether
we are for or against Russia
or for or against Britain. They
will involve nationalistic, racial,
religious and economic differ-
ences of all sorts.
MANY COMPROMISES
In the various countries we
shall recognize, we shall have
many kinds and colors of po-
litical regimes to judge. The is-
sue will never be a clear-cut
choice between ideal repub-
licanism and some debased
breed of tyranny..
We can scarcely go on chok-
ing at Communist gnats while
we are swallowing reactionary
camels. Since we have decided
to travel the road of world poli-
tics, we shall be making stop-
overs at some queer tourist
camps.
Out.
