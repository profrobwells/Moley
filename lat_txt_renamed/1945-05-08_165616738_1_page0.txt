Raymond Moley.
The return to France of those
ex-rulers of unhappy days, whom
Pertinax called the "gravedig.
gers," is one of the ominous
signs of postwar troubles. The
ghosts who have turned their
faces to the west represent every
shade of prewar politics and
each, it may be expected, will
have a following of some sort in
liberated France.
Some of these apples of dis
cord were, no doubt, deliberate
ly tossed into de Gaulle's terri
tory by Nazis diabolically clever
to the last in the art of trouble
making. Certainly, the return
of Petain, unharmed and in good
order and afforded means of
transportation and a large staff
in line with the German esti
mate of his service to them, was
a Nazi plant.
INTENDED EFFECT
Petain's return has had the
intended effect. The F.F.I. is
furious. Its fear, of course, is
that Petain will be the center
of a widespread suppressed, but
potent sympathy, based partly on
his military service to France
and partly on his more recent
suppression of Socialists and la
bor unions. Half-hidden propa-
ganda in Petain's name will cen-
ter on the refrain of a return to
the old national glory of France.
If Petain should be summa-
rily tried and punished, this
propaganda will say that the
leftists are promoting a purge.
If he is liberated, he will be pro-
moted again as a moth-eaten
grand old man. So he is de-
tained. Justice will probably
move with slow steps, no doubt
in the hope that since he cannot
live forever, nature may step in
and prevent embarrassment of
any sort.
LAVAL'S CASE
Laval is something else again.
He has no prestige, but he has
followers and a considerable ca-
pacity for mischief.
The problem of Gamelin is
that of giving or refusing merci-
ful permission to live in obscur-
ity. He was apparently the
hungling product, of a stupid
regime.
BLAME LIKELY
Paul Reynaud is coming home,
too. His offense is not treason.
He lost his head in a crisis,
failed to link French fortunes
THE GHOSTS GO WEST
with Britain's and failed to move
his government to Africa. No
doubt he will blame Lebrun,
whose feeble indecision revealed
itself long before the crisis ar-
rived. In 1936, when Hitler oc-
cupied the Rhineland, the
French Cabinet stood 50-50 for
war. War then might have
proved favorable to France. Le-
brun threw his decisive influence
to the side of peace. He later
sent Daladier to Munich.
Daladier, like Gamelin, is an-
other harmless incompetent.
Oblivion is the best he can ex-
pect.
HERRIOT TRUE FRIEND
Edouard Herriot alone among
the returned statesmen can still
hold his head erect.
All these men are reminders
of the fact that France's sur-
vival will rest on the precarious
chance that it may find the polit-
ical resources to turn wholly
away from its prewar ways. It
has recovered before from me-
diocrity, misgovernment, cor-
ruption and defeat. This is no
guarantee of the future, but it
offers a hope.
