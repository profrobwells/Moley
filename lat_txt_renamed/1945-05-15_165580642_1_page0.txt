Certainly no one wishes to
contribute to any public com-
placency about the job of de-
feating Japan. But War Mobi-
lizer Fred M. Vinson's report
shows a concern on that score
which is not only in direct con-
trast with the government's
plans of last October, but with
the facts that have developed
since that time.
Last tall, according to a report
made to Sen. George's postwar
commitice, Undersecretary of
War Robert P. Patterson testi-
fied that after the defeat of Ger-
many and prior to the defeat of
Japan, from 200,000 to 250,000 a
month was the maximum num-
ber that the Army could demo-
bilize. Mr. Vinson's present esti-
mate is one-half that figure.
Also testifying before the
George committee last fall was
Robert Nathan, who had been
one of the important figures in
the W.P.B. until 1943 and who
is now the second man in Di-
rector Vinson's organization. Mr.
Nathan said then: "I have taken
into account in this analysis
those who will be released from
the Army and Navy, those who
will be released from war work,
the new additions to the labor
market, the exit of abnormal
entrants and, finally, the in-
crease of 1,500,000 people in 'ac-
ceptable' unemployment.
"In this analysis we find that
in the year between the end of
the war in Europe and the end
of the war in the Pacific we
are going to have additional peo-
ple seeking jobs of from 6,500,000
to 10,000,000, depending on
whether we use the optimistic
or pessimistic estimate of the
number of workers released."
The Vinson report tells us
now that in the course of the
next year the number of un-
employed will rise no more than
1,500,000. This would mean that
8,500,000 would find re-employ-
ment. This is improbable, not to
say impossible.
There is certainly no appar-
THE WAR ON JAPAN
ent change in the Pacific war
that justifies these changes. The
war there has progressed with
astonishing speed. Mr. Vinson
says that the Japanese army
consists of 4,000,000 men. Against
this, it is now suggested that
we need 7,000,000 Americans, to-
gether with some million Brit-
ish, French and Dutch and with
the vast human resources of
China.
If our Army is to be reduced
15 per cent, it is curious that
it should need not less but more
textiles than it did before. Nor
do the new estimates of food re-
quirements indicate a prospec-
tive smaller Army. Certainly, if
the Japanese war ends within
the best estimates that have
been given, we shall be left with
military stock piles of an amaz-
ing size.
It might be well, when the
government gives us a report
like this, to have some specific
reasons why previous reports
have been so far out of line.
