The greatest danger to the
peace of Europe and the solidari-
ty of the United Nations is in
the diabolical cleverness of the
German professional military
class.
The shooting and hanging of
Nazi politicians and generals
will not remove this danger.
Nor will the enforced servitude
of a few millions of fanatical
Nazi partisans. Nazidom should
be rubbed out. But that is only
the beginning of the job. The
Nazis are guilty in only one
war. The German military class
bears guilt in two wars. And un-
less this fact is substantially
faced, it will bring about a third
war.
DOING VERY WELL
This group, strange to say,
seems to be doing very well for
itself these days. Every day it
is permitted to express its opin-
ions through our press. Every
day these professional war-
makers sing the same song, and
we listen to it.
Their theme is threefold.
First, the Nazis caused the war
and misled the German people.
Second, the Russians are beasts
and will next fight Britain and
America. Third, the German gen-
erals will be a useful means of
running Germany once more,
-THE DANGER IN GERMANY
The tank specialist, Gen.
Heinz Guderian, tells us that
Rommel was not a fox, but a
donkey. He refused, Guderian
says, to take his advice in de-
fending Normandy. And then
this son of militarism suggests
that we regard the unpleasant-
ness of the past few years as
just a "football match," after
which we should "shake hands."
We had to accept the surren-
der of Adm. Doenitz, of course.
But the danger in the situation
thus created is that, since the
Doenitz regime must complete
the demobilization of the Ger-
man armies, it may extend its
organizing activities beyond that
into a nice pattern for future
remobilization.
RIFT SOUGHT
In fact, it is quite probable
that Doenitz was not selected
as the new Fuehrer by Hitler at
all, but that his appointment
and the death or removal of Hit-
ler was a military putsch. Doe-
nitz was put over by the gen-
eral staff, which immediately
threw out all Nazi plans for
guerrilla resistance, sabotage
and werewolfing.
At the same time there en-
sued a mad scramble to sur-
render as much of the army as
possible to the western Allies.
This was not only to escape
rougher treatment at the hands
of the Russians, but to impress
upon Britain and America the
differences between Russia and
her allies. Everything these pro-
fessional militarists have been
permitted to say has tended to-
ward creating a rift between the
Allies.
THE NEW GOAT
The general staff in the last
war blamed the German defeat
on the so-called "stab in the
back" from Communist-Inspired
revolutionary movements in Ger-
many. This time, Nazi mentality
is the goat. The general staff is
a formidable German institu-
tion. It has generations of tra-
dition behind it. It has drawn
to itself in every generation the
sharpest brains of the nation. It
can live now, as it were, in
mufti. But its mind will continue
to dwell on war.
Nothing can secure the peace
of Europe but a systematic ex-
tirpation of this class by long
policing, by inspection of schools
and industries and governmen-
tal institutions. That will take
many years, but it will save us
from another war.
If, on the other hand, we
blandly assume that Nazism was
our only enemy, we repeat the
stupid carelessness of 25 years
ago.
