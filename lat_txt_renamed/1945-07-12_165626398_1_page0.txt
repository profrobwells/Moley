That the times inevitably
bring forth the man is clearly
proved in the case of Fred M.
Vinson, Secretary of the Treas
ury to be. His selection is an
almost exact reflection of the
philosophy of government of our
new President. His administra
tion of the Treasury will be
something to watch, if you want
a day-to-day index of the ad
ministration's humidity and
temperature,
It became apparent in the clos-
ing weeks of the Roosevelt re-
gime that Judge Vinson was go-
ing places. President Roosevelt
had taken him off the bench to
serve in the thankless job of
Director of Economic Stabiliza-
tion.
Then, when he decided to put
Henry Wallace into Jesse Jones'
place, things began to happen to
Vinson. The shock to Congress
occasioned by the abrupt remov-
al of Jesse Jones could only be
cushioned by the appointment
of a real Congressional favorite
as Federal Loan Administrator.
Fred M. Vinson was the man
for that job.
When James F. Byrnes grew
weary and sought retirement,
Roosevelt made Judge Vinson
war mobilizer. That appoint-
ment, made 10 days before Mr.
Roosevelt's death, was probably
made at the suggestion of Mr.
Byrnes, whose regard for Mr.
Vinson was very great. And now
he is to be Secretary of the
Treasury. That rapid succession
of promotions is due to no acci-
dent.
The ascendancy of Congress
and of orthodox Democratic par-
ty government was already be-
ginning to dawn in the late
President's declining days. It
burst into reality under Presi-
dent Truman.
During Mr. Vinson's 14 years
in the House, he established a
reputation not unlike that en-
joyed by Mr. Byrnes in the Sen-
ate. Both men had the confl-
dence of their colleagues. They
exercised influence by private
conferences, rather than by ora-
torical exercises. They were
loyal to administration meas-
ures, although neither was a
New Dealer by conviction, As
party men, both felt bound to
follow the party leader.
SECRETARY VINSON
Vinson's policies in the Treas-
ury will likely follow a line
more favorable to business than
that of his predecessor. But it
can by no means be assured
that he will turn sharply to the
right. His recent report for the
Office of War Mobilization and
Reconversion shows his belief in
using the taxing power to
achieve broad economic results,
rather than merely to collect
revenue. He said, among other
things:
"We need to consider and
formulate a total budget in re-
lation to the total economic sit-
uation. A fiscal policy developed
on this basis can stimulate pri-
vate expenditures either by re-
ducing taxes or increasing pub-
lic spending whenever private
spending threatens inflation.
Further, each type of tax and
each type of expenditure must
be appraised in terms of eco-
nomic consequences."
This will not be reassuring to
conservative businessmen and
economists. But it must be kept
in mind that this slanting of tax
policies to meet general eco-
nomic situations is a matter of
degree. The test will be how far
Vinson will go in using deficit
financing to meet unemploy-
ment and deflation.
