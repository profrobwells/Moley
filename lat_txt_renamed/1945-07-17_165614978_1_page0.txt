Do you remember those days,
long ago, when strikes were
called to get more pay and
shorter hours? And when union
labor leaders resisted employers'
welfare projects and said they
wanted their welfare in pay en-
velopes? The complex causes
of current strikes mark a con-
siderable move from those sim-
ple years.
Among these contemporary
causes are the demands of un-
ion labor for an exaction from
the public, through the em-
ployer, of some sort of welfare
fund.
That is one of the character-
istics of the New York City news-
paper and mail deliverers' strike.
A demand was made for a con-
tribution of 3 per cent of the
pay roll to a union welfare fund.
This issue is similar to the suc-
cessful demands made by James
Caesar Petrillo, with a major
difference., The fund would be
administered by a labor-manage-
ment committee with an impar-
tial chairman.
The announced purposes of
these welfare funds show quite
clearly that the unions are
anticipating similar government
plans suggested by Sen. Wagner
and others. Apparently, the un-
ions prefer their own health and
welfare systems, wholly or par-
tially under their control, before
the government has expanded
its paternalism.
The great propaganda for vari-
ous Beveridge systems has thus
affected union labor thinking.
But union labor has decided to
get these benefits first for itself
and then, if government pro-
vides some more, it will have
them, too.
Union labor policy thus favors
a form of paternalism, but a pri-
vately controlled paternalism. It
is not wholly satisfied to throw
its weight into politics and to
force government to levy taxes
for its purposes and needs. It
is for socialism only as a by-
product of its effort. Its chief
concern is to build up its power.
There is no question about the
value of the Petrillo idea as a
means toward power. It
strengthens the hold of leaders
over the union membership and
it adds power to the union in
political campaigns and in bar-
gaining with employers. It also
strengthens a union's jurisdic-
tional position against other un-
ions.
Members are held more se-
curely by such plans. A man
who has built up a right to an
amount equal to half a year's
income, which would be possible
in 15 years under a 3 per cent
plan, would be slow to depart
from the union or go into an-
other line of work. Seniority
would acquire a definite mone-
tary value.
Union leaders have, moreover,
thought up more elaborate wel-
fare plans than almost any em-
ployer ever offered. The unions
used to charge that employers'
welfare plans were offered to
keep unions out and, no doubt,
in many cases that was true.
The same incentive now moves
union labor, but in reverse.
Whether this union labor pol-
icy means a real trend away
from dependence on political ac-
tion and government maternal-
ism is not clear. But it is sig-
nificant that Louis Waldman,
counsel for the Newspaper and
Mail Deliverers' Union, is a for-
mer believer in political action
who has more recently strong-
ly opposed communistic trends
in unions. He has strongly
warned union labor against Sid-
ney Hillman's tactics in New
York politics. Does this present
policy indicate that union labor
leaders are losing faith in a
superpowerful government?
