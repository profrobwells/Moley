The neutrons will explode
many things besides the atom.
Among the more prominent by-
explosions will be every brain
In every country which harbors
a pet idea. Already the line of
I-told-you-so's looks like a group
of prospective customers before
a store with a new supply of
men's shorts.
News services tell us of scores
of pins and wisecracks about
the atom springing up in news-
paper offices. They range from
"Japan has received an atomized
statement" to "Walt Disney has
a new automated cartoon." Night
club entertainers have acquired
a new word to brighten their
assortment of corny jokes.
Reformers of all sorts now
have imaginary evidence to ac-
tivate their nostrums. National
planners see the making of the
bomb a triumph for government
enterprise. The use of the atom-
ic principle will make socialism
inevitable, they say.
Universities see it as an argu-
ment for collecting new funds
for research. Moralists see the

chance for a homily on mind
over matter. The one-worlders
see further shrinkage of the
globe. A Roosevelt idolater
seizes this chance to point out
that the late President's part in
supporting atomic research
makes traitors of those who criti-
cize the late President's family.
The Murray full employment bill
advocates rise to point out the
new importance to be attached
to their bill. And so on and so on.
Much of this is true; but its
utility is doubtful. The birth of
a great discovery should impel
intelligent men to try to deter-
mine how much revision is nec-
essary in their previous axioms
of thought and conduct. It is
scarcely intelligent to use it to
holster previously held theories
and values.
That is especially true of polit-
ical and economic theories. Po-
litical and economic devices re-
sult from, they do not cause,
scientific discovery. They are
conditioned by the known facts
of the physical world. They do
not anticipate. They follow.
The imperative necessities of
war compel minds and hands to
work faster and thus bring forth
many new devices and inven-
tions. But that is not an argu-
ment for war. The governments
of the United States, Britain and
Canada promoted and directed
the research on this bomb. But
that does not prove the general
intelligence and beneficence of
government enterprise. The pres-
ence of the atomic bomb makes
war more terrible and interna-
tional co-operation more neces-
sary. But every step in inven-
tion was proof of that. The atom-
ic bomb does not make big na-
tions small and weak nations
strong. The balance or unbal-
ance among the nations remains
about as it was.
Nor does the rush to incor-
porate the word "atom" in our
slogans and by-words of political
discussion make it any more
valid to try to solve concrete
problems by the use of generali-
ties. The atomic bomb is a sum-
mons to think more clearly. But
that need has always existed. It
is the same world with its prob-
lems a bit more clearly defined
but with solutions still waiting
for the application of reason.
