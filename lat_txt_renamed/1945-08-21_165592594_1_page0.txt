Raymond Moley  HALF-BAKED!
While the administration in
Washington is trying to stam-
pede Congress into passing the
Murray full employment bill,
some thought-provoking sugges-
tions are coming from the peo-
ple who really will do the
employing. In this situation, the
opinion of business should be
taken seriously.
The Committee for Economic
Development has just issued a
carefully prepared report, which
gives estimates of postwar mar-
kets for manufactured goods
made by more than 1500 manu-
facturers and trade associations.
The general tone of these esti-
mates is optimistic. Meanwhile,
Ina Mosher, president of the Na-
tional Association of Manufac-
turers, has made public the
conclusions of a survey of 1700
members of his organization.
Mr. Mosher is also optimistic.
HALF-BAKED THEORIES
Washington, however, is def-
initely alarming in its predic-
tions and, what is worse, is offer-
ing half-baked remedies before
the disease has been identified.
The Committee for Economic
Development, composed of well-
known figures in business and
professional life, points out that
the postwar years can roughly
be divided into three periods.
First, there will be a short pe-
riod during which industry is
reconverting its facilities to
peacetime uses. The second pe-
riod, which will be well under
way in 1947, will be a time when
producers will be filling the de-
mands deferred by the war. The
third, which will presumably be-
gin three years hence, will be-
marked by a shift to a self-sus-
taining or normal basis.
ESTIMATES MADE
The estimates presented by
the committee are for the year
1947. In that year the total labor
force is estimated at 60,000,000.
But from that figure it is esti-
mated that 6,000,000 must be sub-
tracted, because of the men in
the armed forces and the normal
labor "float" or turnover.
The committee's estimate of
demand for goods is high. It is
40 per cent over 1939. If that
proves to be correct, there will
be nearly 54,000,000 available
jobs. As is true of any such
composite estimate, there are
thousands of "ifs" in these fig-
ures. The biggest assumption
is that the government will do
everything possible to remove
restrictive controls and try the
grand experiment of letting
things find a natural level.
PRACTICAL FACT
But the administration's hasty
remedies offer no assurance that
it has any faith in things finding
a normal and healthy level. The
Murray full employment bill is
the assurance in principle that
government spending can aid,
not hinder, abundant private
employment.
A practical fact thereupon con-
fronts the sponsors of the Mur-
ray bill. It is really not an
emergency measure. If Congress
returns in a week or two, hear-
ings will be held before the Sen-
ate committee. The prepara-
tions for that indicate that the
bill can hardly pass the Senate
before early October. Then the
House must spend some weeks
on it. Whatever may be the
optimistic expectations of the
bill's sponsors, they cannot hope
to get it passed and signed be-
fore November.
FAR DISTANT FUTURE
In that case it will be impossi-
ble for the President to collect
for his annual budget the vast
mass of estimates required by
the bill. The operation of the
mechanics of the bill would then
have to go over a year. So the
bill really means that the first
fiscal year for which estimates
will be required will begin on
July 1, 1947.
That's a long time in the fu-
ture in such days as these. About
all the bill would set up, there-
fore, would be a theory of gov-
ernment spending with which a
vast number of our people dis-
agree. There are more immedi-
ate questions which might well
occupy our lawmakers mean-
while.
