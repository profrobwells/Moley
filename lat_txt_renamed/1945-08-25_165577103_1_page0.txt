Raymond Moley---WHOSE CART IS BEFORE WHAT HORSE?
The London Times now follows
the London Economist and the
press and Parliamentary voices
of the Labor party in criticism
of American efforts to stabilize
world finances through Bretton
Woods. When the Bretton
Woods plan was first proposed
over here, it was criticized be-
cause of its British progenitors.
It was pointed out, and properly
so, that the hand of Lord Keynes
was active in its creation.
Now, apparently, British opin-
ion holds that Bretton Woods is
not what they need at all. The
London Times says that Win-
throp W. Aldrich is putting "the
cart before the horse."
CALLED IMPRACTICAL
The Times says further that
the Bretton Woods system is
quite impractical in the present
state of the world. We are once
more confronted with the state-
ment that there should be
"equality of sacrifice"â€”a state-
ment which many of us heard
when the war debts came to a
state of suspended animation, in
1933.
Americans should not rush to
hasty conclusions about this at-
titude of our ally. But a calm
appraisal of the facts should
hurt no one.
NOT A DEBT?
The Economist argues that the
vast lend-lease obligation of
about $29,000,000,000 is really not
a debt at all. Beyond that, Brit-
ain has an external debt of
something more than $16,000,-
000,000. It should be noted here
that this amount is roughly the
same as a full year's national in-
come for Britain in prewar
times.
In the face of this figure, the
Economist argues, neither the
international fund (Bretton
Woods) nor the Export-Import
Bank has sufficient resources to
help Britain back to a free for-
eign trade. A free export and
import system is impossible, as
long as foreign credits in Lon-
don cannot be repaid and must
stay frozen.
PROPOSAL MADE
The Economist's proposition is
that Britain's creditors should
cancel about a quarter of the
debt. Then Britain would pay a
quarter in cash and thus scale
down the debt to about $8,000,-
000,000. Whereupon, the United
States would provide the means
to replace $6,000,000,000 or more
of this with long-term obliga-
tions.
Mr. Aldrich suggested that a
free movement of funds be pro-
vided in and out of London.
This set off Labor party protests,
which seem to find quiet but
positive echoes in Conservative
quarters.
REASON FOR PROTESTS
The protests of labor are, in
large part, the result of the fact
that the Aldrich suggestion im-
plied that labor should with-
hold its plans for a managed
economy. Conservative reaction
is probably the result of resent-
ment that the United States
should make any suggestion
about how Britain should con-
duct her affairs.
It was no easy matter to bring
this country to wholehearted ac-
ceptance of Bretton Woods. The
failure of the British to support
the plan may well set off a good
deal of hitherto suppressed op-
position.
ISN'T IT FAIR?
The loans envisaged by these
recent British suggestions would
enable the new British govern-
ment to finance large plans for
domestic reconstruction, includ-
ing nationalization. Then,
through a nationalized Bank of
England, large loans could go to
Dominion and colonial govern-
ments. All of which would con-
tribute to a situation in England
to which American advocates of
free enterprise are directly op-
posed. In short, opponents of
socialism here cannot under-
stand why the United States
should finance socialism in Brit-
ain. Moreover, it is doubly hard
to do this at a moment when the
Murray-Wagner full employment
bill commits us to the socializa-
tion of job-making here.
If we are going to help Eng-
land, it is only fair to insist that
we do it according to our own
ideas, not those of Britain.
