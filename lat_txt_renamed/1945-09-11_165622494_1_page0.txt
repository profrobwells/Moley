President Truman revived a
good old American custom in
giving Congress a long omnibus
message including everything,
even the kitchen stove. Such a
quiet outpouring of words is
calming. It makes us realize
that the old America is still with
us—the America of surreys and
hoopskirts and the McGuffy
Readers.
It is in the Presidential habit
of Grover Cleveland and William
McKinley. That old America,
after all, is the basis and strength
of our new streamlined nation
which stretches its armed might
from the Elbe River to the Yellow
Sea.
We have become a bit worn
and nervous with Presidential
personal appearances and with
short rescripts to Congress. Mr.
Truman’s series of recommenda-
tions is something for Congress-
men to mull over. It outlines a
winter’s work. Congressmen
will not live from day to day
without knowing what is coming
next. Altogether, the way
President Truman does things,
as well as the substance of what
he says, will help us back to the
feeling of peace which we have
almost forgotten during these
war years.
Another fine quality about the
Truman message is the absence
of impatience or bitterness or
rancor. There are no veiled sug-
gestions of unnamed bad men
who want to scuttle the peace
or bring out old shackles for la-
bor or thrust farmers into the
shadow of peasantry. Taken as
a whole, it is a reasonable docu-
ment with something for every-
body.
The large space which Mr.
Truman gives to the problems
of union labor is an indication
of the fear that exists in Wash-
ington of the political conse-
quences which may come from
unemployment. The President,
once more, gives his support to
the Murray “full employment”
bill. But a comparison of his
interpretation of the bill with
the bill itself indicates that the
President would gladly accept
amendments to the bill which
would soften its positive assur-
ance that the government must
finance work for everyone who
wants to work.
The program of spending
which the message suggests
will not be clear until the budget
message is issued four months
hence. But taken as a whole, it
is about what everybody expect-
ed. There will be general agree-
ment that a considerable body
of public works should be au-
thorized very soon. The great
regional plans for the valleys
of the Columbia, the Missouri,
the Arkansas and the Central
Valley of California are com-
mended and Congress is asked
to proceed with them “as rap-
idly as possible.” The expendi-
tures suggested can hardly be
kept within Treasury receipts,
even when credit is given for
receipts from the sale of sur-
plus property and war plants.
To that extent, the message is
inflationary, and that may be
the reason for the frolic of the
Wall Street bulls. But the calm
tone of the message may have
been a factor in the Wall Street
reaction, also.
The very length of the mes-
sage, however, is an indication
that the President and his ad-
visers are not clear about the
future. Verbosity is the child
of uncertainty. That uncer-
tainty is the reason why no as-
surance is given of an early re-
moval of wartime controls. The
message is not nearly so reas-
suring on that score as was
President Wilson’s message in
December, 1918.
What President Truman gives
us is a mixture of the Roosevelt-
C.I.O. program, the reaffirmation
of a belief in private enter-
prise and an earnest prayer that
a boom may begin which will
make government planning un-
necessary.
