The broad alternatives in the
nation-wide union labor situation
offer interesting lines of specu-
lation.
If substantial wage increases
are granted in important in-
dustries now afflicted with
strikes, other organized trades
will demand more, and wages
everywhere will rise. Minework-
ers will be prominent in the
demands, and coal would be the
commodity most immediately
affected.
THE PROSPECT
What will O.P.A. do when this
comes? It would be confronted
by a fait accompli on the union
labor side-perhaps something
which will have the concurrence
of the administration. There is
evidence that the O.P.A. may
beat a selective retreat. J. E.
Fender of the Structural Prod-
ucts Institute is quoted in the
newspapers to the effect that
O.P.A. orders increasing the
price of clay products will "al-
most immediately" end short-
ages in that field. Meanwhile,
limitations on prices are certain-
ly restraining production in var-
ious lines.
If employers in the lines
where strikes for wage increases
are now going on refuse substan-
tial increases, the strikers will
probably stay out for some time.
The longer they stay out, the
more the complication of recon-
version.
GOVERNMENT'S PLIGHT
If the government considers
taking over plants, it must also
consider whether workers will
go back at the old rates which
were paid under the broken
contracts. If they did go back
under government operation, the
government might be hung up
with properties in normal manu-
facturing or with the technical
problems of reconversion, in-
cluding the reorganization of
sales efforts. Surely, this is no
job for the Army or Navy.
If the workers refused to go
back, the government would be
confronted with almost unprece-
dented embarrassment.
FACING THE CRISIS
Another alternative is an in-
tensification of the government's
effort to keep prices down, even
by court action. During the war,
government put on enough
pressure to keep wages down.
But since the war ended, no gov-
ernment statement on wages has
been made, except that of Wil-
liam H. Davis. And Davis was
deleted.
Or government might decide
against forceful action and wait
in the hope that the strikes
will wear themselves out. This
would be a costly political pro-
cedure. It would invite such
actions by State Governors as
that of Gov. Dewey in the New
York elevator strike. And if the
Governors—especially Republi-
can Governors—succeeded where
the administration had failed,
the Democratic party of Presi-
dent Truman would suffer grave
consequences.
OTHER POSSIBILITIES
There are other serious pos-
sibilities. If the O.P.A. fails to
hold the line, prospective buyers
may decide that they had bet-
ter buy quickly. And the conse-
quences to the prices of land,
houses and stocks might well
be serious. Back in 1920, when
prices were rising briskly, many
owners sold Liberty Bonds to
get money to buy houses and
other things. This depressed the
bonds. The fear of such a situa-
tion, after this war, caused the
government to sell bonds which
may be cashed on demand and
which cannot be sold. These E
Bonds, if turned in now, would
have a decidedly inflationary
effect.
It is a real crisis that we are
facing. It would be most unwise
to fail to recognize it.
