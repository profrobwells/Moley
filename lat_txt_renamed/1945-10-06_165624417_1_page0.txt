Raymond Moley. _ HIGHER WAGES AND UNEMPLOYMΕΝΤ
In a previous column I sug-
gested a number of probable con-
sequences of the present wave
of strikes. Two others are also
important if, as is widely ru-
mored, the government is going
to try to settle things with wage
increases of around 15 per cent.
One of these consequences will
be in international trade; the
other, in city governments,
If the cost of production rises
by any such figure, then the
prices to foreigners would rise.
The wheels in Congress would
start to pay higher subsidies
for the export of farm commodi-
ties. These new farm subsidies
would take time. For other ex-
port goods, subsidies would be
most unlikely.
FRAME OF MIND
We could, of course, sell as
much as we wanted to, if we
were willing to lend the pur-
chasing countries the money to
buy and if the foreign countries
were so eager to get goods that
they wouldn't worry about re-
paying the loans. Probably every
country but England is already
in that frame of mind.
But these sales-through-loans
would be one-time affairs, and, as
other industrial countries began
to offer cheaper goods for cash,
our exporters would find thin-
ning markets. And exporters
would find the most trouble in
keeping the very customers they
want most to keep—that is, the
customers in those countries
where trade offered the greatest
permanence. Canadian custom-
ers would be squeezed the most
by higher prices for our goods.
ANOTHER DENT?
Unless we are able to export
our union labor troubles to Can-
ada, production in Canadian fac-
tories will tend to decline in cost
by comparison with production
in our factories. Some American
companies would throw their for-
eign business to their Canadian
plants, if they could do so. That
would put a dent in employment
in the United States and make
the full-employment idea still
more visionary.
The effect of a general pay rise
on municipal governments would
be very serious. There is strong
support in Congress for a 20 per
cent pay increase for Federal em-
ployees.
SIMILAR PLEAS LIKELY
That would certainly set in mo-
tion a demand for a similar in-
crease in cities, school districts
and States. The Federal govern-
ment is in a better position to
grant such increases, because it
can collect from income taxes or
write it on Uncle Sam's cuff.
The States, school districts and
cities would generally have to
get the money from real estate
and sales taxes.
No doubt, some of the organ-
ized trades in city employment
will demand higher pay at once.
In the face of such a demand, a
city government would find the
fairest course in a general in-
crease for all employees at once.
But such increases are always
difficult to put into effect quickly.
In most cities at least 18 months
would be required.
You either have to reappraise
or induce the public to vote new
tax levies. In a large majority
of cities it is too late to get any
levies into this year's general
election. So special elections will
be in order. They are cumber-
some, expensive and distinctly
hazardous.
DEFICIENCY BORROWING
Even if such levies are passed,
the money doesn't come in until
the next tax bills are paid. De-
ficiency borrowing must tide
things over or money must be
taken from necessary public
works. And if public works are
ever necessary, they are in order
now, when many projects are
ready, and unemployment threat-
ens. On the other hand, if a city
cuts down services to meet high-
er wages, people are laid off.
In both these fields—foreign
trade and local government—the
net effect of higher wages would
be more unemployment.
