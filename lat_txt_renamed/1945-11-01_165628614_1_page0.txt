Raymond Moley. _ JAPAN'S ECONOMIC FEUDALISM
Gen. MacArthur's order that
the great Zaibatsu family com-
bines be broken up reminds us of
the Supreme Court's dissolution
of the Standard Oil and tobacco
trusts. It is easier said than
done. It will take years to re-
adjust Japan's business on the
lines of a truly competitive
economy.
These Japanese family busi-
nesses have followed the course
of early capitalism in Europe.
The Medici family in late me-
dieval Italy was an exporting,
importing and banking combine
with immense power. In Lu-
ther's time, two families in
Augsburg, the Fuggers and the
Walsers, owned the largest uni-
fied businesses outside of Italy.
A SORT OF BRIDGE
These family organizations rep-
resented the bridge between two
systems-feudalism and capital-
ism. As capitalism developed,
the more primitive outfits de-
clined and, ultimately, disap-
peared as business enterprises.
Japan is an example of re-
tarded development. Despite the
modern nature of its products,
its economic and political or-
ganization is three or four cen-
turies behind our own.
FOUR MAIN FAMILIES
Four family enterprises dom-
inate business in Japan. The
oldest of these is the Mitsui,
which, in 1933, published a
jubilee book marking its 300th
birthday. The book showed that
the Mitsui combine, broken into
several dozen affiliates, con-
trolled one-third of Japan's coal
export and one-third of its mines.
It had a large merchant ma-
rine, as well as textile mills,
electrical machinery and loco-
motive works. It had its own
banking institutions. It financed
almost exclusively the Univer-
sity of Commerce in Tokyo,
where it educated the more im-
portant of its quarter-million
employees.
GREAT STRENGTH
The Mitsubishi was somewhat
stronger than the Mitsui in iron
production. In the 1920's the
Mitsubishi claimed 150,000 em-
ployees-a figure which greatly
increased in subsequent years.
The Mitsubishi banks imitated
the irrelevant marble and archi-
tectural wastes of great Ameri-
can banks.
The past strength of these and
other family combines of Japan
was incredible. They developed
on the outskirts of the 19th cen-
tury world's economy.
REASON FOR SUCCESS
One reason for their advan-
tage was the fact that certain
countries like China could not
be adequately served with great
varieties of products by small
or medium-sized Occidental
firms, which were unable to
have considerable numbers of
employees resident in the re-
ceiving countries.
A European, who is now a
citizen of the United States and
who visited Japan in 1941, testi-
fies that the leading members of
these business families were op-
posed to war with us. They
doubted its successful outcome.
On the other hand, they were
interwoven with government to
such a degree that they could
offer no effective opposition to
the militarists.
DIFFICULT TASK
The United States, in order to
see that these enterprises serve
no future war preparations, will
have trouble effectuating any
change in their form or organi-
zation which will not be pure
sham and deceit. It might be
better to keep them concentrated
and turn over top control to
business and official executives
of the United Nations.
Our concern is to use our
power directly and effectively to
prevent the revival of warmak-
ing activity, not to reconstruct
Japan's forms of economic life.
That such forms will rapidly
change under a politically demo-
cratic regime is certain. But
such changes should come from
within, if they are to be per-
manent.
