AN EMPIRE GROWS UP
The presence of British mili-
tary forces in Java is another of
the bitter paradoxes with which
this postwar era is rapidly filling
up. Over the centuries, the
Dutch and the British fought
long wars for supremacy on the
seas and for the lion's share of
colonial riches. The glory songs
of the Dutch still sing the praise
of De Ruyter's defeats of the
British fleet.
Why are the British so eager
to sustain the authority of their
ancient rivals? And, after all,
what is the Dutch interest itself
in this affair?
THE BRITISH CONCERN
The British concern is political
and economic. At a moment
when revolutionary movements
are sputtering in Eastern India
and in Ceylon, success for the
Indonesians would spread like
wildfire in India. Perhaps the
British would rather show the
corrective force of arms some-
where other than in India. The
aftermath of hatred would not
be in a British possession.
Closely related to this political
interest is a serious economic
one. Even the Labor govern-
ment cannot neglect this.
CLOSE TIES
The rubber plantations in the
Dutch Indies and in Malaya are
closely related by agreements
concerning prices and markets.
Most of the rubber plantations in
the Dutch colonies are now in
the possession of British inter-
ests. It is doubtful if a free Indo-
nesian government would be
sympathetic to the re-establish-
ment of former agreements.
A similar situation prevails in
the petroleum industry, in which
the Royal-Dutch Shell is owned
by both British and Dutch. With
the world's petroleum situation
in its present shape, the British
cannot afford to lose these raw
material connections.
Holland has been master of
these islands for over 300 years.
In the 19th century there was
severe criticism of Dutch colonial
practices, even in Holland itself.
A book about the unhappy fate
of the Indonesians, published by
an anonymous "Multatuli," had a
popularity in Europe somewhat
similar to "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
and at about the same time as
the Beecher book.
It is unnecessary to suggest
that all subject races are on the
march toward liberty, as the late
Wendell Willkie suggested. The
unrest which is manifesting it-
self in so many places is proba-
bly not inspired by abstractions.
But the war has stirred up things
in many places, and, in the tur-
moil, native leaders are coming
to the surface with appeals to
native desires for a larger share
in native riches.
TREATMENT IMPROVED
The Dutch have radically im-
proved their treatment of their
colonies in the past 100 years
and have invested very large
sums of money in their empire.
Returns from those investments
have made Holland prosperous,
although it must be said in fair-
ness that much of the wealth
taken from the colonies has been
reinvested.
Dominion status for the islands
has been most frequently sug-
gested as a solution. This could
be arranged in a manner which
would continue the economic ad-
vantages now possessed by the
Dutch and British. The perma-
nence of such a status would be
doubtful. The Indonesians ap-
parently feel that the Dutch are
not strong enough to hold the
country and provide protection
against future aggressors. Nor
can the threat of British inter-
vention be a permanent restraint.
The prospect is that of great in-
stability.
