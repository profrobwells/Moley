Complaints are made by un-
ions and by buyers that some-
thing very much like a strike is
going on among the manufac-
turers of cotton goods. Purchas-
ing possibilities in many whole-
sale lines are fewer than at al-
most any time during the war.
This means that consumers are
greatly inconvenienced, that
jobs are not being produced and
that taxes cannot be collected
on profits which are not made.
One reason for this is a con-
tinuing difference of opinion be-
tween manufacturers and the
O.P.A. about what constitutes
costs and reasonable profits. But
the major reason is the fact
that, since Congress has decreed
that the excess profits tax shall
be removed on Jan. 1, the man-
ufacturers are waiting for that
date to step up their business.
For every dollar that they make
REPEAL EXCESS PROFITS TAX
"before next year, Secretary Vin-
son will take 90 cents. Next
year he will take less. It is only
human that a manufacturer
who is sure of selling his com-
modities will hesitate to sell
them now. He will withhold
making them or store them for
sale later. There is less neces-
sity for ready money now,
because manufacturers have
plenty of wartime reserves.
If Congress could compre-
hend this fact and set the date
of the repeal of the excess prof-
its tax at an earlier date, pro-
duction and sales would immedi-
ately move ahead.
It is hard to see how such a
change of date would injure
anyone. In the business of mer-
chandising clothing, a lost sea-
son is almost a net loss, for peo-
ple simply make old clothes
serve. Not much accumulation
of demand takes place. A refusal
to take profits now deprives the
Treasury of all taxes, not only
the excess profits tax. Increased
production would produce more
jobs, absorb purchasing power
and make millions of consumers
happy.
The problem is sharpened by
the dearth of goods in prospect
for Christmas trade. Dollars not
spent between now and Christ-
mas will merely pile up and add
to inflation perils in other lines
later.
We are a nation with deplet-
ed wardrobes, with plenty of
money, with ample labor in the
clothing trades, with few prob-
lems of conversion in cotton
manufacturing. No real labor
difficulty is in the way. Congress
is the only impediment.
Here is a Christmas gift which
takes from no one and will make
everybody better off. Let's have
some action.
