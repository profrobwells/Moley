From my observations in and
around the sessions of the Re-
publican National Committee,
two distinct Impressions remain
-one favorable; the other un-
favorable.
The first impression comes
from the fact that committee
members, from Chairman Her-
bert Brownell down, are not in-
terested in 1918 candidates.
They see as their immediate job
the restoration of public confi-
dence in the Republican party
as the official opposition and, fol-
lowing that, the capture in 1946
of the House of Representatives
and possibly of the Senate.
THE GOAL SET
On the present basis of mem-
bership, 27 new seats in the
House and nine in the Senate
must be gained to achieve the
goal. Republicans will concen-
trate on what they call the "mar-
ginal seats," numbering 134 in
the House and 30 in the Senate.
The disposition to ignore 1948
until after the election in 1946
is wise. It is not easy to make
this decision, for the disposi-
tion of every amateur in poli-
tics is to speculate here and
now only on names of putative
Presidential candidates. Such
speculation is not only irrele-
vant but nonsensical.
When I was asked, for the
hundredth time, the familiar,
"Who do you think will get the
Republican nomination in 1948?"
I improvised this answer: "Can
you design the hat your wife
will be wearing on Easter Sun-
day, 1948?"
There is pertinence in the
comparison, because there is
style in candidates as there is
in hats. Political style is deter-
mined by many factors-the eco-
nomic weather, the international
outlook, the fading popularity
of older favorite personalities,
the many subtle and indefinable
currents in public opinion and
the character of the prospec-
tive candidate of the party in
power. Mr. Willkle won his
nomination because he seemed
to be a good opponent for the
inevitable Mr. Roosevelt.
MANY NEW FACES
The most important reason
why it is too early to think
about candidates is that nobody
can tell what personalities will
arise from the 1946 election.
There will be many new faces
in officialdom. Woodrow Wilson
and Judson Harmon emerged in
1910 and became contenders in
1012. No one would have sus-
pected in 1917 that Calvin Cool-
idge was even Vice-Presidential
material. Franklin Roosevelt
loomed up after his re-election
as Governor in 1930.
Figures other than Governors,
Mayors or Senators may appear.
The present popularity of great
generals may pass. A lowly fig-
ure from Army or Navy ranks
may emerge.
NO SPECULATION
In short, we can't even spec-
ulate now, for the materials for
speculation do not exist. And
so the Republican National Com-
mittee members refuse to spec-
ulate.
But another aspect of the Chi-
cago meeting was not so heart-
ening as the refusal to discuss
candidates. The Republican par-
ty's statement of principles fol-
lowed the routine line of po-
litical platforms. A series of
principles, however, does not
make a party philosophy.
THIRD WAY NEEDED
There is nothing in the state-
ment to answer the question in
many minds about whether the
Republican party is to be mere-
ly an opposition to all that Dem-
ocrats try to do or whether it
is to follow the New Deal, with
several reservations.
The point is that a Republican
philosophy can be created which
is neither an indorsement of a
modified New Deal nor a return
to utter and rugged individual-
ism. The Republican party must,
if it is to capture public support,
find a third way, and it has not
yet found it.
