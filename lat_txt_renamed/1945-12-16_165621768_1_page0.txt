SEARCH FOR SOLVENCY
The date is fast approaching
when the President must pre-
sent his annual budget to Con-
gress. Amid the gloomy appre-
hension which precedes that
ominous presentation of the cost
of government next year, there
are a few bright omens.
One of them is a clear reces-
sion in the strength of the spend-
ing-for-spending's-sake school in
Washington. Another is the
presence of a real statesman,
Sen. Walter F. George, as chair-
man of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. Another is the lively
interest and activity of local
economy organizations through-
out the United States.
SOLID WORK
Finally, there are cold figures
to support a hope that the na-
tional budget may come closer
to a balance than most people
anticipate.
No organization has been do-
ing more tireless and effective
work toward a solvent nation
than the Tax Foundation, which
has just celebrated its 10th birth-
day. The credit for the found-
ing and the building up of this
agency belongs to Lewis H.
Brown.
CONTINUOUS STUDIES
The foundation consists, in the
main, of a central research and
public information office in New
York, financed by voluntary con-
tributions. The staff of the
foundation has engaged in con-
tinuous studies of taxes and pub-
lic expenditures, which have not
only helped shape public opin-
ion, but which have been of real
service to hard-working commit-
tees of Congress which deal with
fiscal policies.
There is no suggestion of
partisanship in the foundation.
Two former Undersecretaries of
the Treasury who served in the
Roosevelt administration are
members of the foundation
board, one of whom, John W.
Hanes, is the newly elected pres-
ident of the foundation.
TECHNICAL HELP
The foundation has encour-
aged and given technical help to
36 State economy leagues or
committees. Each State organi-
zation is supported by the citi-
zens of the State concerned. It
works with State Legislatures,
City Councils and administrative
officials. Immense savings have
been achieved through the influ-
ence of these bodies. They are,
as is the Tax Foundation itself,
nonpolitical.
Mr. Hanes is also chairman of
the Citizens National Committee,
a group, independent of the Tax
Foundation, which co-operates
with official Washington and
which publishes useful informa-
tion about the financial prob-
lems of government.
WORTH NOTING
This whole effort toward
sound finance has certain char-
acteristics which are worth not-
ing in these days of internal con-
flicts. It has no enemies, for
everyone or nearly everyone
favors economy and lower taxes.
Union labor, management, farm-
ers, all can agree that there will
be more for everyone if govern-
ments cost less.
If a high level of production
is attained, there will be a high
level of employment, and the
burden of taxes will be lighter.
The encouragement given by a
balanced budget to people who
invest in production activities is
obvious to everyone.
THEY AGREE
It is also clear that the ideal
of all parties and factions is that
jobs should come through pri-
vate employment, not through
government doles or made-work.
Presidents Roosevelt and Tru-
man have both said that. And
even the now badly tattered full
employment bill asserts that
fact.
An unprecedented national
debt has given every American
the haunting fear that we shall
never find the way to solvency.
But with reasonable agreement
on all sides on a number of sim-
ple tax and spending principles,
we can, perhaps within a year,
carry the debt and pay for our
government without borrowing
more. The Tax Foundation is try-
ing to get the facts necessary to
such an agreement over to all
the people who, in the last
analysis, pay the bills.
