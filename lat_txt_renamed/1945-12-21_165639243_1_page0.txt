Lord Keynes, whatever opin
ion we may hold of his earlier
economic views, bravely faced
a tough ordeal before the House
of Lords in explaining the re-
sults of his financial mission.
The loan, he said, provides cer-
tainty for America and elasticity
for Britain. He was sorry, he
continued, and always would be
that he negotiated only a loan,
when he wanted a grant, "But,"
confessed the noble lord, "a
point comes in a matter of this
kind when one has to take 'no'
for an answer"
The "no" to which he referred
was offered with tact but inflex-
ible purpose by our Assistant
Secretary of State William L.
Clayton. Great credit goes to
this Texan for his skill and firm-
ness during the long negotia-
tions in Washington.
STRANGEST PART
The strangest part of it all is
the fact that it was Lord Keynes
himself, at Bretton Woods, who
thoroughly sold Americans the
idea of lending.
In a sense, Lord Keynes ex-
perienced what John Maynard
Keynes pointed out 25 years ago
in his description of Woodrow
Wilson's procedure at Versailles.
He said that when Mr. Wilson
began talking about a League of
Nations, he was not certain that
he could promote the idea. But
when Clemenceau and Lloyd
George cynically encouraged our
Idealistic President, because they
wanted not the League, but other
perquisites, they "sold" Mr. Wil-
son so thoroughly that, later on,
they found it impossible to "un-
sell" him.
INFLEXIBLE STREAK
There is a hard and inflexible
streak in the American char-
acter in international dealings.
Once convinced that our way to
save the world is holy, just and
necessary we will go to the end.
We are slow in starting, but we
finish with terrific force.
The Bretton Woods plan was
first suspected over here as a
means for tapping our Treasury
in behalf of foreign nations. But
we came around to it with such
unanimity and determination
that we are literally forcing it on
its creators.
CLOSE TO A GIFT
The loan accepted by a dubi-
ous House of Lords is certainly
as attractive as anything short
of a gift could be. No interest
at all for five years; after that,
2 per cent, which is the point de-
scribed by Lord Keynes as
"renters happy death."
Then, if in any year the Brit-
ish are not enjoying a standard
of living equal to that of prewar
years, there can be a "waiver"
and payment later. Dr. Ernest
Stern, writing in the London
Banker, expresses a doubt that
British exports may ever reach
expectations. The "waiver" may
assume great importance.
WHY SO GENEROUS?
Why did we make such a gen-
erous deal? In the first place,
American opinion, despite its oc-
casional anti-British sentiment,
thoroughly subscribes to the
view that we need a vital British
Empire. In many parts of the
world it is still the framework
into which can be built inter-
national arrangements in behalf
of liberty and civilization.
We have no good reason to be
jealous of brisk trade among the
parts of the empire. We know,
for example, that the British do-
minions will not get all they
need within the empire, and
that means markets for us.
BRITISH DOUBTS
In part, British doubts arise
from their feeling that we may
use pressure to destroy empire
preferences. Britons have a pro-
found conviction that these
agreements within the empire,
adopted over 13 years ago, really
rescued them from the depres-
sion. And they also harbor the
feeling that they did better in
getting out of that depression
than we did. Official Britain is
not saying it openly, but it feels
that Americans are not safe
guides in telling the world how
to avoid economic disaster, since
we did so poorly ourselves.
