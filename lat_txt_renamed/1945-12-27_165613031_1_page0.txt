ILLUSION OF UNITY
If mere compromise with a
principle is what is needed, It
might be argued that President
Truman has made a good case
for compromise in his message
on a single Army-Navy-Air de-
partment. The Army is given
the single Cabinet office which
it wanted. Air is made co-
ordinate, and thus air-minded
people are satisfied. And in the
merger or supply and intelli-
gence the Navy plan is followed.
But compromise in such mat-
ters is not enough. This is espe-
cially true with respect to the
provisions in the President's
message putting the Air Force
on a parity with the Navy and
the Army. Airships are instru-
ments are used to make an army
or a Navy more efficient. When
air power was new, it was neg-
lected by a hidebound Army and
Navy. And so, to emphasize its
importance, it was proposed to
make it an independent armed
service and give its head Cabi-
net rank. But air power isn't
neglected any more.
Both the Army and Navy have
made immense use of it. It is
embedded in the armed services.
There is no reason to recognize
its distinction from the arms
which use it. And President
Truman himself recognizes that
the Navy should retain its air
power. Why should what re-
mains of it be separated from
the Army and incorporated in a
separate establishment? Per-
haps to give the Army relatively
more influence in the new de-
partment of national defenseâ€”
two against one. This is not a
very convincing reason in an
essentially naval power like the
United States.
Another Truman proposal, ap-
parently included as a compro-
mise, is to have a single Chief
of Staff who shall be drawn
from each of the three armed
services in rotation, for terms of
two to three years. This again
gives the Army two whacks for
one. It also draws a professional
man from one of the services,
whose main job would be merely
to compose differences between
the services. And the compos-
ing of such differences should
not be the responsibility of a
professional, but of a civilian.
Most important of all is the
error of the assumption that a
new super-Cabinet officer can
be found who is, indeed, super-
person. The manner in which
Cabinets are chosen offers no
evidence favoring such an as-
sumption. Cabinet officers, espe-
cially at the beginning of an ad-
ministration, are chosen for
many reasons, few of which
have any bearing on the quality
of the man. Geography looms
large. North, East, South and
West must be "represented."
There are heads of big party
factions to be chosen, as was
Bryan, in Wilson's time. Polit-
ical debts are paid in Cabinet
jobs, and sometimes sheer
chance is involved. I have high
authority for the story that
when Woodrow Wilson chose
one of his secretaries he was
thinking of another man and by
mistake offered the job to a man
of the same name.
There certainly is no reason
for confidence, looking back at
the succession of War and Navy
secretaries who held office be-
tween the two last wars.
