The Cabinet Member Nobody Can Find
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The reiteration by President
Truman of his support of a single
department of defense is
preventing the continuation of
a fair debate on the subject between
Army and Navy leaders.
Navy people can hardly afford
to express their honest opinion
of how wrong-headed the arguments
of the Commander-in-
Chief really are. But no gag can
be imposed on members of Congress
or the press, and there
will be plenty of debate before
the Thomas bill gets through
Congress.
The revamped legislation positively
does not combine the Army
and Navy plans. What it
does is to set up the basic Army
plan and then decorate the
branches with a few trimmings
from the Navy plan. The essential
fallacy remains.
That fallacy is that a single
Secretary can be found by any
President, sufficiently experienced,
fair-minded and energetic
to head such a unified defense
department and to represent in
the Cabinet the interests and
point of view of the three services—Army, Navy and air. No
such paragon has served in any
Cabinet in recent times, perhaps
at any time.
Consider, for example, any or
all the War and Navy Secretaries
since Lincoln. In many
cases, the person chosen had
some familiarity with or sympathy
for the service he headed.
This certainly was true of
Knox and Stimson in this war.
In other cases, as with Newton
D. Baker and Elihu Root, men
without service background
were selected. But in such cases
the evidence is that their energies
were fully occupied in learning
the problems of their department
and that they needed plenty
of time to become effective
in solving those problems. The
present plan of unification would
require a Secretary of Defense
to learn three times as much
as Newton D. Baker or Elihu
Root had to learn.
Under the new plan, any interest
or experience in one of
the services would be not a
qualification but a disqualification.
The President would be
moved to select a neutral person—that is, one who knew
nothing of either service. That
would be the President’s test
of the probable fairness and
balance of his appointee.
It is silly to argue that a Cabinet
member need not learn the
details of his department. Those
who have seen the inside of a
new administration getting under
way can testify how rapidly
and how deeply a new Cabinet
member must dig into his department
in order properly to
represent it. He cannot delegate
this job of exploration to others.
He and he alone must know
enough to decide hundreds of
issues among his subordinates.
He must make his decisions as
an administrator, not as a judge,
which is an important distinction.
The Truman plan assumes
that a colossus can be found
who can master the equivalent
of three departments in the
time formerly required to master
one. And in the future, the
three departments—Navy, Army
and air—will be many times
larger than before the late war.
If we may judge from Mr. Truman’s
past appointments, he is
no discoverer of such supermen.
