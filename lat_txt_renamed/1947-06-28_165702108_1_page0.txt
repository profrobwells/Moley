Raymond Moley.
One of the most important
but unpublicized figures in the
Soviet government is Eugene
Varga. This economist, a native
of Hungary, went to Russia
with Lenin and Trotsky in 1917
aboard the famous "sealed"
train provided by Germany.
Since the revolution, he has
been a sort of brain truster for
the Russian rulers. He enjoys
special privileges and directs
much of the economic research
of the Soviet.
Whatever Varga says deserves
close attention. It is orthodox
Communist doctrine and often
anticipates the diplomatic posi-
tions of the government. As
long ago as 1943 he made a
statement on German repara-
tions which still corresponds
with Soviet policy. He first sug-
gested $10,000,000,000 and repara-
tions in manpower as Russia's
share. Molotov has tirelessly re-
peated the same figure.
All this underlines the impor-
tance of an article by Varga in
the current issue of Foreign Af-
fairs. Varga's subject is "Anglo-
American Rivalry and Partner-
ship." It is frankly labeled "a
Marxist view" and shows clear-
ly how completely Varga keeps
informed on American and Brit-
ish economic affairs. His article
A RUSSIAN LOOKS AT AMERICA
is full of references to the very
latest American economic re-
ports. It also reveals a fairly
good grasp of American politics.
The theme of the article is
the tremendous ascendancy
which the United States has
gained over England in the last
half century. Now, Varga says,
the greatly increased capacity of
American industry requires the
utmost in exports. Since Ger-
many, Japan and Italy are out
of the running and Europe can-
not buy except on credit, the
full force of our competition
will be directed against the Brit-
ish Empire. And thus "the ulti-
mate aim of American policy is
to break up the British Empire."
While this suggests that the
United States by deliberate in-
tent is going to break up the
British Empire, Varga probably
did not mean that. He meant
that, due to our great economic
superiority, we shall inevitably
break up the empire.
Varga then says that the
American necessity to export in
order to prevent unemployment
and stagnation compels the Unit-
ed States to pursue a policy of
imperialism. "Today," he says,
"the United States is the land
where militarism is most in
vogue. Big business is bent on
using the country's military
power for economic subjugation
of the world."
Varga pays high tribute to
Roosevelt as a statesman. But
since Roosevelt's death, he says,
"the forces of social reaction
have been gaining the upper
hand in the United States." This
"reaction," he continues, is "har-
boring the danger of Fascism."
Despite the growing difference
between the domestic policies of
Truman's America and Attlee's
England, the foreign policies of
the two countries are united.
Truman, says Varga, has broken
with the Roosevelt tradition.
Bevin is continuing that of
Churchill. Bevin, according to
this Soviet view, is able to get
away with this only because the
"social democracy" of Britain is
deeply opposed to Communism.
The agreement of Molotov to
confer in Paris with Bevin and
Bidault becomes more under-
standable in the light of the
Varga article. He is undoubtedly
talking over our heads at the
British Labor government. He
is warning them against Uncle
Sam. He would like to bring
Britain closer to Russia. No
doubt, Molotov also hopes to do
that at Paris.
