No Four-Year Plan
President Truman could have
saved some hundreds of words
arguing the principle of his
European recovery program.
Congress and the country have
granted that point. But the
practice suggested will receive
no general approval. The fact
is that the President in the
course of his message gave plenty
of reasons for Sen. Taft's
statement that E.R.P. should run
on a year-to-year basis.
The President frankly confessed
that nobody could possibly
predict the course of events
beyond July 1, 1949. Thus, his
total of $10,200,000,000 for the
three years ending July 1, 1952,
was sheer conjecture. No doubt
the President is right in trying
to assure Europe that we will
not suddenly drop the plan after
1949. Europe might well have
some misgiving if all we do is
to provide for the first year.
THE ELECTION AHEAD
Europeans know as well as
we do that a national election is
due in 1948 and that sharp
changes in policy may result.
What Europe must know is that
we intend to see this thing
through.
Perhaps the best plan for Congress
is to provide the necessary
funds for the first 15 months and
at the same time pledge itself
by a nonpartisan vote to continue
the plan from year to year
in such amounts and in such a
manner as changing circumstances
warrant.
There are great differences in
the prospects of the various
countries concerned. The creation
of a self-supporting, non-Soviet
Germany will undoubtedly
take much longer than four
years. British recovery should
be well on the way in two years,
and much less should be needed
by Britain after 1950.
France, unlike England, has
great potential capacity to feed
itself and to build a truly stable
economy. France ought to be
in a position to lend money of
its own in less than four years.
ITALY AND AUSTRIA
Italy's needs should be less
than the estimates. Austria
must bear a serious burden of
Communist pressure and, considering
its slim resources,
might need help as long as Germany.
Such great differences in needs
among the countries make exact
allocations impossible very far
in advance.
The difficulty of projecting estimates
far ahead is underlined
by the President's vagueness
about how E.R.P. is to be administered.
The eternal compromise
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
continues between the State Department's
responsibility and
that of the proposed administration
of the project. The suggestion
is made that, as the years
pass, the international monetary
fund will become more important
and that private lending will
increase. That, however, will
depend on the capacity of other
nations to contribute to the fund
and the suitability of European
opportunities for the investment
of private American capital.
DIFFERING TREATMENTS
In administering the grants,
there must, of necessity, be great
differences among the countries.
Germany will be almost wholly
our responsibility. We must determine
exactly where the money
goes and how it is spent down
to the last detail.
The great pride of England
forbids any sort of strict supervision
over the disposition of
our dollars there. We cannot
afford to let our distaste for the
present Socialist government
suggest any political interference.
If we attempt that, we
shall unite Tories and Socialists
against us. In France and Italy
we can be pretty realistic. In
Austria, Greece and Turkey we
shall have to be extremely alert.
Presumably, as the plan goes
to the appropriate committees
of Congress there will be more
elaboration of plans for administration.
For the Truman message
leaves unanswered most of
the vital practical questions.
