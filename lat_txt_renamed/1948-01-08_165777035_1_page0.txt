Europe's devastation in the
late war has often been com-
pared with that of the Thirty
Years' War three centuries ago.
But in one important respect,
the two calamities were very dif-
ferent. The Cambridge Modern
History tells us that in the Thir-
ty Years' War the population of
Central Europe fell from "over
16 to less than six millions."
The suffering of other parts of
Europe was less, but generally
the strain of war was accom-
panied by a decline of popula-
tion.
ONLY FRANCE LOSES
In the recent war Europe ac-
tually gained population. The
Paris report of 16 nations on
the Marshall plan says that
those countries gained 6 per
cent in total population from
1938 to 1947. Turkey's gain of
18 per cent was relatively the
greatest. The United Kingdom
gained 4 per cent; Switzerland,
7 per cent; Sweden, 11; Italy, 10.
France's steady loss, which had
been apparent for many years,
was retarded to only 2 per cent.
German figures are hard to
estimate because of wholesale
movements of population. But
in the western zones, where 43,-
000,000 lived before the war,
there are now 50,000,000. The
Russian zone, despite emigration
to the west, stands at 20,000,000
â€”its prewar figure.
GERMANS IN FRANCE
These increases in population
have been accompanied by a
fairly general return to some-
thing like full employment, ex-
cept in Italy. The Paris report
indicates that there are 2,500,000
unemployed in Italy.
France, on the other hand, has
a shortage of workers. But
France has no love for Italian
workers or soldiers. The French
would rather hold their German
prisoners, work them and marry
them in the hope that the
French population decline might
be checked. The German coal-
mining industry complains bit-
terly about a lack of manpower.
Before and during the war
Polish workers were used in
large numbers. Now those Poles
are gone, and there are not
enough Germans who are able to
work in the mines. The sug-
gestion that Italian labor be im-
ported has been vigorously re-
jected. It seems that nobody
wants the Italian surplus.
WHAT SCIENCE HAS DONE
The increase in population in
countries where the direct or in-
direct ravages of war fell heavily
is surprising. Perhaps our
pessimism about the futile ef-
forts of political agencies to
make adjustments among na-
tional claims and conclude peace
can be countered with the
thought that science has accom-
plished something besides in-
creased efficiency in killing.
It has enabled people to stay
alive, despite the drain of war.
A distinguished American neu-
rologist, just returned from a
tour of Europe and the Near
East, reports that in his field
clinics and other agencies for
treatment are moving ahead
with increased vigor and effec-
tiveness.
It is not science that has
failed. It is the art of political
and economic progress.
