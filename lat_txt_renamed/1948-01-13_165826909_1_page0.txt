Mass Production by a Ghost
In his many Washington
years, Charley Michelson un-
doubtedly wrote more speeches
for others than any person ever
spoke or wrote for himself.
New York World and as an of-
ficer of the Democratic National
Committee, he provided oratori-
cal pabulum for Senators, Con-
gressmen, Cabinet officers and
others. He contributed little or
nothing to the output of Presi-
dent Roosevelt, who had a spe-
cial technique of preparation
which Charley was too impa-
tient to learn. But almost every
big figure on the Democratic
side for a quarter of a century
at one time or another spoke
words banged out on the well-
worn Michelson typewriter.
In his spicy book, "The Ghost
Talks," Charley had little to say
about his trade, although it was
one of the most interesting po-
litical facts of our time. He took
it for granted, never tried to
analyze it or consider its ethics,
mechanics or principles. He just
knew there was an unlimited
demand for speeches, and he
gave all his energy to meeting
innumerable deadlines.
His output was so great that
he never bothered to tailor a
speech to fit the prospective
speaker. In fact, many of his
products were composed before
he knew who the speaker was
to be. Some occasion would pre-
sent itself, such as the opening
of Congress or a major speech
of a Republican leader. Charley
would dash off a speech, point-
ing with pride or viewing with
alarm. Then Farley or Flynn
or somebody else would be con-
sulted, and somebody would be
selected to deliver the product.
Sometimes the first selectee
would have another engage-
ment, and the speech would be
passed on to another victim. Oc-
casionally, the speaker would
not be selected until the very
hour of delivery and he would
have no time to look over his
oration before he started talk-
ing. As a result, many Michel-
son masterpieces would be de-
livered in stumbling and inco-
herent style.
All this did not bother Michel-
son. His calm acceptance of po-
litical realities at times ap-
proached complete cynicism.
Probably no one since Aristotle
so completely separated in his
mind the disciplines of politics
and ethics.
Since the standards of ethics
are largely determined by the
prevailing standards of the time,
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
there is nothing essentially
wrong in ghost writing or speak-
ing. It is almost generally done
and almost generally known to
the public. Some statesmen as-
sert that they write their own
speeches. Wendell Willkie plous-
ly asserted that he "rolled his
own," but he, as well as other
protestors, was copiously sup-
plied by obscure writers.
The number and variety of
speeches required by a modern
statesman or business leader re-
quire some sort of assistance.
In the case of Roosevelt, noth-
ing so crude as plain ghost writ-
ing was involved. His speeches
were developed by personal con-
ferences, and the most highly
skilled helpers sought to elicit
the content and style of the
speech from the man. The ma-
terial was carefully tailoredâ€”
written and rewritten many
times. In the end, the product
was a veritable part of the
speaker, and he delivered it as
if it had been wholly spontane-
ous.
But such perfection is not pos-
sible in mass production, and in
the spot occupied by Charley
Michelson mass production was
essential. Charley's fecundity
was infinite, and we shall not
see its like again.
