Architecture: Truman Renaissance
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As if we were not already sur-
feited with controversy, another
fight started in the holiday be-
fore Congress met again. Two
venerable American traditions
are at war-on one side, the
architectural integrity of the
White House; on the other, the
good old midwestern front porch.
Harry S. Truman, who looks and
acts like no breaker of traditions,
has rushed in where executive
angels have feared to tread.
rotent as is the belier that the
White House shall stand untar-
nished through the years, how-
ever, the' President has invoked
the spirit of an institution that
has been cherished in many
States for almost a century and
dedicated to talking age and
whispering lovers. A simple fire-
side chat addressed to those
whose early memories are shad-
owed by the gentle protection of
the front porch might sweep
away gathering opposition, how-
ever distinguished,
Millions of us remember it as
it protruded from the house
well into the front lawn. Its
columns and ceiling suggested
the protective arms of the forest
-rus in urbe. Up against its
strong railing, men rested their
tired, beslippered dogs of a sum-
mer evening. Up and down the
long shady street the neighbors
drifted from porch to porch, ex-
changing greetings.
The President makes his ges-
ture in the interest of privacy,
but the roots of the tradition in-
volved, a serious surrender of
privacy. For neighbors could in-
terpret the lives of neighbors by
observing front porch doings.,
After sickness, the porch pro-
vided a place of convalescence.
A family's social companions
could be known by watching the
people who moved out front after
supper. There young men who
came courting discussed matters
with the daughters of the house.
Young love gathered momentum
in the front porch swing. New
additions to the family were in-
carcerated by adding a little
fence across the entrance at the
top of the steps. Old age could
sit all day and watch the world
go by. And the dear departed
passed over the porch and down
the steps to another world.
The front porch had immense
political significance. It was
there that McKinley and Hard-
ing campaigned successfully for
the Presidency. But, unlike Tru-
man, they did not take their
porches to the White House.
What has the Commission of
Fine Arts to say in answer to
this imprisoned American soul
struggling for a reminder of hap-
pier days in Independence? The
spirit of beauty is on its side, to
be sure. The front porch was a
thing of comfort, not contour.
It obscured whatever architec-
tural virtues the house might
have. It permanently darkened
the parlor, whatever loss that
might have involved. The porch
is an interloper which had its
greatest vogue in the era of
greenbackism, whiskers and the
Johnstown flood. The cool aus-
terity of the White House be-
longs to a more graceful and
tasteful age. It reminds us that
there was 'beauty even before
Harry Truman was born.
The architectural opponents of
the President, moreover, have a
certain logic on their side. It is
the logic of the man who stopped
his watch so that it might be
correct twice a day. Architec-
ture may be music, but it is not
motion. An accepted standard of
taste must rest somewhere.
There is horror in the thought
that every President might drag
up a bit of his past and plaster
it on this national shrine.
Victor Hugo covered many
pages with his anger at departed
kings of France who built their
several caprices into the Cathe-
dral of Notre Dame. Consider
what might have happened if
Chester Arthur had insisted upon
additions planned by the design-
er of Tweed's Courthouse,
