Dewey and Eisenhower.
Three weeks ago It was report-
ed in this column that Thomas E.
Dewey was playing possum; that
he was permitting other candi-
dates to extend themselves in the
hope that there might be no con-
certed action to stop him. It may
be added now that this interpre-
tation has been verified since on
excellent authority.
Dewey's ultimate intentions
were a foregone conclusion. But
he conceived the wisest policy to
be qualified indifference. He has
not been exceedingly anxious.
He felt that an unseemly seram-
ble for the nomination might de-
stroy the value of the nomination
itself. It ought to be the part of
all candidates to see, first, that
nothing is done to endanger par-
ty success and then to seek the
opportunity to be the beneficiary
of that suocess.
Dewey's announcement was in-
evitable. Its timing was probably
set ahead by circumstances since
the first of the year. The Eisen-
hower movement is a fresh new
political phenomenon. It is at-
tracting people who like to fol-
low new styles. To be for Eisen-
hower is a sort of political new
look. Within a few blocks of
where this is written in New
York are two different alleged
Eisenhower headquarters. The
several general headquarters
have no general and no head.
The quarters presumably will
flow in later.
Dr. Gallup's poll indicates that
Eisenhower is now favored over
Truman in New York by more
people than favor Dewey over
Truman. Eisenhower move-
ments are springing up every-
where. Dewey may well have
been moved to give the green
light a few weeks earlier be-
cause of this development. He
now joins Taft, Stassen and War-
ren in making a bid for the nomi-
nation of his party. Like the
other candidates, Dewey has
served that party well by distin-
guished labors in government
and in politics.
With no disparagement to the
general, it must be added that
he has not so served the Republi-
can party. Whether he is a Re-
publican at all is an enigma
locked in a mystery. All we
know is that someone who has
never met Eisenhower has said
he is sure that Eisenhower is a
Republican.
It is only accurate to say that
the selection of a candidate is a
responsibility of party members
and leaders. If we believe in
parties, we must grant them the
right to select candidates. It is
the party that suffers from its
mistakes. Hence, the legitimacy
of the Stassen, Taft, Warren and
Dewey candidacies.
Gen. Eisenhower should decide
soon (a) whether he is a Re-
publican; (b) whether he is a
candidate. Then he must deter-
mine and tell the public who
among these Eisenhower boom-
ers are his approved and chosen
representatives. They are ob-
viously not unified. Nobody
knows whether any one head-
quarters knows the people in any
other headquarters. It is not
even clear whether all of these
people are Republicans.
A man of Eisenhower's as-
sured fame and stature should
not permit this situation to con-
tinue. You, a good citizen, might
want Eisenhower to be Presi-
dent. But what would you say
if an "I Want Ike" worker came
to your office asking for a con-
tribution? I suspect you would
first ask whether the general had
approved the movement. At this
moment, the answer would have
to be that the general had not.
Then you would probably ask,
"Who are you?" No doubt, some
of the current Eisenhower
"movements" are similar to one
which sought in 1942 to substi-
tute Wendell Willkie for Dewey
as candidate for Governor by
putting an ad in the personal
columns of New York papers.
Eisenhower cannot afford this
kind of candidacy, nor can the
party afford to be thus stam-
peded. Eisenhower is entitled to
be a candidate, but the suitable
way to conduct a candidacy is
through well-known, responsible
and experienced Republican lead-
ers.
Meanwhile, the Dewey candi-
dacy is better in the open. May
the best man be selected.
