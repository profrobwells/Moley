'Not Peace, Not War'.
John Foster Dulles points out
with great clarity the fact that
the more Americans can under-
stand the Soviet's policy of "not
peace, not war," the more ade-
quately we can prevent war.
This advice of Dulles, it would
seem, is a vastly more potent
means of preventing war than
either the bellicose boasting of
men like William C. Bullitt or
the banal braying of Henry Wal-
lace.
Dulles has seen more of Soviet
foreign policy than any of the
three Secretaries of State with
whom he has co-operated since
the war ended in Europe. He
has attended seven international
conferences with the Russians.
And he has now, after thinking
it all over, decided that Amer-
ican policy should also be "not
war."
It is difficult for Americans to
comprehend the "not peace, not
war" policy of the Soviet leaders.
We like to think of eras as our
history books describe them—
war followed by peace, followed
by war, and so forth. For Amer-
icans, war is a time for all-out
effort—the whole people fighting
as one. Our tradition of peace
is somnolent indifference to for-
eign danger, during which we
develop our country, make mon-
ey, enjoy ourselves and let our
Army and Navy rust away.
But we are not going to have
that kind of peace for many
years, perhaps not in this gen-
eration and certainly not while
the present regime of Commu-
nists rule Russia. That is be-
cause war talk without war is
vitally essential to the political
ascendency of Communism. And
that is why Vishinsky harped so
on "warmongering." That is
also why people over here who
talk about a preventive war are
playing into the hands of the
Soviet.
The Russian government rules
the army and is nationalistic.
The Communist party is inter-
nationalist and rules a far-flung
net of propaganda and sabotage.
It deals in discord. It thrives on
poverty and distress. And as it
can claim gains abroad, it gains
more severe power in Russia.
If Henry Wallace's dream of
friendship should be accepted by
Soviet leaders, the ground be-
neath them would disintegrate.
The dictatorship is retained on
the pretext that the capitalistic
world is a threat and that it is
warlike.
In the years immediately after
the first World War, belligerent
statesmen like Winston Church-
ill did much to intrench Stalin
and others like him in power.
For there were not only Church-
ill's hostile words, but shooting

attacks by Russians like Kolchak
and Denikin and by the Poles
under Pilsudski. The result was
Russian submission in the rule
of strange men, and the nation
put its nose into the Soviet hal-
ter.
Dulles spells out an alterna-
tive to both the mailed fist and
the limp hand of trust. The
Marshall Plan is only a prelude
and part of that alternative.
The Dulles policy would pro-
ceed on the assumption that war
is not probable and can be avoid-
ed, although he would pre-
sumably keep our armed serv-
ices strong. It would decry talk
of war on our side, because that
directly strengthens the Soviet
rulers in their own country. It
would keep up talking relations
with the Soviet at special con-
ferences, and at the United Na-
tions some useful agreements
can be found. But our course
should be deeds, not words. After
a while, Dulles believes, if we
frustrate penetration and sabo-
tage, the Soviet leaders may
abandon those tactics. Then, and
not until then, can real peace-
making begin.
This policy of resolutely ac-
cepting strife within a general
pattern of "no war" seems to
be our destiny, and Dulles has
stated it better than has anyone
else.
