The Lonas Are Back in Louisiana
They apparently made the
famous grave before the monu-
mental State House in Baton
Rouge too shallow to contain the
spirit of the great Kingfish.
Once more a Long is on the way
to the Governorship.
Earl K. Long, brother of the
late Huey, outdistanced his op-
ponents in the primary last
week by such a tremendous vote
that it is hard to see how he can
be stopped in the runoff pri-
mary on Feb. 24.
Earl has neither the violence
nor the smartness of Huey. His
chief assets are his name and a
dogged persistence. However,
his campaign was skillfully
handled, and on primary day
the parishes, from the cane-
brakes to the northern hills, re-
sponded as they did in the days
of the dictatorship. The Long
managers thought of every vote-
catching device developed in
their extensive experience.
It had been rumored that Earl
had broken with Huey. To com-
bat this alleged heresy, the Long
family was brought forth.
Huey's widow was induced to
speak on the radio. Huey's son
appeared with Earl. This young
man has some of the ability of
his father. He had a notable
college record, served in the war
and is a lawyer. Since a Gover-
nor cannot succeed himself, it is
believed the young man will be
the Long candidate in 1952.
Running against Earl Long
were Sam Houston Jones, for-
mer Governor; Judge Robert
Kennon and U.S. Rep. James H.
Morrison. They finished in that
order.
Jones will confront Long in
the runoff. But his chances
look dark. Long will retain his
own vote and probably get most
of the votes cast in the recent
primary for Morrison. Most of
the Kennon strength will prob-
ably go to Jones, but unless a
big stay-at-home vote turns up
Jones will again run behind.
The comeback of the Long
element in Louisiana politics is
a bitter blow for the thousands
of people who want good gov-
ernment in the State. It is also
a serious problem for the leaders

of business and civic progress in
New Orleans. This city, which
enjoyed a remarkable growth
during the war, has developed
immense plans for the develop-
ment of industry and foreign
trade.
Huey Long's harrying of busi-
ness and the bad advertising
which came from the scandals
were serious handicaps. It was
thought in 1940, when Jones was
elected on a reform ticket, that
the turn had come. This feel-
ing was strengthened in 1946
when the old machine was de-
feated in New Orleans and a re-
form Mayor, De Lesseps Morri-
son, was elected. A victory for
Long threatens business with
further attacks and it would se-
riously limit the capacity of
Mayor Morrison to carry out his
plans. The fact is that Long's
position dims the hope that
Mayor Morrison can be re-elect-
ed in 1950.
The backers of Jones are pre-
pared to conduct a powerful
and desperate campaign in the
runoff primary. The success of
this effort now seems doubtful.
