The Thomas Committee on
Un-American Activities now be-
gins a new phase of its work.
So far its major task has been
to bring to public attention the
nature of American Communism
and the extent to which it has
penetrated our life. The com-
mittee now proposes to consider
how to deal with Communism,
by law or by other means. A
number, of bills are under con-
sideration, and a series of wit-
nesses have been called who
will make further suggestions.
In general, two problems are
before the committee-problems
which call for quite different
types of remedial action.
The first is the Communist
party itself. Should it be barred
from primaries and elections?
Are there effective means of
achieving that end?
The second has to do with
organizations other than politi-
cal parties which deal in propa-
ganda and other forms of influ-
ence. What should or can be
done to protect the public inter-
est against alien and subversive
activities of this kind?
The question of outlawing the
Communist party raises a
strange legal paradox. The
courts have held that it is libel-
ous to call a man a Communist,
but the courts have generally
defeated legislative efforts to
outlaw the party. Thus the
Communists can and usually do
answer attacks by saying they
are under the protective arm of
the law.
A further paradox appears in
this connection.. Some of the
most violent opponents of Com-
munism are also violently op-
posed to any law excluding the
Communist party from the bal-
lot. Moreover, while Gallup
polls show that a great majority
of the American people want to
outlaw the Communist party,
the Legislatures seem powerless
to carry out this wish and in-
tent of the voters.
A part of the legal problem
is in the difficulty of framing
legislation which explicitly pro-
scribes Communism and does not
affect other small parties with
radical programs. It is also ex-
tremely difficult to provide proof
which the courts will accept.
The United States Supreme
Court, in the Schneiderman and
Bridges cases, set up require-
ments of proof which are almost
impossible to meet.
On the issue of legislation
compelling the disclosure of the
backers and supporters of propa-
gandist organizations, there will
be wide differences of opinion
Two New York lawyers who
have for years been prominent
in cases involving free speech
Arthur Garfield Hays and Mor-
ris Ernst, are in conflict over
this question. Ernst proposes
legislation to force disclosure of
support given to all organiza-
tions, whether radical or not
which carry on large propa-
ganda activities. Hays rests his
objection to this on his orthodox
liberal philosophy. Such legisla-
tion would be an unnecessary
restriction of free speech, he
contends.
The Thomas committee has
made important disclosures of
Communist activity. It has,
with occasional lapses of fair-
ness, made a genuine contribu-
tion in informing the public of
really dangerous elements in
our life. But all such disclosures
are likely to degenerate into an
indiscriminate Red hunt, unless
specific remedies are provided.
The danger in the present sit-
uation is not so much from Com-
munists. It arises in the possi-
bility that an aroused public
opinion will blast the innocent
as well as the guilty. The Thom-
as committee must now deter-
mine with great care exactly
what should be done about the
problem it has described.
