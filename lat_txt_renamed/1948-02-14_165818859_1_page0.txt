The economic consequences of
the new look of the grain situa-
tion are already appearing. The
political consequences cannot be
far behind.
Republican leaders in Con-
gress are unutterably relieved.
A month ago they were facing
the consequences of ignoring the
President's request for restora-
tion of controls. If they had per-
sisted in refusing to grant new
powers to the President and
prices had continued to rise, the
political outlook by April would
have been bad.
A wave of strikes would have
been inevitable, which would
have stripped the Taft-Hartley
Act of credit for greater indus-
trial peace. A tax cut would
have been attacked by Demo-
crats as fuel on the fire of infla-
tion. With high prices the major
worry of Americans, the sum-
mer and fall would ring with
Democratic denunciations of the
Republicans who destroyed the
O.P.A. and frustrated a hard-
pressed President's struggle for
the little man.
ON THE OTHER FOOT
Now, for the time being at
least, the shoe is on the other
foot. To change the figure, Re-
publican hopes, as well as a good
wheat crop, are growing under
the snow of a hard winter.
The great error of the Inter-
national Emergency Food Coun-
cil and of the administration in
estimating the world exportable
grain surplus at 29,000,000 tons
is now apparent to everyone.
Even the I.E.F.C. admits a sur-
plus of 32,000,000 tons, and the
real figure is probably nearer
34,000,000. The great bull mar-
ket in grains was clearly due to
the government's assurance that
the lower figure was correct.
The President's learned council
of economic advisers apparently
failed to advise the President in
time.
The speculators whom the
President called "wicked" are
either losing their shirts or are
bringing lower prices to the
housewife. And high on the
beach after the tide is the mem-
ory of the members of the ad-
ministration who themselves
sought an honest penny in the
market. The administration
which was denouncing high
prices is now rushing support
for prices.
CREDIT FOR TAFT
All the political possibilities
in this changed situation will be
eagerly exploited by Republi-
cans. And it may well be that,
among the Republican candi-
dates, Taft will gain most from
the change in conditions. His
various replies to the President
can be reviewed with credit.
The economic consequences
are bound to be far-reaching.
There is a chain reaction to such
a break which can hardly be
charted in advance, because so
much depends not upon mathe-
matics but on public psychology.
Both in the United States and
abroad, people are asking wheth-
er this is the beginning of a
great depression.
There is one consequence,
however, which applies to gov-
ernment and the respective
strategies of the parties. If
things continue to level off, even
short of a real recession, the
national income will come down.
This might well justify a con-
siderable revision of the estimat-
ed size of the Treasury surplus.
That means that Senate Repub-
licans must consider very seri-
ously the size of a tax-reduction
program.
It also means that, while our
dollars will buy more relief for
Europe, the total size of the
Marshall expenditures will be
considered with greater care.
This present decline does not,
of course, lessen Europe's need,
but it affects our total capacity
to meet that need.
