The Spellbinder Is Gone BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After poking around on the
blood-stained battlefield of the
Bronx, this reporter has made
several conclusions which are
somewhat at variance with ear-
lier news stories,
The nrst conclusion is that
voters did not love Wallace
more, but Truman less, In 1946
the Democratic victor, Ben Ra.
bin, received 30,316 votes. In the
special election last week, the
Democratic candidate, Karl
Propper, received 12,578. This is
a catastrophic showing of Demo.
cratic indifference. The district
is populous and one of the best
organized parts of Edward J.
Flynn's efficiently appointed
Bronx County. In 1944 the Dem-
ocrat received 103,000 yotes, or
85 per cent of the total. And it
must be noted that Flynn never
accepted the support of the mi-
nor parties. These figures repre-
sent straight Democratic votes.
It is true that the Republican
vote faded away, too-from 16,-
931 in 1946 to 1482 in 1948. But
the Republican party in the
Bronx is a phony. Its boss holds
a county job at the sufferance of
Flynn.
The Wallace-backed American
Labor party candidate was not
the beneficiary of the Demo-
cratic fade-out. In 1946 the A.L.P.
candidate received 24,249 votes.
This year the score of the victor,
Leo Isacson, fell off to 22,607.
When catastrophe comes to a
well-disciplined machine, the
finger of blame is first pointed
at the boss. Then the boss lam-
bastes the district leaders. Some.
times a few heads roll,
In this case the whole blame
cannot fall upon County Chair-
man Flynn. It is admitted that
his lieutenants seem to have
been afflicted with political gout,
induced, no doubt, by rich feed-
ing at the New Deal patronage
counter and by the sluggishness
which grows on continuous vic-
tory. In past years a Democrat
simply could not lose in the
Bronx.
This time even Flynn, who in
this reporter's book is the most
realistic and shrewd political
leader in these States, actually
expected to win, although by a
reduced majority. His informa-
tion from the lower hierarchy of
the machine indicated safe
weather for his candidate, Need-
less to say, he is greatly troubled
by what happened.
But what Flynn cannot say
publicly is that something is
happening in the big cities that
no patronage and no organiza-
tion discipline can stop. The
melting away of the Democratic
vote in this election is not even
in major part due to bugs in the
machine. Its basic cause is in
the fact that there is a silent
grave in Hyde Park and there is
only an uninspired and uninspir-
ing shadow of leadership in the
White House.
From time to time over the
last two years a suggestion has
appeared in this column that
President Truman cannot win,
for a reason he can do nothing
about. He can promise and he
can blame Republicans. He can
make friends with labor and
pacify farmers. But that inde-
finable elixir which inspired the
masses in our cities, that almost
fanatical zeal for F.D.R. which
sent masses thundering to the
polls, that loyalty which would
hear no wrong of Roosevelt is
gone. And nobody can do any-
thing about it. If, as is probable,
the Democratic vote in a dozen
cities goes down 10 or 15 per
cent, all the Republicans need
do is to hold their 1944 strength.
and they can win.
Flynn, after 26 years' experi.
ence as leader, calculates that
any machine, however efficient,
can deliver only about 10 to 12
per cent of the registered party
vote. The rest must be snared
by the personality or appeal of
the candidate. With Truman
running instead of Roosevelt,
that appeal is simply absent.
Palestine, civil rights, peace
with Russia, communistic activ-
ity-all had a part in the Bronx
vote. But the real trouble was
Roosevelt-deficiency.
