Loose talk attributed to Am-
bassador Lewis Douglas about
guarantees to Western Europe
reminds me of a bit of hitherto
unpublished Roosevelt history.
In 1934 and 1935, Huey Long
was undisputed dictator of Lou-
isiana. He also was a source of
a great worry to the man in the
White House. On one occasion,
in a conversation with two peo-
ple, Roosevelt discussed, tenta-
tively and speculatively, the
idea of using his power to re-
store to Louisiana the status of
a truly representative govern-
ment. This he suggested he
could do under Article IV, Sec-
tion 4 of the Constitution which
says, "The United States shall
guarantee to every State in this
Union a republican form of gov-
ernment."
One of those present at this
conversation, who was, inciden-
tally, later appointed to a very
high office, dissented sharply,
mainly on practical grounds.
Roosevelt made no public state-
ment on the question of inter-
vention, but he probably played
with the idea until the death of
Huey Long.
In those days there was no
doubt about the absence of real
republican government in Louisi-
ana. Long was ruler of the
State. Although he was a Sen-
ator of the United States, he sat
beside the Speaker in Louisiana
legislative sessions and ordered
the passage of laws. He sat in
the Governor's office at times
and ordered the official stooge
to enforce such laws. He openly
selected professors in the uni-
versity without consulting the
trustees or the president. He
was the whole show, and he was
backed by as tight and powerful
a machine as ever existed.
The difficulty in any action on
the constitutional provision
quoted above is, as Roosevelt's
friend suggested, to find a prac-
tical means of enforcement.
When can it be said that a State
ceases to be republican? What
if the people in open and free
elections hand over power to a
single party machine? What if
the forms of republican govern-
ment remain, but one man calls
the plays?
Can the President move in
with the Army? Must Congress
be consulted? The Constitution
says not Congress or the Presi-
dent, but the United States shall
guarantee republican govern-
ment.
Hitler kept the Weimar consti-
tution and reduced the Reichstag
to a rubber stamp. The Czecho-
slovak constitution still stands.
Finland is one of the most au-
thentic democracies in the world.
President Paasikivi will prob-
ably remain and will possibly
agree to Stalin's terms. But the
major decisions in the Finnish
government may be made in
Moscow.
What can we do about it?
What can we do if the heat is
next felt in Sweden, another au-
thentic democracy? It is true
that Douglas seems to be talking
about guarantees against inva-
sion. But Soviet policy requires
no armed invasion. It involves
the ascent to power of local Com-
munist parties, as in Czechoslo-
vakia and other satellite nations.
When we speak carelessly
about guarantees, we may be
raising hopes we cannot fulfill.
If we cannot enforce our own
Constitution regarding an Amer-
ican State, we should be slow
to talk about guarantees abroad.
