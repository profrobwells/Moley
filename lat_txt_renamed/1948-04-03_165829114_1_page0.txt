Eisenhower Again?___
The test of a reformer is his
capacity to sacrifice mere vic-
tory for his principles. Men like
the elder La Follette in the old
Progressive days stood firm for
their ideas, despite the fortunes
of elections.
Those who profess attachment
to the progressivism of the New
Deal are of a different breed.
Long tenure of power has made
them just another crop of job
holders. They want to win, re-
gardless of principle. They are
not looking for a candidate
whose views they share. They
want a candidate who can win.
Never mind Truman's real but
blundering support of all the
nostrums they were promoting
when Roosevelt died. Never
mind Truman's support of the
civil rights program that they
have been clamoring about. He
can't win, so he must be jetti-
soned.
The revival of the draft-Eisen-
hower movement is a choice
piece of hypocrisy. The two
Roosevelt boys know or ought
to know that they have no rea-
son to think Eisenhower be-
lieves in the so-called "objec-
tives" of their late father. Nor
do the members of the so-called
_ BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Liberal Party of New York,
headed by A. A. Berle Jr., the
most radical member of the 1932
brain trust, have any assurance
of Eisenhower's views. But they
want Eisenhower for no con-
ceivable reason except that he
stands high in the poll.
The desire of bosses like Jake
Arvey of Chicago for a winner
is more consistent. Bosses are
never bothered with radical
ideas. They never make any
pretense about their objective.
They live by winning elections.
Moreover, the southern lead-
ers who want to drop Truman
might well welcome Eisenhower.
In the main, their bent is con-
servative, and there is no reason
to believe Eisenhower is radical.
But the clamor for Eisenhower
is not a distinctive part of the
southern movement. The South
is willing to lose for the sake
of its convictions.
The draft-Eisenhower affair is
a strange movement born of des-
peration, not logic. Can anyone
believe that a sane man would
refuse an almost certain nomi-
nation on an almost certainly
successful ticket and then accept
nomination by a party that is
falling to pieces and facing de-
feat? Could a man, in Hamlet's
phrase, leave this far mountain
and batten on that moor?
There would be no assurance
that Eisenhower, popular as he
is, could win on a Democratic
ticket. He would be confronted
by many deadly questions. What
faction of the party would he
favor? The differences now are
irreconcilable. Would he pledge
himself to the uncompleted so-
cial program of Roosevelt and
Truman? How could he favor the
civil rights program, when sev-
eral pages of the report of the
President's committee are de-
voted to discrimination in the
Army of which he was head?
Of course, the Eisenhower
boomers are counting on turning
the whole campaign into a save-
the-world crusade. Eisenhower
would be suitable as a mask for
that appeal. It would enable New
Deal Democrats to cover all their
failures on the domestic front
with the cloak of patriotism. The
strategy of 1940 and 1944 would
be re-enacted.
Eisenhower has now made
clear that his answer to the Re-
publicans applies to all parties.
But busy New Dealers will still
try to discover hidden hope in
his words.
