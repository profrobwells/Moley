De Valera Is a Victim of Minorities
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The American visit of Eamon
De Valera should forcibly re-
mind us of the dangers we face
when we multiply political par-
ties. After years at the head of
Eire, De Valera failed to obtain
a clear majority in the Dail. He
has been succeeded by a gov-
ernment made up of a strange
conglomeration of splinter par-
ties whose only objective seems
to be to hold the reins of power.
The new government is sus-
tained by parties both to the
right and the left of De Valera.
Clearly, this patchwork govern-
ment can have little power in
dealing with England. Nor can
in constructively plan the eco-
nomic progress of the nation.
Such a weak government can
only muddle along until some
of its parties break away and
join De Valera; or, what is more
serious, a demagogue may come
along offering something re-
sembling Fascism.
Proportional representation is
blamed by De Valera's followers
for this situation. That form of
election was accepted largely
because Lloyd George favored
it and because many theorists
in Eire thought it to be the per-
fect means of attaining democ-
racy. This system is almost per-
fectly designed to prevent or
destroy two-party government
and to bring to the surface rep-
resentatives of every vagary
that seeks public attention. Un-
til the last election, De Valera's
party, the Fianna Fail, succeed-
ed in electing a majority of the
Dail, despite the presence of
seven or eight small groups.
This time he failed by a narrow
margin, and now the assorted
minorities prevail.
In the years between the
wars the multi-party cancer de-
stroyed most of the constitu-
tional governments of continen-
tal Europe. We now know the
dreadful result. Eire can go the
same way unless responsible
leaders in the larger parties
there recognize the danger and
agree to the rule of a party large
enough to represent the nation-
al will.
Those who assert that an ab-
solute majority is essential to
sustain a government argue for
something that is neither demo-
cratic nor orderly. Abraham Lin-
coln and Grover Cleveland and
Woodrow Wilson were minority
Presidents--Lincoln for one
term; Cleveland and Wilson for
both. In each case, the winner
lacked a majority of popular
votes. But the virtue of our oft-
denounced Electoral College is
that it prevented splinter par-
ties from playing havoc with
the final choice. This is the most
powerful argument, by the way,
against the abolition of the Elec-
toral College system of election.
Small parties seek control by
that sinister thing called a bal-
ance of power. This gives a few
dissidents power to frustrate
millions of regular party mem-
bers. Much of President Tru-
man's trouble lies in the use
made of this technique within
the Democratic Party by his
predecessor. Splinter minorities
were induced to vote for Roose-
velt because they were thus as-
sured of getting disproportion-
ate attention from the admin-
istration. Fifteen or twenty mil-
lion Democrats loyally voted for
their candidate, but it was the
additional five or ten million
that got all the gravy. That mar-
ginal vote is now following Wal-
lace.
When will people learn that
while we want small minorities
free to do as they choose, we
have a prior need to be gov-
erned by parties that are large
enough to assure stable govern-
ment?
