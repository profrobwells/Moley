Administering the ERP
Paul Hoffman answers the
call for a man to head the ERP
who has actually built things.
The appointment of a politician, a
diplomat, a theoretical economist
or a financier would have been
bad. Europe needs, above all, an
industrial repair job. Food, loans
to government and raw materi-
als are essential. But unless the
industrial machinery of Europe
gets back to the job of produc-
ing what its citizens need, our
loans and gifts are down the
drain.
Hoffman is regarded in busi-
ness circles as a bit of a radical,
an innovator and a sympathizer
with the more mild measures
of government regulation of
business. Hard-boiled Republi-
cans were talking about a more
conservative businessman for the
job. But Hoffman should be suf-
ficiently experienced and also
sufficiently flexible of mind to
meet a situation never before
faced.
It is clear in the plans drawn
up by the 16 nations at Paris
and by the President's commit-
tees that the practical needs of
industrial reconstruction were
not sufficiently stressed. The
best proof of this is the neglect
of provision for machine tools
in the program. Alexander G.
Bryant, president of the Nation-
al Machine Tool Builders' As-
sociation, has been insisting on
more recognition of machine
tools as a vital part of the pro-
gram. He points out that the 16-
nation report on requirements
was put together by economists
and politicians, rather than by
industrial people. Consequently,
in both of the reports of the
Paris conference, the term "ma-
chine tools" appeared only once.
It is pointed out that a con-
siderable part of the stuff we
should send should be equip-
ment capable of reproducing
itself. Put a group of machine
tools in a room, and they will
produce a litter of new machine

tools or other machinery. Put
any other tools in a room, and
they will produce only goods
for public consumption. Europe
must re-create the means of in-
ternal health and stability. This
is the lasting and hopeful part
of the ERP.
The ERP must do more than
channel loans and tools through
governments. It must, as Hoff-
man told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, follow
through to "the point of ulti-
mate use."
If goods and loans are fol-
lowed to their point of ultimate
use, private industry in Europe
will be involved. And that points
to the desirability of doing
what can be done to reactivate
that industry and to utilize as
far as possible experienced Eu-
ropean managers in private in-
dustry. In the long run, a re-
vival of capitalistic industry de-
pends upon private manage-
ment, not on governments, how-
ever sympathetic.
Loans made directly to pri-
vate concerns or groups of pri-
vate concerns should be safer
and more productive than loans
to governments, which rise and
fall with the political tide. Ex-
tensive visits of European man-
agers to the United States and
of American managers to Eu-
rope should be provided for
within the ERP. We must give
know-how, as well as money and
goods.
Barring an accidental war,
the real effects of the ERP
should be apparent before many
months,
