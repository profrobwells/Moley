Dark Horsemanship
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No one can know the infinite
variety of John L. Lewis and
doubt for a minute that he de-
cided to take Speaker Joe Mar-
tin out of the dark-horse stable
and show him to the country.
Things like a grand settlement
of the coal controversy in the
Speaker's office do not just hap-
pen. Lewis makes such deci-
sions with great care, and they
can very often be fitted into a
political pattern. It was that
way just before the election in
1946, when Lewis blasted at Sec-
retary Krug and when the Tru-
man administration was in the
throes of losing Congress.
A belief that it was Lewis, not
Martin, who was responsible for
the settlement is based on the
obvious circumstances. Lewis
was determined that Truman
would make no political come-
back by bringing the law down
upon him. Therefore, he decided
to give the credit for a settle-
ment to a Republican.
Among the various candidates
Martin was the most logical.
Dewey, several years ago, at-
tacked Lewis in connection with
his District 50 union. And, in
any event, this was no matter
for a Governor. Stassen is a pri-
vate citizen. Taft, as author of
the Taft-Hartley Act, is anath-
ema to Lewis. That eliminates
three candidates. Martin is the
highest ranking official, next to
the President. He is an agree-
able man, the kind Lewis loves.
A well-known Republican lead-
er, who favors Martin for the
nomination, left New York on
April 7 for Washington. He
planned to see Lewis. The set-
tlement took place last Satur-
day. There is good reason to
believe that this friend of Lewis
and Martin had a big hand in
the arrangements.
In any event, Martin now be-
comes a horse of another color.
He is not so dark as he was.
And his candidacy is formi-
dable. It is favored by the fact
that Stassen may, by conven-
tion time, move up to a delegate
strength which can, with Taft's
help, deadlock the convention.
In such a stalemate, delegates
are on their own. The politically
wise and well-known Repre-
sentatives and Senators who will
probably constitute nearly a
third of the convention will be
extremely powerful in a final
choice. And Martin is very pop-
ular in Congress.
Evidence of this is contained
in a poll of Republican House
members, taken last week.
Among the first choices of these
Congressmen, Taft leads, with
29; Dewey is next, with 25, and
Martin has 18. But in second
choices Martin is well in the
lead.
The interesting fact in this
poll is the relative weakness of
Vandenberg. He ranks sixth in
first choices and fourth in sec-
ond choices.
Martin might well be the bene-
ficiary in the convention of such
favorite-son delegations as Mas-
sachusetts, Pennsylvania and Il-
linois.
Moreover, in a convention in
which the prospects for victory
are bright, the possible weak-
ness of Martin as a campaigner
and as a constructive thinker
would be discounted. He is
known as a shrewd manager of
men, a fair-minded man, a loyal
party member and a nationally
known figure. His popularity
with John L. Lewis will hurt
among the fastidious. But the
nominee of a deadlocked con-
vention is not chosen with an
eye to the more critical voter.
Martin now becomes an impor-
tant factor in the race.
