More Bad Prophecies
The incurable power itch of
many New Dealers who are still
in office is shown in renewed
demands for controls, allocations
and the rest. This time the ex-
cuse is the defense program. In
November it was a coming food
shortage. The outcome of that
shortage threat deserves to be
recalled now, because the facts
in April mock the predictions of
November.
We were told then, not only
through official sources, but in
privately operated Washington
services, of a dire shortage of
meat in the spring and, of course,
of rocketing prices. Now live-
stock prices are lower than they
were after the discontinuation of
the OPA and much lower than
the black-market prices when
controls still prevailed.
We were given a great scare
last fall about grain shortages-
a scare which sent prices up
and which enriched many bull
speculators. Now we know that
we can expect more wheat than
the President's food committee
promised and still have a higher
carry-over than is needed.
The Cabinet food committee
first proposed, in September, to
export 470,000,000 bushels of
grain, of which 400,000,000 bush-
els should be wheat. This goal
was later increased by the Luck-
man committee by 100,000,000
bushels. The Department of Ag-
riculture doubted whether this
goal could be reached after Con-
gress had stipulated that the
carry-over on July 1 should be
150,000,000 bushels.
At this time we have either
exported or have on hand for
export 540,000,000 bushels, of
which 470,000,000 bushels are
wheat. The remaining amount
can easily be obtained without
greatly disturbing prices. And
after this commitment has been
carried out, we shall still have
a carry-over of more than the
150,000,000-bushel minimum.
But no one will be much con-
cerned about a carry-over in
face of the crop anticipated for
1948. The winter wheat crop has
been estimated at 861,000,000
bushels. If this is realized and
spring wheat runs into average
weather, we shall have a wheat
production of 1,130,000,000 bush-
els, which exceeds prewar aver-
ages by 250,000,000.
That should be more than
enough to meet export needs be-
cause the prospects abroad show
that we shall not have to export
more than 250,000,000 to 300,000,
000 bushels.

Nevertheless, the government
has recently stepped up its pur-
chases. This cannot be a reflec-
tion of anxiety about the supply.
It must be due to a desire to
raise prices.
The failure of meat prices to
rise as predicted is easy to un-
derstand. We shall have 8 per
cent less meat this year, but that
will be much more per capita
than before the war. And sup-
plies will be larger than the
slaughterings indicate because
of the large stocks which were
carried over Jan. 1. Add to that
consumer resistance in January
and February, when people be-
came conscious of higher prices.
Another minor factor is the
fact, shown in the report of the
President's Council of Economic
Advisers, that the purchasing
power of the public is lower
than it was last year. Conse-
quently the average American
family will consume less meat.
All this adds up to a fair infer-
ence that meat supply will be
adequate at least until fall.
The lesson to all this is that,
with a fair break from Mother
Nature, our old friends, supply
and demand, free prices and free
enterprise are much better regu-
lators than are our new friends,
the New Dealers.
