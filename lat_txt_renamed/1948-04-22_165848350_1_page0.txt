Guns or Butter.
Once again the old 1942 phrase,
"Guns or butter," is before us-
out with a different emphasis.
In those days we heard about
the shortage of supply; now we
will hear about a decline in pur-
chasing power.
A big armament building pro-
gram, such as seems essential as
long as war is a possibility, dif-
fers from a war in its effect on
our economy. War takes mil-
lions of producers into the serv-
ices and reduces the working
force. Those taken into the sery-
ices no longer compete for jobs
or for the pool of money flowing
into private hands from wages
and profits. They must be fed
and clothed, and the money for
that comes from borrowed
money and taxes. The food they
eat and the clothes they wear
come from the supplies avail-
able from production. Hence,
here is a larger supply of
money for those left at home,
but less stuff to buy in the mar-
kets.
In an armament building pro-
gram not so many producers are
taken into the services. Those
who would be taken under the
President's program would be
boys and young men who in the
main were not workers but
school and college boys. Arma-
ments, it is true, take large
amounts of steel and other types
of supply, but in the highly tech-
nical nature of postwar arma-
ment the quantities of material
required do not so heavily bear
on consumer goods.
Such a situation, therefore,
permits a continuous production
of consumer articles which may,
to a considerable degree, stabilize
prices. Food will be more plenti-
ful and probably cheaper. While
this will benefit some of us, it
will reduce farm income, despite
large purchases by ERP. All in
all economists see a decline in
purchasing power and in the
standard of living, despite arma-
ment building.
The President's Council of
Economic Advisers, in its most
recent report, warned of this
decline in reasonable terms. It
said: "Consumer purchasing
power today is less than at any
time since 1942 ... In the first
three months of 1948 the per
capita dollar income indicated
an annual rate of $1274 or $58
more than last year, but the
catch is that, while income went
up, prices went up even faster
in terms of what a dollar would
buy in the first half of 1947."
The burden of taxes still bears
heavily on the standard of living,
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
even after the recent tax cut. It
is still well beyond 25% of the
national income. When Fred
Vinson was Secretary of the
Treasury, he clearly told us that
a modern capitalistic economy
cannot in the long run maintain
a tax burden beyond 25% of the
national income without injury.
When it exceeds that rate the
standard of living must go down.
In the budget year 1947-1948
we are taking from our economy
about $48,000,000,000 for Federal
taxes and $12,000,000,000 for
State and local purposes. This
$60,000,000,000 exceeds the 25%
limit, for our national income,
however it is figured, cannot be
over $180,000,000,000 to $200,000,-
000,000. Thus, even with a tax
cut, we are beyond the limit.
Armament demands must add
$4,000,000,000 more to our bur-
den, and with an election coming
we can hardly expect cuts of
over $2,500,000,000 in other sec-
tions of the budget. Our national
production will hardly rise over
3%.
There is some rather cold com-
fort in all this, because Russia
will be in the same fix, and con-
sequently its own standard of
living must go down. But the
difference is that, while our peo-
ple may complain, Russians will
not be permitted to do so.
