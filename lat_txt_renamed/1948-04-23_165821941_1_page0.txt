Definitions of 'Liberalism'.
Last Sunday the New York
Times published six definitions
of "liberalism," by Messrs, Tru.
man, Wallace, Taft, Dewey,
Stassen and Warren, respec-
tively. Usually such statements,
when assembled, are a jumble
of meaningless words. Often the
philosophies of those who par-
ticipate are indistinguishable.
In this case something comes
through with great clarity, and
that something might well be a
hint of the real meaning of the
choice before the country this
year. The statements also show
the extent to which the term
"liberal" has been torn from its
original context and has been
used to define a program of state
action and state authority.
The underlying philosophies
of Warren, Stassen, Dewey and
Taft are substantially the same.
It is interesting that in each
case the word "individual" is
the center of the definition.
Taft, among other things, says:
"Every true liberal must
determine for himself which
so-called liberal program is lead-
ing in the direction of thought
and freedom of the individual."
Warren says: "Liberalism
is the political belief
that
important precious object of con-
sideration."
Stassen says liberalism is "the
maximum of individual freedom
for each man and woman con-
sistent with the enjoying of the
same degree of freedom by his
or her fellow men."
Dewey says liberalism "places
first the dignity of the indi-
vidual."
The similarity of thought is
obvious.
President Truman's definition
does not contain the word "in-
dividual." His is a program of
what "we" must do, presumably
for "us." He follows the familiar
New Deal line of starting with
what some unnamed "we," obvi-
ously meaning a government
manned by people like himself,
should do for people in the mass.
In Wallace's definition this
idea is projected still further.
Wallace, like Truman, does not
use the word "Individual." "Lib-
eralism," he says, "is the credo
of those who have no fear of the
idea of change." Thus, some-
thing must be done by somebody
for many somebodies. Who will
do it? "The majority." That is,
people in the mass. Who directs
this mass? Again the magic
word "we," presumably the self-
constituted elite which includes

Wallace. At the end of the Wal-
lace definition he frankly and
consciously throws out the tra-
ditional meaning of liberalism:
"One of the tenets of traditional
liberalism was opposition to gov-
ernment planning. But the pen-
dulum has swung since the Vie-
torian period..." Thus he dis-
cards the meaning of the term
and keeps the label to define
something else.
At this point it may be useful
to recall the meaning originally
given to the termâ€”a meaning
which gave the word "liberal-
ism" such acceptance and popu-
larity that it is now filched by
Messrs. Truman and Wallace to
cover the very thing it origi-
nally denied.
Liberalism, according to Guido
De Ruggiero in the Encyclope-
dia of Social Science, is based
upon a belief in "a free indi-
vidual conscious of his capacity
for unfettered development and
self-expression." This concept
can be clearly traced back
through Jefferson and Madison
to the very beginnings of Eng-
lish liberty. It is this, and not
what he sneeringly calls "Vic-
torianism," that Wallace wants
to lay aside. It is reassuring
that the four leaders named
above are of the honored tra-
dition.
