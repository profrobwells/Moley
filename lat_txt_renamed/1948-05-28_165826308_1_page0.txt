The odds against Harold Stas
sen in the last two weeks of the
primary fight were too great,
even for a campaigner of iron
nerves and endurance.
Those of us who were ring-
side observers in the final days
in Portland, Or., began to see
signs of weakness in the ex-Gov-
ernor's campaign. No candidate
in history has ever attempted so
difficult a job as Stassen has
faced over nearly two years.
And it is natural that mistakes
will accumulate as human
energy ebbs.
As the event proved, it was an
error to make a national issue
of outlawing the Communist
Party. In the writer's opinion,
any party advocating orthodox
Communism ought to be denied
a place on the ballot. But the
Federal government cannot do
that directly. The issue is, un-
der the Constitution, a matter
for the States. Hence, two candi-
dates for President were neglect-
ing some real issues in arguing
about the Communist Party. And
when the bate took place, Stas-
sen made the fatal error of re-
treating to the Mundt bill,
which does not outlaw the Com-
munist Party as such.
More important than this in
injuring Stassen was and is the
growing talk among supporters
of Vandenberg that the Minne-
sota man is not really running
for the Presidency, but for the
Vice-Presidency. Last year, on
a western trip Stassen stated
that under certain circumstances
he would accept the Vice-Presi-
dential nomination. At that time,
I was in Minneapolis and learned
at firsthand how the announce-
ment had taken the heart out of
some of his supporters. They
regarded it as a tactical mistake
of the first order.
Stassen has attempted to rec-
tify this error by naming cer-
tain people with whom he will
not run, such as Taft and Dewey.
But he has not excluded Vanden-
berg, and that is seriously in-
juring his chances. It enables
people to calculate that, since
Vandenberg is along in years
and not too vigorous, it is well
to have a young substitute stand-
ing by. Also, that since Vanden-
berg has let himself be reported
to be willing to be drafted for
only one term, it would permit
Stassen to go after the big job
in 1952, at the still youthful age
of 45.
This is all very nice in theory.
But it raises serious questions
and also weakens Stassen's drive
for the top job. In the first place,
it is extremely doubtful whether
the convention would nominate
a Vandenberg-Stassen slate. Mid-
western and western politicians
point out that since there are
two distinct philosophies in for-
eign affairs in the Republican
Party, the convention would be
likely to appease both, rather
than one.
Another, even more important
factor is involved. The responsi-
bility for executive government
falls upon the President. The
Vice-President, until the dread
moment when he becomes act-
ing President, is a legislative of-
ficer. Attempts by Roosevelt to
use Henry Wallace in adminis-
trative work caused unending
trouble. As head of the Bureau
of Economic Warfare, Wallace
ran afoul of the jealousies and
prerogatives of Cabinet officers
like Hull and Jones. The result
was to put Wallace back on the
rostrum in the Senate. There
can be no fifth wheels around
the executive department. The
President and the President
alone can direct administration.
Stassen would be well advised
to aim high and continue to aim
high, regardless of consequences.
Those who ask for half a loaf in
politics usually end up with
nothing.
