Mr. Truman's second wind,
which is a vulgar way of de-
scribing the lift of his popularity
after his dark days in 1946, paral-
leled the big grain inflation of
late 1947.
Now he is again acclaimed, and
Dr. Gallup says he is almost back
to his record. Politicians, being
devout students of history and
being supersensitive to real or
apparent aids to popularity, may
feel that Truman's limp spin-
naker may again be opened by a
late summer breeze of inflation.
The President and his official
associates have several means of
producing another lift. And those
who watch business and political
trends may well take note of
officially promoted rises in the
months ahead.
Grain prices, due to good crop
prospects here and abroad, are
easing downward. The govern-
ment has already bought all it
needs for export until June 30,
but it is aggressively buying for
export in July. If it wished to
save money and lose Truman, it
might wait a while, because more
and more of the old wheat crop is
now coming from the Southwest.
But in view of threats to give
the President the sack and draft
Eisenhower, something must be
done now.
It would seem, since European
crops are so promising, that it
might be well to revise some of
the quotas. But it can be taken
for granted that the government
will buy and buy to keep prices
high from July to November.
Germany and Japan can always
use more, of course.
An inflationary-minded govern-
ment can always encourage wage
increases, but the natural law is
already operating against that
stimulant. It is a solemn eco-
nomic truth that every wage in-
crease is inflationary except the
last one. The last one is defla-
tionary because buyers' resist-
ance ultimately prevails. Labor
leaders know that and they are
now warily anticipating the end
of their wage victories. They
were deceived by the Truman
administration's dire predictions
of a meat shortage, and they
launched the packers' strike.
That ran into bad economic
weather and failed. The Buick
strike vote went against the
union leaders, and now there is
the GM settlement.
There is trouble in textiles,
where prices are going down and
sales volume is smaller than was
anticipated.
Pipe lines are filling up in
many other consumers' lines, and
thus the arguments for pay rises
are getting weaker day by day.
There are vulnerable places,
however, where the public is
powerless to resist higher prices.
There the government has more
authority. The railroads through
their fact-finding board will prob-
ably agree on wage increases far
greater than those granted by
the meat packers. The same rule
may well apply to other carriers.
Higher fares and freight rates
follow, of course, and the pub-
lic must pay.
In such soft spots where pub-
lic utilities are involved and gov-
ernment is paramount, there is
hope for those who wish infla-
tion. But the hope that the Pres-
ident may be re-elected on such
a basis is not bright.
