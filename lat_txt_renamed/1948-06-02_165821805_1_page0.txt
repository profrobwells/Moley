Hunting the Farm Vote BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The hunting season for the
farm vote is now open. The
method in this old political
game consists entirely in mak-
ing promises. In this respect,
the political technique in ap-
pealing to farmers differs from
that adopted in pursuing labor
or business votes. If a candidate
promises higher wages, employ-
ers are antagonized. If higher
profits are promised, labor wan-
ders away.
In most years it is easy to
promise higher prices to farm-
ers, because the impact is dif-
fused and does not directly fall
anywhere. This year, however,
every consumer is highly sensi-
tive to food prices. Thus, the
promise of higher farm income
must somehow be coupled with
some ingenious plan to saddle
the government with the cost.
The various Presidential candi-
dates are having trouble find-
ing ways to make bricks with-
out straw.
Henry. Wallace is, of course,
little concerned with the farm
vote this year. His appeal is to
workers and other city dwellers.
However, his proposal to in-
crease ERP payments to $50,-
000,000,000 raises farm hopes.
His notion of an ever-normal
granary for all nations is pre-
sumably not a political argu-
ment at all but a bit of personal
fancy.
Sen. Taft, in his usual honest
fashion, has stated the truth that
the parity formula will have to
be revised. This has been inter-
preted as a suggestion of a
downward revision, and it has
hurt him in primaries but has
increased his stature as a states-
man.
Taft has had to follow Dewey
in promising a continued sup-
port of farm prices. To do
otherwise, would be to com-
mit political suicide. Both Taft
and Dewey follow the bills draft-
ed by the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which are revisions
Whales and War
Chicago Daily News
War and peace made a whale
of a difference to whales.
The whale oil industry is now
mainly carried on for making
margarine consumed in Europe.
A survey reveals that World
War II was a grand and glori-
ous vacation, or closed season,
for the marine monsters. In the
1939-1940 season 37,379 whales
were captured and reduced to
oil. By the 1944-1945 season the
number taken was down 4842.
Men were preoccupied killing
each other.
The prewar slaughter had al-
ready reached the point where
the herds were being slowly ex-
terminated despite international
whaling controls. Rapid recon-
struction of the whaling fleets
since the war has already led to
annual killing in excess of the
international control limits. But
results were disappointing from
the standpoint of oil in the first
postwar year.
Postwar shortages hit the
whales, too. Bad weather made
whale food scarce and whales
lean.
Whales are fatter now. As
their preservation is peculiarly
an international job, U.N. will
probably have to try to prevent
their extinction; that is, if U.N.
succeeds in preventing the ex-
tinction of men.
of Sen. Aiken's plan. That plan
is to continue price support for
a year and a half and to make
price support more flexible. It
also proposes an extended soil
conservation policy.
Stassen has sought to make
his promise more attractive by
including farm labor in the de-
termination of parity prices.
This would lift parity prices con-
siderably, especially if farmers
could include not only wages
paid out, but the equivalent of
wages for their own and their
families' labor.
President Truman, of course,
is in a position to make promises
more immediately effective. The
administration has already
promised to deliver wheat for
export at a lower price than our
present support price. The new
support price is approximately
$2.25 a bushel. The international
wheat agreement, which will
probably pass the Senate before
recess, envisages an export price
of $1.50 to $2 a bushel for 1948-
49, decreasing in succeeding
years to a minimum of $1.10 to
$1.50, This means heavy sub-
sidies which will be secreted
in the ERP billions.
The trouble with the admin-
istration program is that our
chances for food exports are de-
creasing because of larger crops
abroad. If the international
wheat agreement remains over
the next few years we may have
no wheat problem. But sur-
pluses of other commodities are
due, if support prices remain
high. None of the candidates
have anything to say about this
possibility. Presumably, they
hope that election may be over
before the emergency ripens.
