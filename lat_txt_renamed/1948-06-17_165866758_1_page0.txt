PARITY FOR LABOR.
One of the most durable meas-
ures of farm prosperity is the
parity formula. Briefly stated,
it is a statistical ratio between
what the farmer pays for the
things he buys and what he gets
for the things he raises.
Party, or 100%, is reached
when relative prices are equal
to the average of the five years
before the first World War. It
is assumed that those years were
good ones for the farmer and
everyone concerned. Despite
some defects and the need for
periodical revision, it has been
one of the most successful of
statistical formulas.
The General Motors formula
for settling its latest dispute
with the automobile union is
clearly an attempt to create a
parity formula for labor. The
question will be whether the
two statistical situations are
really comparable.
The General Motors employees
get a sort of guarantee that their
standard of living will be kept
at the 1910 level. If the cost of
living goes up, wages will in-
crease by a corresponding per-
centage. Should it go down,
wages will be reduced, but not
below a level of $1.56 during the
next two years.
ing efficiency in the industry. It
is assumed that efficiency in na-
tional production will go up 2%
a year and that a corresponding
wage increase of 3 cents an hour
will be added this year and next.
Many observers have greeted
the whole scheme with raised
eyebrows. They say that the
plan offers a guarantee that
since wages are the most impor-
tant element in determining
prices the whole system, if ap-
plied generally, would only pro-
vide for indefinite inflation. That,
however, remains to be seen.
The idea is not new. Sliding-
scale wages were tried almost
a century ago in England. At
that time the prices of food-
stuffs, principally grain, were
used to determine increases in
wages. In fact, over the years
the cost of living has always
been a factor in labor disputes.
It is true that the General
Motors formula makes it exceed-
ingly improbable that wages will
go down during the period of
the contract. It is always diffi-
cult to get the rate of wages
down in unionized business
lines. When the business cycle
turns down, wages in nonunion-
ized lines decline, but in union-

ized lines unemployment goes
up. In many foreign countries
the answer to the rigidity of
nominal wages is a reduction in
money values. This brings about
higher prices without raising
nominal wages.
The General Motors agree-
ment points to a crying need
in the Department of Labor. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics has
a passable but far from perfect
measurement of the cost of liv-
ing. But it has no general meas-
urement of national labor pro-
ductivity. There have been nu-
merous meetings of statisticians
to devise such a measure, but
not much has been accom-
plished.
Now, since the GM plan gives
more pay for increased produc-
tive efficiency, there is need for
a measure of that factor. The
figures of 2% and 3 cents an
hour are a very general and
tentative yardstick. In some
lines efficiency has increased
2% or more. In a few others it
has declined. It is difficult to
tell to what extent, if at all, it
has increased since 1911 in the
auto industry.
A good deal of figuring needs
to be done before labor parity
can be favorably compared with
farm parity.
