Old-Fashioned
Bosses Missing
From Convention
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
PHILADELPHIA, June 25â€”
No doubt if anyone could think
up another way of nominating
Presidential candidates it would
have been tried long ago. For
the national convention is the
most criticized and most inefficient
of American political institutions.
The recent show
here, however, demonstrated
how sensible men can get good
results with bad machinery.
Out of the pandemonium that
prevailed in the Quaker City
emerged a candidate who was
undoubtedly the choice of most
Republican voters and a platform
that fairly represents the
thinking of many millions of
Americans.
In Only Five States
The Presidential preference
primary, which idealists 40 years
ago believed to be a way of
making nominations more democratic,
has utterly failed. Real
primary contests took place in
only five States. In all other
States, delegates chosen in all
sorts of ways were in the main
uninstructed. They were foot-
loose and free. They were far
from being super men and women.
They represented the run of
the mill.
They worked under great difficulties.
Hotels and streets were
crowded. Communication was
chaotic. The convention sessions
were in unbelievable disorder.
Rumors were so thick that nobody
knew what to believe. And
for months supposedly expert
writers were saying a deadlock
was inevitable. But common
sense won out. There was no
deadlock. No smoke-filled room.
No dark horse. No apparent corruption.
No loss of self control.
And there were no bosses in
the traditional sense of the
word. True, some people had
more influence than others. And
some thought they had more influence
than they actually had.
In one notable instance a self-
styled boss, without consultation,
tried to commit his State,
and all he accomplished was a
net loss to himself and his own
State.
In many States, like New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, efforts
to swing large blocks of votes
here and there were frustrated
by the preferences and determination
of the delegates themselves.
The old-fashioned boss,
like Penrose, Hanna or Platt
is for the moment conspicuous
by his absence. The average
delegate was the kingmaker this
time.
Speeches Too Long
This is not to say that efforts
should not be made to improve
the operation of the convention
system. The radio and television
are exposing to the public at
large more and more of the glaring
defects of the institution.
Speeches were too long and too
numerous. There was too much
horseplay. There was little
chance of rational deliberation.
There were too many delegates.
A convention with 300 delegates
could do a better job. This
reduction in size would tend to
more orderly proceedings. It
would be easier to check and
to follow. But this time, this
American monstrosity defied all
the dire predictions of its critics.
