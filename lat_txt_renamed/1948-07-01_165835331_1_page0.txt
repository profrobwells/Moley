DEWEY AND ROOSEVELT.
This writer has had the some-
what unusual privilege of work-
ing with both Roosevelt and
Dewey in more than one politi-
cal campaign. Their methods
suggest many comparisons which
reveal some distinct similarities
and more dissimilarities.
It is clear that Dewey, if elect-
ed, will, like Roosevelt, be a
strong and positive political
leader. Time will tell how well
Dewey will succeed, but there
can be no doubt that he will
bring to the job methods and
qualities which will occupy the
interest of political students for
years to come.
It should be noted that I am
describing them here solely as
political managers, not as mak-
ers of government policies or
party ideology.
Roosevelt was always more
concerned with political organ-
ization than with ideas and poli-
cies. He was an activist. He
loved people, especially political
people. He largely delegated the
preliminary formulation of poli-
cies to others, and when those
policies were brought in, he
judged them on a political back-
ground. Was this the time to
advocate this or that? What
effect would this or that have
on the campaign?
He was quick to grasp an idea
and excellent in his power of
analysis. Moreover, when he ac-
cepted a policy, he knew how
to dramatize it. But all through
the years, especially during the
years before he was Governor
of New York, he spent much
more time in establishing and
securing contacts throughout
the country than in studying
economic and social problems.
And in his campaigns he care-
fully directed every move of his
political managers.
Dewey, too, is like that. His
managers — Jaeckle, Brownell,
Sprague and Lockwood —are of
his own choosing. He spends
hours with them discussing
strategy, and the final decision
is always Dewey's. He lacks the
personal warmth and liking for
people in politics which distin-
guished Roosevelt, but he is a
better and quicker judge of their
character and motives.
He has a capacity for driving
questions at a man that is often
mistaken for hostility. This
method is not meant to offend.
-.By Raymond Moley
It springs from a genuine desire
to get the right answers. He will
knock down a proposition with
seeming finality, but only for
the purpose of making the pro-
poser give better reasons.
His intimates know this and
literally dig to the marrow of
their brains to defend what they
propose. When the decision is
made, Dewey therefore has the
best possible reasons for mak-
ing it and the best means of de-
fending it.
Dewey is a harder worker than
was Roosevelt. He relaxes less
and cannot so easily turn to di-
version. He has few hobbies.
His mind is vastly more organ-
ized than was Roosevelt's. The
great generalities of Roosevelt,
which were never spelled out,
would have been carefully ap-
praised word for word by Dewey.
They would have been more
accurately phrased, but perhaps
not so seductively.
The new National Chairman,
Hugh D. Scott Jr., is going to
find not only that he is going
to work harder than he ever
dreamed he would, but that
somebody else will be a real
chairman of the board. That will
be Dewey himself.
