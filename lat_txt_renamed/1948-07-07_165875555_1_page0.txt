DEWEY'S BIGGEST PROBLEM
By Raymond Moley
With characteristic vigor Can-
didate Dewey has attacked the
first and probably the biggest
problem of his campaign. After
consultation with John Foster
Dulles, 1944 liaison with Roose-
velt's State Department, Dewey
has announced what parts of
foreign policy he proposes to
debate with his opponent and
what parts he regards as ruled
out by the bipartisan policy.
The ERP in principle, he says,
will not be subject to attack
since it conforms generally to
the views he and other Repub-
lican leaders had expressed be-
fore it was announced. The
United Nations and our part in
it are also out as an issue, since
Dulles has been active in it and
Warren Austin, a Republican,
is American member of the Se-
curity Council.
VULNERABLE POINTS
That leaves plenty of room
to attack Truman on other
phases of foreign policy in
which there was no real col-
laboration.
Ticklish questions are always
raised when foreign policy is
an issue in a Presidential cam-
paign. There is the old saw about
politics stopping at the water's
edge. And in this instance there
is the question of how much
joint responsibility has been
created by the bipartisan pol-
icy.
Two phases of limited collabo-
ration will probably face Dewey
and Truman. The first is the
four months of campaigning be-
fore election. The second is the
11 weeks between election and
inauguration, if Dewey is elect-
ed.
In the latter period, much
will depend upon the state of
our relations with Russia at
that time. Presumably, Truman
will, if defeated, offer Dewey
every means of acquainting him-
self with what is going on in
the State Department. Hoover
offered that sort of aid to Roose-
velt in 1932-33, with rather in-
different results due to the re-
luctance of the President-elect
to give any real help in return.
But it would be a great mis-
fortune if, in the campaign now
opening, foreign policy does not
get a complete airing. What is
going on in our affairs abroad
has a profound relationship to
domestic policies. The billions
going into ERP have a direct
influence on the budget, on
prices and on supplies of essen-
tial materials. That is also true
of the money spent on arma-
ments.
FEAR OF INFLATION
Dewey should, moreover, be
free to attack any effort by his
opponents to overstress a war
scare for the purpose of sug-
gesting that horses should not
be changed, etc. It is already
clear that the administration
will seek to promote the fear
of inflation for the purpose of
blaming Republicans in Con-
gress for failing to enact Tru-
man's 1947 program. Since pro-
moting the fear of inflation is
a cause of real inflation, that
would be playing politics with
the national welfare and it
should be so characterized by
Dewey and other speakers.
In carrying on a vigorous at-
tack on the Democratic conduct
of foreign affairs, Dewey and
Warren will be in a better posi-
tion than almost any other can-
didates who could have been
chosen. Vandenberg would have
been hampered by his record in
the Senate and by the fact that
he is still chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee. To
a much lesser degree, Taft
would have been limited, al-
though he might have done bet-
ter than Dewey in debating do-
mestic policy.
The country can well profit
by a real debate on what has
been going on in our foreign re-
lations.
