Barkley Stirs
Memories as He
Gives Keynote
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
PHILADELPHIA, July 13-
For a long time on Monday
night it looked as if the one
visible being around whom this
discordant, and distracted gath-
ering might find unity would
himself melt away into the ele-
ments from which he came.
Standing before the crowd in
the glare and heat of the lights,
with perspiration streaming
down his face, roaring forth a
recital of Republican sins and
Democratic virtues, interrupted
by the bellows and brays of the
multitude-it seemed as if this
elderly statesman would never
survive the ordeal.
Such an end would have been
a party tragedy, for without
Alben W. Barkley this conven-
tion would utterly disintegrate.
Seasoned Keynoter
But Barkley is a seasoned
keynoter and a traditional mod-
erator of immoderate Democrats.
As he stood there, memories of
his keynotes in 1932 and 1936
came to mind, as well as mem-
ories of his dignified direction
of an undignified convention in
1940.
In 1932 there was Hoover to
castigate and Grundy to ridi-
cule. In 1948 Hoover was un-
mentioned, but the durable
Grundy was food for another
joke or two.
A lot of history has passed
through and around the Ken-
tucky Senator since he came
from Paducah to Washington
35 years ago. He has earned
his place as a Senators' Senator,
well liked by colleagues of all
parties.
For a time during the first
Roosevelt years speculation cen-
tered around Barkley as a pos-
sible nominee in 1940. When, aft-
er the death of Joe Robinson,
the Democratic Party in the Sen-
ate fought over the succession,
Barkley was chosen and ulti-
mately brought his colleagues to-
gether.
Had Earned Bid
Finally, in 1944, it seemed that
justice and expediency called for
him as Vice-Presidential nom-
inee. Certainly he had earned
it and certainly his talents were
greater than those of the Sen-
ator from Missouri. But the
bosses prevailed upon an in-
different President to pass over
Barkley.
Only once was this loyal sup-
porter of F.D.R. stung into re-
bellion. When his labors in win-
ning unity on a tax bill were
flouted by the President in 1945
he resigned his leadership, but
was immediately reinstated by
his colleagues.
Now he says about all that can
be said for a declining party. He
elicits enthusiasm by recalling
better days. He strikes Repub-
licans in their most vulnerable
spots. He raises the red flag of
apprehension by pointing to the
Grundys and other reactionaries
around the corner. And far be-
yond the efforts of the platform
writers he puts in words-most-
ly Jefferson's words-a compro-
mise on civil rights.
The ovation that Barkley re-
ceived was not a mere hysterical
reaction to his oratory. It came
from a realization by North and
South that there is a Barkley.
It is to be hoped that during
that demonstration the bosses
who decreed that Truman and
not Barkley should succeed
Roosevelt struck their breasts in
self-reproach. For had they
chosen otherwise, the Democratic
Party might never have reached
this low estate.
