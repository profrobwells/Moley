RAYMOND MOLEY:
Record Indicates Dewey
as 'a Strong President'
The expression, "a strong
President" is used in academic
discussion of government not
to indicate Virtue, goodness or
even success in the office.
It is used to distinguish those
Presidents who do not merely
confine themselves to admin-
istration, but who use the office
as a means of influencing Con-
gress and public opinion gen-
erally.
Dewey will, if elected, cer-
tainly belong among the
"strong" Presidents. This is not
to say that he will succeed or
that he will be wise. Time alone
will answer that question.
A 'NATIONAL VOICE'
But he will vigorously exer-
cise his great power, offer
leadership to Congress, influ-
ence public opinion and, in
Wilson's phrase, become a "na-
tional voice."
Dewey's administration of
the District Attorney's office
revealed a tendency to inno-
vate, to appeal to public opin-
ion and to attack vigorously
many vested interests which
had been undisturbed through
the administrations of many
predecessors.
As Governor, Dewey has ex-
hibited the same traits. It is true
that he has since his candidacy
in 1944 refrained from telling
his party in Congress and in
the country what to do. For
that restraint he has been criti-
cized. But in New York he has
unhesitatingly accepted leader-
ship. He has, without offense,
let people know who is Gover-
nor. He has dominated his po-
litical captains and generals.
He has tactfully moved his
Legislatures to pass many new
and original pieces of legisla-
tion. He has put new blood and
methods into his State Depart-
ment.
LEHMAN'S CONTRAST
And this has been in striking
contrast to his predecessor,
Herbert H. Lehman, who
served 10 years in the office.
Lehman was regarded as a good
Governor. He won three re-elec-
tions and retired with honors.
But he was no Innovator. He
was not, in the sense described
above, a "strong" Governor.
When Truman entered the
White House, he received a
grant of good feeling from the
public. Here, it was said, is a
man who knows he is no super-
man. He will give us quiet
good sense-and so forth.
Even Harding, among whose
scanty stock of virtues was
modesty, enjoyed a burst of
good feeling. And when he died,
he was passionately mourned.
Such public demonstrations
for the average are always
brief. The strong President
endures. He may be attacked
and reviled, and he may be
defeated. But he is a factor in
government and a maker of
opinion. The Constitution was
written to accommodate a
strong President. The rule,
rather than the exception, will
be the President who leads.
Dewey will fit that prescription.
