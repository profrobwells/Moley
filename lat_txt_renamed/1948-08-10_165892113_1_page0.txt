RAYMOND MOLEY:
Communist Inquiries
and the Roosevelts
Mrs. Roosevelt again rushes
to the defense of those charged
with communistic relations,
and again attacks the commit-
tees of Congress. She uses al-
most the identical words of de-
fense that those accused have
used. And in doing this she
follows a purely negative
course. She suggests no alter-
native method of bringing to
the surface facts that deeply
concern her country's welfare.
No thoughtful person doubts
that Congressional investiga-
tions of such matters are very
blunt instruments. But the at-
titude of the administration
with which Mrs. Roosevelt was
so prominently identified left
Congress with a duty for which
it could use nothing more deli-
cate than very blunt instru-
ments.
A POLITICAL ISSUE
She says that these investiga-
tions are "political." Presum-
ably that is intended to discred-
it them. But it cannot be said
that the long investigation of
the Justice Department, includ-
ing the FBI, which first brought
out these facts, was political.
That was a judicial inquiry.
In the broad sense of the
word the issue is political, and
only a decision at the polls can
possibly provide the means to
guard our government against
the obvious dangers that are
now brought to light.
The main issue is political be-
cause from 1933 to 1945 a proc-
ess of infiltration of the govern-
ment service went on, apparent-
ly with the full support of
President Roosevelt, the ulti-
mate end of which could not
help but bring Communist in-
fluence into government.
TWELVE YEARS AGO
The danger of this became
clear at least 12 years ago when
the late Hugh Johnson, this
writer and many others became
highly critical of the administra-
tion. We saw the formation of
a cabal composed of young in-
experienced lawyers and econo-
mists who were generally of one
mind about an attack on our
economic system, who proposed
to use the powers of govern-
ment, in many instances indi-
rectly, to put over a theory of
economic control that had never
been honestly submitted to the
electorate, and who also used
their power to smear business
and all those who opposed
them. Their smearing activi-
ties incidentally were never re-
buked by Mrs. Roosevelt or her
husband.
This group was quite con-
scious of its unity. Its chief at
one time proudly called it his
"well integrated group." This
writer can well remember hear-
ing this chieftain threaten that
if Roosevelt did not do this or
that they would all resign in a
body. They were bluffing, of
course, for they were having
the time of their lives.
IN WALLACE'S AAA
A whole swarm got into Wal-
lace's AAA, and a big fight en-
sued. Later Wallace (and this
is for the book) kicked them all
out. They answered that Wal-
lace was activated by political
ambition, a cry now habitual
with them.
Incidentally, one of the men
mentioned by Mrs. Bentley was
in that purged AAA group.
The issue is deeper than
mere Communism. That is why
it is political. The issue is
whether government depart-
ments which deal with busi-
ness are to be staffed by people
who do not believe in the basic
values of American free enter-
prise.
That Communists should in
turn infiltrate the infiltrators
was inevitable. Their soft in-
tellectual habits made them re-
ceptive to all odd and unortho-
dox persons and ideas.
The remedy must be political
in the sense that such vulner-
able and doubtful employees of
government must be supplanted
by an entire administration of
responsible people.
