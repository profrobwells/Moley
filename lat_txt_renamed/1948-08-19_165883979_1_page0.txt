RAYMOND MOLEY:
Grain Surpluses Will Be
a Political Issue Again
If, as is now becoming clear-
er and clearer, we shall produce
a huge grain crop, the problem of
surpluses will enter the political
picture once more as it did
from 1922 to 1932.
rians and proposed legisla-
tion will emerge, and the major
parties and candidates will be
challenged to endorse them just
as was the case with McNary-
Haugenism 25 years ago. The
vague dread of mounting stores
and falling prices beyond pres-
ent prosperity is already worry-
ing far-seeing farmers.
Dewey and Truman will be
compelled to make this question
a major issue, and laissez-faire
aided by big exports will not be
enough to satisfy an agricul-
tural population that has
opened a Pandora's box of pro-
duction.
BILLION-BUSHEL RESERVE
As I recently noted, the corn
and wheat crops will be large
enough to meet all domestic
and foreign needs and still yield
a vast surplus. The fact that
the surplus cannot be taken
over by export has been noted
by the Secretary of Commerce,
Charles Sawyer, who has issued
a warning.
The reliable Dr. Julius
Hirsch, who last winter correct-
ly warned the administration
that its guesses of foreign
crops were too low, now tells
us that the carry-over will be
389,000,000 bushels of wheat
and 666,000,000 bushels of corn.
This billion-bushel grain re-
serve produces a big problem
of storage. And the prospects
of a surplus chills farmers who
have in former years realized
how seriously such a situation
affects prices. Any such sur-
plus, even when sustained by
the government, is dangerous
as was shown in the Hoover
Farm Board days.
THE CHEMISTS
It hardly appeals to common
sense to ship grain abroad that
must be stored there. Yet that
is what is involved when the
ECA steps up its export goal
from 350,000,000 to 450,000,000
bushels. No doubt this is what
provokes the criticism of Sec-
retary Sawyer.
Such a prospect brings to the
fore once more the attractive
and almost limitless opportuni-
ties for industrial uses of grain.
During the war when a hungry
world looked to us for food the
voice of chemists who knew
how to turn grain into industri-
al products was all but silent.
Now they must have a hear-
ing again.

The farmers of the nation
will be very suspicious about a
return to the economy of scarci-
ty which characterized the New
Deal AAA. They will view with
no enthusiasm new "ever-nor-
mal granary" ideas. These pro-
posals, however, will creep in-
to political promises. In fact,
this prospect may turn Henry
Wallace in his hunt for votes
from city labor to the farms.
The Republicans if they are
to hold the farmers, who start-
ed turning from the New Deal
10 years ago, will have to offer
some statesmanlike ideas di-
rected toward wider industrial
uses of grain. This is not a mat-
ter of government operation
but for wide governmental en-
couragement and for the devel-
opment of technical assistance.
In any event it is a new and
very real challenge to both
parties.
