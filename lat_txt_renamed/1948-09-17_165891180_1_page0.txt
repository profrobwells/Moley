It is becoming increasingly
clear that the British govern-
ment is still intent upon the
wholesale dismantling of Ger-
man industry, despite a slowly
changing policy among Ameri-
can authorities. The danger is
very real that while this dis-
agreement is being adjusted
continuous damage will be done
to what remains of the German
productive plant and that ulti-
mately a costly repair job will
be paid for by American tax-
payers.
We are told that Paul Hoff-
man, ERP Administrator, has
set up another committee "to
consider" revising the policy
of destroying and removing
German industrial plants and
that Secretary of State Marshall
has asked the British and
French to co-operate.
A MORGENTHAU FRIEND
The British hesitate to change
the policy and give several rea-
sonsâ€”none of which is appar-
ently the real reason. It is
quite legitimate to believe that
the real reason is that the Brit-
ish want to eliminate German
industrial competition while
there is a high motive to justify
it. We, of course, would ulti-
mately pay the bill.
Thus, the Morgenthau Plan,
which seems to have nine lives,
finds a friend in another quar-
ter. But the most active allies
of the plan are still those Ameri-
can officials who are intent
upon breaking up industry in
Germany, as well as in Japan.
This column has already
pointed out how in Japan,
under the name of deconcentra-
tion, and in Germany, under the
name of decartelization, the
old American theory of trust-
busting is slowly destroying the
capacity of those countries to
support themselves. In both
places the same school of law-
yer-economists seems to be well
entrenched.
In Germany the job is being
done under Military Govern-
ment Law 56. This law, among
other provisions intended to
break German industry into
small parts, says that "all
economic enterprises (in the
U.S. zone) employing more
than 10,000 persons shall be ex-
amined as prima facie constitut-
ing excessive concentrations of
economic power."
The law would, if effectively
carried out, make Germany a
permanent charge of the United
States. Under it, plants whose
capacity to produce machinery
would assist German recovery
have been dismantled and car-
ried away.
And the irony of it all is the
appearance now, in the lists of
matters for which money is
appropriated by the United
States, of facilities to produce
the same sort of goods which
Germany could have produced
for herself.
House Resolution 520, intro-
duced in April, would have pro-
vided a thorough investigation
of these practices. It failed to
pass. If it should be enacted by
the new Congress, it could very
well be the means of unearthing
a deplorable course of policy
which is still in effect, although
at a somewhat reduced rate.
AN ISSUE FOR DEWEY
If Messrs. Dewey, Warren,
Stassen and other Republican
speakers want an issue which
is well outside the bipartisan
area of foreign policy, they
might well look into this tragic
destruction of both German and
Japanese industry. It runs
squarely against the professed
policy of self-support in Europe
and Asia. It has been imple-
mented by plans created by in-
experienced and incompetent
theorists, and it may well be the
means of strengthening Com-
munism both in Europe and in
Asia.
Most important of all, it
should be determined whether
there are indirect beneficiaries
of this policy of removing
competition in important lines
of manufacturing, here or in
other Allied countries.
