Montana has four electoral
votes which will probably be
superfluous frosting on the
Dewey cake. But it has a Sen-
ate seat which the Republicans
must take or there may be no
savor in the cake itself. It
would be rash to predict the
Senatorial result right now,
but, here is how things stand.
Sen. James E. Murray, whose
devotion to Roosevelt and
Roosevelt policies knew no
bounds, barely squeezed in six
years ago. The largesse of the
Roosevelt-Truman administra-
tion tossed many a grant to
Montana under Murray's in-
fluence. He has the strength
of Federal patronage, a strong
hold on labor, plenty of per-
sonal funds and a bold, aggres-
sive mode of campaigning. He
will do much better than Tru-
man in the harvest of votes.
Against him is running
Thomas Jefferson Davis, a
Butte lawyer of considerable
capacity who attained note as
a president of International
Rotary. He speaks well and
knows how to make a fine im-
pression, although his experl-
ence in practical politics is lim-
ited.
It will be the forces around
Davis which will count in the
result. The Republican Party
in the State is in fairly good
shape. They have the Gov-
ernorship, one Senator, one of
two Congressmen, adequate
finances and experienced lead-
ers.
The national Republican
forces will give special atten-
tion to Montana, for this Sen-
ate seat may be the balance
between the parties in organiz-
ing the next Senate. Dewey
will be here, and Warren will
make several appearances.
Stassen is strong in the whole
Northwest and is expected to
participate in the Montana
campaign.
Several powerful forces,
aside from the Republican
Party, will operate against
Murray. To mention one not
inconsiderable item, most of
the doctors of the State who
have been awakened nationally
to the importance of politics
will be more or less actively
against the sponsor of the con-
troversial Murray-Wagner-Din-
gell government medicine bill.
Political prescriptions will
mingle with those of the tra-
ditional medical sort, just as
they did in the Dewey-Stassen
Oregon primary.
The Republicans have handi-
caps, too. Their Governor, Sam
C. Ford, running for re-election,
is not strong with his party.
Nor do the available polls show
Ford strength with voters. His
Democratic opponent, John
Bonner, former Attorney Gen-
eral and World War II veteran,
is showing unexpected strength.
The holdover Senator, Zales
Ecton, is a sound and able man
who has been quiet—some say
unnecessarily quiet—in his two
years of service. He can help
the Republican ticket to a de-
gree, if he so chooses.
The two Congressmen from
Montana, Mike Mansfield from
the Democratic west and Wes-
ley D'Ewart from the Republi-
can east, will probably win, but
Mansfield may have trouble
against a strong opponent.
Montana, the State which
gave the two Senators who
shook the Harding-Coolidge
regime 25 years ago, is again
on the political map.
