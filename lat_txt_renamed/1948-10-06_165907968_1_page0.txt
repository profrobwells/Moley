Gov. Dewey's warning that
there should not be another
Munich serves the purpose of
warning Russia that no soft
policy can be expected if he
wins. But there are dangers in
comparing the present dealings
with Soviet Russia with those
carried on by Chamberlain and
Daladier with Hitler 10 years
ago.
No better explanation of the
distinction has been made than
that of the British weekly, the
Economist, in its last issue. In
an article captioned "No Peace
-No War," it is pointed out
that the failure of the summer's
negotiations should "dispel any
last lingering illusion about the
possibility of talking the Rus-
sians into a peaceful settlement.
'They will talk, they will go
through the motions of nego-
tiation, but they make no con-
cessions themselves, and each
concession made to them is
simply the prelude to a further
demand."
The Economist goes on to say
that Mr. Bevin's analogy of cur-
rent negotiations with those
carried on with the Nazis is in-
correct in a vital respect:
"Clearly, if Russian policy were
exactly moulded on the Nazis',
war would be inevitable. But
there are differences between
the brown and the red-not, in-
deed, in scruple or morality, or
even perhaps in ultimate ambi-
tion, but in recklessness of
method. Hitler was in a hurry
and wanted war for its own
sake; the Soviets have shown
that they will avoid it if they
can and wait upon events,
which they believe to be mov-
ing inexorably in their favor.
And, in spite of the hysterical
attacks upon 'American Fascist
imperialism' and the blind be-
lief in Communism's world mis-
sion, the diet of words fed to
the Russians is still very dif-
ferent from the glorification of
militarism and war which was
stuffed into the ears of the
German people. The Rus-
sians are not taught to seek war
as such, and in the past their
leaders have known when to
stop. In this lies a reasonable
basis for a continuing belief in
peace."
The unfortunate fact is that
American diplomacy is domi-
nated by military menâ€”by
Marshall, Smith and by our
National Security Council. The
latter is composed of the Sec-
retaries of State, Defense, War,
Navy, Air, and the chairman of
the National Security Re-
sources Board. To the military
mind, one potential enemy
thinks like any other potential
enemy.
Thus, it is assumed that
Russian negotiations will pro-
ceed like those futile dealings
with Germany before Armaged-
don. For instance, because
Germany quit the League of
Nations, it is assumed that the
Russians will quit the United
Nations. Maybe they will, but
there are many reasons to be-
lieve they will not. The United
Nations provides a fine stage
for the Vishinskys. The pur-
pose of Communism is penetra-
tion without war. The Nazi
faith was in arms and in quick
attack. Russian policy for
over a century has been slow,
annoying encroachments and a
continuous effort to reach
warm water in the Mediter-
ranean Basin and in Asia.
Moreover, Russian with-
drawal would mean Russian
isolation. The Soviet from
then on would be waging a de-
fensive cold war. It would vir-
tually force more unity upon
the western world. And as
Bevin suggests, it would bring
to the fore, once again, the or-
ganization of the world
through regional groupings.
Perhaps that would bring into
being a safer world.
But for that very reason the
Soviet statesmen will probably
not force the issue by with-
drawing. If their aim is to
isolate themselves, the danger
of war will be lessened. But
if their real aim is to avoid
war while they continue to
highlight the danger of war, it
can best be accomplished by
their present tactics.
