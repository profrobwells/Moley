Trying to Pull a Rabbit,
Truman Wrecks the Hat
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last Sunday, as this reporter,
with more than 86,000 other
dazed and saddened World Se-
ries customers, turned his steps
up the long hill from the Me-
morial Stadium at Cleveland,
he heard a great deal about
overconfidence. The city of
Cleveland, in full anticipation
of ending the series with trim-
mings of brass bands and street
dancing, was overconfident. So
were the Indians. But Feller
slipped, and excellent Braves
management won.
If Dewey were running
against a Roosevelt, the over-
confidence of Republicans at
this stage might defeat him.
But apparently our harassed
President can do nothing but
supply more and more confi-
dence for Republicans. His abor-
tive Vinson mission to Moscow
supplies a vivid object lesson in
why Dewey, despite lack of
campaign color and excitement,
has such a lead over Truman.
We have witnessed once more
an illustration of bad manage-
ment—bad administration. And
Dewey, who does not deny the
general objectives of the Roose-
velt regime, is really running
as a successful executive.
HIS EXPLANATION
The President's own explana-
tion of why he dropped the
Vinson idea reveals what is
wrong with his capacity as a
Chief Executive. He didn’t
know his idea was loaded. He
had to go back to Washington,
bring Marshall over the sea and
be told about goings on in Paris
before he realized that his plan
was bad.
After he had tried to emulate
his successful predecessor,
Roosevelt, by pulling a rabbit
out of the hat, he found that the
only way he could get the rab-
bit out was to destroy the hat.
No doubt his plan, if carried
out, would have caused the res-
ignation of his Secretary of
State and of the steady, reliable
Undersecretary Robert Lovett,
who, incidentally, took the job
only because Marshall insisted
upon it.
So now we have had two ex-
amples of lack of capacity on
the President’s part to keep in
step with his own subordinates.
When Wallace, while a Cabinet
member, made his unfortunate
Russian speech which the
President approved without
reading, Secretary of State
Byrnes was, like Marshall now,
in close contact with repre-
sentatives of other nations in
Paris. Outraged by this lack of
teamwork, Byrnes threatened
to resign, and the President
fired Wallace.
GOOD ADMINISTRATION
This comment is not con-
cerned with the danger to for-
eign affairs involved in Tru-
man’s proposal. That has been
abundantly pointed out. Nor
does it suggest the political in-
eptness of Truman’s hasty
plan. It is merely to point out
once more the importance of
plain administrative compe-
tence. Our ideals may shine in
the sky, but our practical pro-
cedures on the ground must be
efficient and effective.
