Despite geographical proxim-
ity, West Virginia and Ken-
tucky have quite different po-
litical problems and character-
istics. This year, however, the
two States have a common in-
terest which is also a national
concern. Both have Republican
Senators who are fighting hard
fore-election. Both races
promise to be close. The situa-
tion looks fairly bright for Re-
publican Sen. John S. Cooper in
Kentucky and about even for
Republican Sen. Chapman Rev-
ercomb in West Virginia.
In West Virginia the final re-
sult may well depend on the
vote of the miners. They have
been instructed by their leaders
to vote for former Sen. Mat-
thew Neely. Republicans hope,
however, that their indifferent
or hostile attitude toward Presi-
dent Truman will on election
day send them away from the
polls and into the hills, deer
hunting. In any event, there
will be plenty of hunting on
Nov. 2, and whether there will
be a lot of frightened deer or
scared Republicans remains to
be seen.
Apathy toward all Presiden-
tial candidates, including Wal-
lace, seems to dominate these
October days.
Wallace will take some votes
from Neely, but the Dixiecrats
are not a factor. Neely, of
course, is strong for Truman.
Neely, in his 74th year, is still a
strong campaigner, and the
State Democratic machine, fight-
ing for life, knows all the tricks
of the trade.
Revercomb has not been hurt
in West Virginia by his alleged
isolationism and his stand on
displaced persons, despite the
apparent displeasure of Dewey
and Warren. The national trend
favors Dewey's carrying the
State, and since the ballot form
is of the old-fashioned straight
variety, Dewey will tend to pull
the ticket through. At this
writing the race is even.
Dewey's chances on the po-
litical turf of Kentucky are not
good. Barkley's name on the
ticket means a lot in this State.
So despite a national tide, Ken-
tucky spirit will sustain the na-
tive son's ticket. There will be
little Dixiecrat strength. The
80,000 Democratic majority of
1944 will not be reached this
year. Democrats will settle now
for 50,000.
The race for the Senate favors
Cooper. He has no labor handi-
cap, since he and his opponent,
Virgil Chapman, both voted for
the Taft-Hartley Law. Cooper
appeals to progressive Demo-
crats and Republicans. The
Louisville Courier Journal — a
sort of political racing form for
eastern journalists who visit
the State — is for Cooper, Tru-
man and Barkley.
Chapman is helped by a Dem-
ocratic State administration
which won easily last year after
an unsuccessful and unpopular
Republican stay at the State-
house. The State government
has helped itself by a gasoline
tax program which is popular
among the farmers. With the
Democrats in good shape and,
as a sage Kentuckian remarked,
with "all their fences up,"
Cooper will have hard running
against the local tide. But the
best judges think he will finish
first.
