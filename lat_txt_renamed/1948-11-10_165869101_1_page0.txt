The sharp postelection break
in the stock exchange merely
reflected the surprise and con-
sternation felt in all business
circles. The first breathless
question, heard on all sides,
"What happened?" was fol-
lowed by another, more practi-
cal one, "What will happen?"
It would be foolish optimism
to gather together a few scraps
of reassurance and ignore the
larger items of business uncer-
tainty that must prevail for
some weeks.
We might as well face it. A
Dewey victory would have been
good for business, at least for
the immediate, foreseeable fu-
ture. Truman's election was a
victory for a continuation of
government management of our
economy. If he seeks to re-
ward the farmers who turned to
him and the workers who
elected Democratic Congress-
men, his course will be some-
what inflationary. There is
much that he can do alone in
that direction, and much that he
can ask Congress to do.
NO REVOLUTIONS
But neither Truman's popu-
lar majority, his cloudy man-
date nor the moderate Demo-
cratic majority in Congress
justifies a belief that he can
have his way with legislation.
Whatever he gets will be by
compromise and long negotia-
tion. This Congress, like those
of the last few years, has no
taste for revolution. The South
and the Republicans will stand
against a wider growth of gov-
ernment control.
Moreover, as far as the infla-
tion picture is concerned, natu-
ral forces are operating. The
great boom is flattening out.
This cannot continue without
breaks in some business lines
and a distinct danger of slowly
falling employment and busi-
ness volume. A rapid decline
will be fairly effectively slowed
down by executive action, for
above all Truman is committed
to the maintenance of pros-
perity.
THE BUDGET
The budget picture will, de-
spite a continued high rate of
spending, be a powerful argu-
ment against increased taxes-
even against a partial restora-
tion of excess profits taxes.
In the fiscal year ending last
June, we had a total tax income
of $48,000,000,000. This was
cut by the Republican tax re-
duction to $43,000,000,000. The
highest forecasts for the forth-
coming budget for next year
are about $44,000,000,000.
It is already certain, how-
ever, that the national income
in the second half of the calen-
dar year 1948 will be 10%
higher than a year ago. The
income which will yield taxes
for the fiscal year 1950 will be,
in the main, the income earned
in the present fiscal year 1949.
Hence, we may well anticipate
a Federal tax income for the
next fiscal year of $48,000,000,-
000 or more. This would seem
to preclude any tax increase.
