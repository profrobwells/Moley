Huey Long's spirit still lives
in the back parishes of Louisi-
ana, and his ruthless political
methods are still practiced by
his brother, Earl Long. But the
election showed that the sur-
viving Longs lack the blazing
mentality which invariably won
victory for the late Huey. Civic
and business leadership in the
cities decisively defeated an ef-
fort by Long to seize control of
the Port of New Orleans.
Safely established in the
State government by a big ma-
jority early in the year and as-
sured of the election to the Sen-
ate of Huey's son Russell, the
Long machine went to the polls
this year with a choice assort-
ment of constitutional amend-
ments. These amendments were
designed to enhance the power
of the State administration over
local matters, particularly over
the board which governs the
Port of New Orleans. This
great port would have provided
Long's State machine with a
lucrative prize.
GIRDING FOR BATTLE
But in the years since Huey's
demise, the city of New Orleans
has developed a civic conscious-
ness and an aggressive business
leadership which met the issue
head on.
A huge committee was formed
to fight the port measure. Citi-
zens with no direct dealings
with the port and with no par-
ticular party affiliations put
aside personal and factional con-
siderations to help kill the
amendment The reform Mayor
of New Orleans, DeLesseps Mor-
rison, took an active part.
Money was raised to buy news-
paper space and radio time. Citi-
zens of the entire State were
warned that they had a deep
personal interest in the pros-
perity of the port.
With most of the precincts
counted, all nine of the "power
grab" amendments have been
defeated. The most important
of these—the one dealing with
the Port Authority—seems to
have been defeated by more
than 30,000 votes.
STRANGE COUNTING
Of course, the usual queer
business appeared in some of
the parishes controlled by the
Longs. Incongruous percentages
of votes were turned in. In some
of these parishes, the votes on
the amendments were 25 per
cent greater than the Presiden-
tial returns; whereas in some of
the sections where the Long ma-
chine has never been strong, the
vote on the amendments ran
considerably under the Presi-
dential vote.
This result was due not only
to the activity of those interests
adversely affected by the port
measure, but by the ineptitude
already shown by Gov. Earl
Long. Even in the few months
during which he has served as
Governor, he has shown that he
has very little of the political
acumen of his late brother.
Workingmen in the parishes, to
whom he promised so much, are
already muttering over in-
creased taxes on cigarettes and
tobacco, part of an all-inclusive
sales tax.
REVOLT OF THE CITIES
Punitive legislation against
the cities has so outraged the
people of New Orleans, Shreve-
port, Baton Rouge and Lake
Charles that they turned against
Russell Long, the spittin' image
of his father, in the primary
race for Senator and almost
overcame the very dubious vote
from the upstate parishes.
In the case of the vote for
Senator, however, the old prac-
tice of withholding the vote in
the upstate parishes until it
was ascertained how many
would be needed to accomplish
the result sufficed to elect the
youthful Long. But apparently
those parishes were unable to
count fast enough to keep up
with the enraged vote of the
citizens of the cities on the
amendments.
The Long tradition will still
be a great factor in Louisiana
politics. But the city of New
Orleans, struggling to maintain
its ascendancy as a great port
and manufacturing center,
seems to have been saved from
an immediate and serious
threat.
