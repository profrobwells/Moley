The best story in Billy Rose's
very funny book, "Wine, Wom-
en and Words," has to do with
one of his shows, in which
there was an elephant. Jimmy
Durante was caught by a Sher-
iff in the act of stealing the
elephant. "Where are ya going
with that elephant?" demand-
ed the Sheriff. "What ele-
phant?" asked Durante.
Now is the season for free
advice about what the Repub-
lican Party should do. This ad-
vice is a hardy quadrennial.
The same admonitions have
been phrased after five succes-
sive elections. They run some-
thing like this: The Republicans
must reorganize; they must be
younger; they must look for-
ward; they must look backward;
they must be the liberal par-
ty; they must be the conserva-
tive party; they must not ape
the New Deal; they must learn
a lesson from Roosevelt, and
so on.
FIND THE BODY
But before we start the in-
quisition, we must identify the
corpus.
The really pertinent question
is: "What Republican Party?"
Is it Dewey and the "team"
that determined what he ut-
tered as Republican doctrine?
Is it the national commit-
tee's high command, personal-
ly selected by the recent candi-
date?
Is it Taft, Vandenberg, Mar-
tin and the other leaders of the
80th Congress?
Is it Hoover and others who
once headed the party?
Is it the conglomerate mass of
voters who voted for Dewey
and Warren?
What is it?
DEWEY THE TARGET
Private and public remarks
among Republican leaders since
the election are caustic. Dewey
is being raked from stem to
stern. They are saying that he
didn't say anything; that he dis-
dained the venerable former
leaders of the party, of whom
some of the most distinguished
did not hear from Dewey from
convention to election; that he
did not specifically defend the
80th Congress; and on and on.
Dewey people blamed promi-
nent people in the Republican
Party for inactivity. They say
that State organizations, notably
in Ohio, concentrated on the
State ticket and failed to rally
the votes for Dewey and War-
ren. It was the low vote that
did it. And that it was the rec-
ord of the 80th Congress and
not the Dewey speeches and ree-
ord which defeated him.
RESPONSIBILITY VAGUE
Until this clamor dies down,
it will be hard to identify those
who will be responsible for
preparing a course of action for
the party in the months and
years ahead.
On Armistice Day eight years
ago, Wendell Willkie made a
notable postelection address. He
spoke of the importance of
maintaining a strong opposi-
tion. He offered to lead that
opposition. And he identified the
group which he proposed to lead
as the 22,000,000-odd who had
voted for him. This group, if it
had had cohesion, would in
truth have been a mighty army.
But, it had only one common
purpose to beat Roosevelt.
Nor did Willkie fulfill his
promise. He spent his later
years in matters which had lit-
tle to do with building a party.
In fact, many if not most Re-
publican leaders believed he
was determined chiefly to at-
tack them. And his personal
voter following melted away.
NO LOYAL OPPOSITION
The difficulty in identifying
a party out of power rises from
the nature of our constitutional
system and the party practices
which have grown upon it.
There is no party between con-
ventions. There are people, lead-
ers and committees which are
called Republican. There are
minority groups in Congress.
But there is no party.
Somehow, it seems that be-
fore a program can be made,
there will have to be a group of
leaders which has cohesion and
responsibility. Such a group
does not exist today.
