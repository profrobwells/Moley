Farm Honeymoon Ending;
Potato Supports to Fall
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The first big problem oi agri-
cultural surpluses has been
met by a postelection announce-
ment by the administration of
a reduction in the support price
of potatoes. This announce-
ment is hedged by the fact that
the reduction, from 90% of a
parity to 60%, will not be effec-
tive until the 1949 crop year.
But it is a stih warning to
potato farmers and a rather
faint promise of lower prices
for consumers.
The humble potato has been
a political headache for three
years. In 1946 there was a
considerable oversupply. The
Commodities Credit Corporation
bought part of the crop to help
support the support price. Dis-
tillers were urged to buy pota-
toes for conversion into liquor.
This idea was not happily
greeted by distillers, because the
American market does not re-
act favorably to potato liquor.
NOBLE EXPERIMENT
Perhaps this is due to habit
rather than to the character of
the liquor itself. Europe knows
how to make and apparently
likes to drink potato-made
liquor. Russian vodka is large-
ly a product of potatoes. The
excellent Irish whisky is main-
ly a potato product. European
countries have other versions of
potato stimulants. But corn-
fed America prefers something
else.
When Secretary of Agricul-
ture Anderson was in office he
attempted a bold experiment
with potato flour for overseas
relief. The cost of this prod-
uct was highâ€”25 cents a pound.
Europeans were unwilling to
pay such a price. UNRRA DI-
rector LaGuardia spurned the
stuff, saying that at best he
could offer only 1 cent a pound.
Despite these efforts at relief,
the support bill in 1947 was
$39,500,000 on a crop of 385,-
000,000 bushels.
NOT UNTIL 1950
The 1948 crop jumped to
432,000,000 bushels. Again, the
potato-flour experiment was
attempted, at the same high
25-cent price. The CCC bought
some for relief feeding in Ger-
many. But this year we have
an ample supply of wheat
which, converted into meal,
costs only 7 cents a pound and
has a higher nutrition value.
Present estimates are that the
cost to the Treasury for this
year's crop will be more than
$100,000,000.
The Aiken Act of 1948 pro-
vided that no agricultural prod-
uct can be reduced from the
90% support level before 1950.
However, this legislation says,
"Irish potatoes harvested after
Dec. 31, 1949, are to be support-
ed at no less than 60% or more
than 90% of the parity price."
This means that the present
announcement applies only to
potatoes which cannot be plant-
ed before the late fall of 1949.
EARLY WARNING
Is that early warning meant
to mean that farmers should
plan before then to turn potato
land into land for other com-
modities? On the other hand,
that stalwart exponent of high-
er farm prices at any cost, Sen.
Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma,
prospective Senate Agriculture
Committee chairman, pledges a
support price at no less than
90%.
The administration's potato
announcement is a plain admis-
sion that glowing campaign
promises cannot permanently
stand against natural forces.
Both sides in the late campaign
plentifully baited their hooks
with promises to the farmers.
Both knew when they did so
that bad news was inevitable
And now the side whose bait
was most visible and tangible
having won the election, must
find means of relief. For pota-
toes are not the only crop
which threatens a surplus.
