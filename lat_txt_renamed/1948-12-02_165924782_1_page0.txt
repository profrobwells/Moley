Deflationary Forces Seen
Tempering Wage Demands
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is too broad a statement to
say that price inflation is a state
of mind. But it has been true
as far back as there are economic
records that, unless there
are exceedingly abnormal conditions
in the supply of money
and goods, the general attitude
of the consumer can make or
break price inflation.
в. м. вагuen throughout the
war told us that as long as people
did not lose faith in their
money altogether, there would
be no runaway inflation. There
was no runaway inflation, although
during and since the
war there were enough price increases
to cause great discomfort,
some panic and general uncertainty.
PUBLIC ATTITUDE
The present and future attitude
of the public, therefore,
must be examined with care, if
we are to make an estimate of
the future of this inflationary
boom. What is there in the
present situation which may affect
the public attitude, and
what course may be anticipated?
In the first place, it will be
well for those millions who voted
for Dewey and the other millions
who voted for Truman, despite
their belief that he would
lose, to keep in mind one fact
which has been grossly underestimated
by those who scan
the economic weather.
lions voted for Truman in the
belief that he could stop inflation
and that Republicans had
up to now frustrated his efforts.
Those millions have vast purchasing
power. Their attitude
at the moment must be that
prices will be checked or will
come down. It is the simplest
of simple sense, therefore, to
expect that those millions will
put a brake on their buying.
They will wait a while, until
Truman gets busy on his plans
for helping them.
GOOD OR BAD
In reasoning this way we
need not consider whether Truman's
plans will be wise or
good. In politics and economics
it is just as important to
note what people believe as it
is to examine the wisdom of
their belief. What they believe,
whether it be true or not, greatly
influences the course of
events.
To repeat, millions believe
prices will come down, and that
belief is and will be a considerable
check on inflation, for
the time being at least. It is
risky to suggest that this has
already caused a slowing down
in some markets, such as department
stores or the stock
market. But it may well be
that this factor is highly important
in both places.
As noted above, however,
public psychology is only one
factor in the picture. Do the
present supplies of money and
goods present abnormalities
great enough to outweigh consumer
reluctance to buy?
DEFICIT UNLIKELY
The general answer to that is
"no." There is no immediate
danger of an oversupply of currency,
for there is no over-
supply at present, nor is there
a prospective increase in sight.
Clarence Cannon, prospective
Democratic chairman of Appropriations,
is already talking
about budget cuts and debt reduction.
There is not likely to
be any immediate rise in bank
credits, because the purchasing
power of bank credits measured
with total business volume is no
higher than in 1939.
There is, of course, the prospective
drive for a fourth round
of wage increases. That drive
will certainly be made. But
such an inflationary force does
not hit all at once. It generally
arrives, from place to place, as
contracts expire or as specific
unions feel that the time is ripe.
The argument for such increases
will lose force as the
cost of living declines or fails
to rise.
