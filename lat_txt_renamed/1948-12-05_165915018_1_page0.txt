FAO Held Poor Prophet
of World Food Demands
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his first public speech
after the election, President Tru-
man honored the Food and
Agriculture Organization. He
uttered some pre-Thanksgiving
pleasantries which were well
received by a considerable num-
ber of foreign experts and near-
experts who came to discuss the
interesting subject of food. Per-
haps a stray taxpayer or two,
reading of this in his news-
paper, asked himself the ques-
tion, "Just what is this FAO
and what is it good for?"
The FAO is theoretically a
part of the United Nations. It
was founded three years ago to
bring about international co-
operation in the agriculture and
food field. It has been described
as a sort of institute for world-
wide planning. Although the
Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion had its parentage in the
United Nations, it has largely
operated as an independent
agency, even to the extent of
selecting new members and ob-
servers.
FAMINE FORECAST
With its high-sounding title
and pretensions, its figures and
predictions have had a totally
undue influence in Washington.
And on the record it has not
been particularly happy in its
predictions. In May, 1946, it
predicted a great shortage of
food-a need for 30,000,000
metric tons of grain, with only
18,000,000 or 20,000,000 tons
available. Ultimately, it was
found that there was a 27,000,-
000-ton balance of supply and
demand for world export.
In the early autumn of 1947,
the FAO, from then on rein-
forced by the International
Emergency Food Council, pre-
dicted that 50,000,000 tons
would be needed, with only 27,
000,000 or 28,000,000 tons avail-
able in the world. This predic-
tion of a huge shortage had a
terrific inflationary influence on
prices and was partly re-
sponsible for the famous specu-
lative spree a year ago.
This column, on reliable in-
formation, registered doubt
about those figures in early
November of that year. By
spring of this year the error
was belatedly admitted, but
after so many people and
agencies knew the error that
the yeast had gone out of the
market.
The tendency of the FAO has
been to exaggerate require-
ments for food in not basing
them on the eating habits of
European countries, let alone
those of the yellow and brown
peoples of the world. Nutrition-
ists like Sir John Boyd Orr,
former FAO chairman, were
responsible for a great scare
about undernourishment for the
next 25 years, at a time when
menacing surpluses could be
foreseen in the near future.
NO CO-OPERATION
The hope that the FAO could
induce the co-operation of the
nations in food production and
consumption has been shat-
tered. Each nation has adopted
its own policies, suited to its
own internal conditions. Bi-
lateral trade agreements have
become the rule, and free trade
or multilateral agreements the
exception.
Agricultural and food sta-
tistics should issue from our
own Department of Agriculture,
as before the war. As far as in-
ternational figures are con-
cerned, the International Agri-
cultural Institute in Rome did a
good job before the war, with
vastly less money and fewer em-
ployees than the FAO. Techni-
cal help to underdeveloped
countries can be provided with-
out an FAO.
This overlapping in food mat-
ters, as well as in other fields,
should be noted by the Hoover
Commission. And the FAO
should be moved back into the
United Nations, where it origi-
nated and where it belongs.
