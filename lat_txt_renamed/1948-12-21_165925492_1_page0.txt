British Plan to Socialize
Legal Profession Eyed by
Eager U.S. Collectivists
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may not be long before
the lawyers will find themselves
shoulder to shoulder with the
doctors in a fight against social-
ization. England, having in-
stalled government medicine,
now proposes to establish a
form of government-supported
legal service. It can be taken
for granted that zealous reform-
ers and politicians in search of
an issue will start a drive for
the same thing here. And if
the threat of government medi-
cine has made doctors political-
ly conscious, imagine what it
will do to lawyers!
GOVERNMENT PAYS
The English plan is contained
in a legal aid and advice bill,
presented in November to Par-
liament by the Lord High
Chancellor. It will probably
be enacted by the Socialist ma-
jority without much delay. Un-
der this Socialist plan, the bar
will remain, as in, the past, an
agency and creature of the
courts. Barristers and solici-
tors will continue to practice in
their present chambers, alone
or in partnership.
But in cases involving needy
persons—defined as those with
net incomes below $1700 a year
or with net capital of less than
$2100—fees will be paid in
whole or in part by the govern-
ment to the lawyers giving the
service. In higher courts, the
government will pay 85% of
the fee; in county courts, all of
it. The size of the fees will
apparently be fixed by the law-
yers, under some sort of semi-
co-operative arrangement.
The client will be permitted
to choose his lawyer. The law-
yer will remain in private prac-
tice. And he will be paid in
fees, not by a government sal-
ary.
MORE SOCIALIZATION
This scheme is presented in
England as a relatively con-
servative compromise with com-
plete governmentalization of
the legal profession, such as
prevails in Soviet Russia. There
the lawyer is a creature and
employee of the Ministry of
Justice. He practices when and
where he is assigned. The gov-
ernment fixes the fees and no
client needs prove that he is
unable to pay.
Arguments to adopt the Brit-
ish plan in this country will be
powerful, and local bar associa-
tions will be well advised to
prepare for the onslaught. The
left wing of the triumphant
Democratic Party is thirsting
for new forms of what it calls
"socialization." It conceives the
election to have been a mandate
to continue the march toward
statism.
It has no Roosevelt to think
up new schemes; Truman, after
all, has been living on the frag-
ments left by his predecessor.
Here is a scheme ready-made,
with immense political poten-
tialities which almost any Con-
gressman can use to gain no-
table publicity for himself.
The conservative element in
the American bar will face dis-
advantages in meeting such an
attack which are not faced by
the medical profession. The
latter is a more carefully se-
lected group. Requirements for
the practice of medicine are
vastly more rigid than those
prevailing for admission to the
bar.
PROFESSION DISUNITED
The profession itself has less
unity than that of medicine.
Only a fraction of the profes-
sion belongs to the American
Bar Association, and local asso-
ciations in the cities do not in-
clude all or even a big major-
ity of practitioners. A great
number of lawyers are working
for small and precarious in-
comes. And it is fair to say
that intense antagonism pre-
vails among the less successful
against the more opulent firms
and individuals. The profession
in many places is sharply divid-
ed between the so-called plain-
tiff and defendant sides of prac-
tice. And there are many loud
and persistent left-wingers
among lawyers.
It must be recognized that a
great deal of evidence can be
produced to indicate that jus-
tice is not available in equal
measure to rich and poor alike.
Rapacious and incompetent
lawyers still prey upon the ig-
norant and the needy. Right-
minded lawyers, judges and so-
cial agencies have done much to
eliminate exploitation, but
much remains to be done.
The real issue is whether
these evils can be cured by
more government and more
paternalism.
