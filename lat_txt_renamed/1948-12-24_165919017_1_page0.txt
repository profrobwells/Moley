Army's Missing Tanks
Point a Bookkeeping Moral
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Early previews of the Hoover
report on reorganizing the gov-
ernment show the danger that
superficial matters of interest
to the public may obscure the
real meat of the findings.
The public seems to be greatly
interested in proposals to raise
the salaries of the President and
higher officers of the govern-
ment. But the vastly more im-
portant findings in the Ferdi-
nand Eberstadt report on na-
tional security will be forgotten
unless great efforts are made to
promote and popularize them.
It is really not very impor-
tant whether the salaries of the
high officers of the government
are increased or not. The gov-
ernment receives in taxes a
large part of what it pays out
in big salaries. The ability of
the President and other high
officials to acquire real main-
tenance by free transportation,
medical care, yachts, aircraft
and the like is much more im-
portant than salary. Moreover,
no person worth hiring is going
to take or keep a Cabinet job
because of the pay. And the
President is not suffering on his
present salary.
But it is important to know
that, because there is no ade-
quate over-all accounting and
control of government business,
huge amounts of property are
lost in the maze of bureaucracy.
The Eberstadt report says that
85,000 tanks were produced dur-
ing the war. Then, with some
difficulty the committee learned
from Army statistics that 25,000
of these were on hand at the end
of the war. But, astonishing as
it may seem, only 16,000 of
these could be accounted for by
the Army. The Army "was un-
able to state what had become
of the others."
Another item would be down-
right funny if it did not carry
such serious implications. The
report relates that the budget
estimates for 1950 show re-
quests for the "modernization"
of 103 more tanks of a certain
kind than the Army possessed.
The report points out, fur-
ther, that the committee was
unable to compare with any
reasonable accuracy the cost of
defense items, because each of
the armed services employs dis-
similar administrative struc-
tures and budgetary and ac-
counting procedures.
WHO CAN KNOW?
Since that is true, how is
Congress or the taxpayer to
know whether national defense
calls for the $30,000,000,000 the
services say they need, or the
$32,000,000,000 which is also
talked about, or the $15,000,000,-
000 the President is trying to
get, or what? The Eberstadt
statement that military men
have no "sense of cost conscious-
ness" is a colossal understate-
ment. The fact is that in mili-
tary matters, as in most of the
other government activities, it
is impossible to tell whether
the amount asked for is an
egregious bargaining bid or a
true statement of need.
The reports which will
emerge from time to time will
all lead up to a really big point.
That is that until Congress pro-
vides itself with a real means of
continuous investigation, ac-
counting and auditing, little can
be done to reform our govern-
ment. There was a flitting
dream of this nearly 30 years
ago, when the Office of Comp-
troller General was conceived.
But that office, too, seems to be
lost in the mazes of its own
routine.
