Un-American Committee
Needs Strong Leadership
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After the cruel mess that Rep.
Mundt made of the death of
Laurence Duggan, Congres-
sional as well as general pub-
lic opinion is going to demand a
new sort of Un-American Activi-
ties Committee or no commit-
tee at all.
once more all the defects
which have attended the Com-
mittee's activities from the be-
ginning. It is not mere proce-
dure that needs to be changed.
A good committee creates a
good procedure. The matter
goes back to personnel and fa-
cilities for investigation.
The investigation, disclosure
and correction of a situation in
which personal guilt, had prac-
tices and inadequate laws are
involved requires very special
competence. Outstanding Con-
gressional investigations such
as the Teapot Dome affair
show that. It is shown, too, by
such local investigations, as
Maurice Milligan's probe of the
Pendergast machine in Kansas
City, Samuel Seabury's raking
of Tammany and Thomas E.
Dewey's exposure of racketeer-
ing in New York.
SIFTING THE GOSSIP
In all these instances a
strong, sympathetic and meticu-
lously careful lawyer spear-
headed the investigation. Moun-
tains of evidence must be gath-
ered, sifted and pieced together.
A vast amount of gossip, rumor
and surmise must be consid-
ered and verified.
Anyone who has been in such
an investigation or who has
worked in an ordinary prose-
cutor's office learns how loosely
character assassination is al-
ways drifting around. Crack-
pots of all sorts come in with
weird stories about most repu-
table and innocent people.
Such victims must be protected
in the strict confidence of the
investigators. Names must not
be brought into public hearings
unless they are vitally neces-
sary to the objective sought.
The investigators must al-
ways consider how the irre-
sponsible elements of the press
will blow up a casual inference
into a damning and lasting
smear of innocent people. The
major objective must be pur-
sued inexorably, and all inter-
esting but irrelevant detours
must be avoided.
All this requires great legal
ability, and strict centralized
control by a strong man. The
late Thomas J. Walsh, Milli-
gan, Seabury and Dewey were
such investigators.
The present Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee is headed by
an insurance broker. There
seem to be only four lawyers
among the members, and the
two who appear to have had
any considerable experience in
the law have been somewhat
inactive. The chief investigator,
Robert Stripling, is not a law-
yer. Mundt seems to have spent
most of his nonpolitical life
in such specialties as speech
and social science teaching, fish
and game, loan and invest-
ments.
The evidence of gross lack of
preparation of cases by the
Committee is spread all through
the record. Its work has always
been scattered. And since the
physical and legal difficulties of
Thomas, the Committee has
been virtually headless.
Thus unmanned and undi-
rected, its members have been
running in all directions. It is
no wonder that such a careen-
ing vehicle has hit innocent by-
standers. The wonder is that
there have been so few casual-
ties.
This government is entitled
to better service or none at all.
