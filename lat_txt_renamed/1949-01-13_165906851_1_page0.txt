Wheel Turns Full Circle
in House Rules Change
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No revolutionary legislation
is likely, despite the President's
gestures toward carrying out
his campaign promises. This
Congress, like its immediate
predecessors, is likely to he ex-
pensive but not radical. It will
be expensive because it is so
easy to spend money both with-
in and without Presidential
budget requests. It will be mild-
ly conservative because its new
leaders, its procedure and its
habits closely follow tradition.
In changing its rules, the
House simply registered once
more its conviction that de-
mocracy may be all right for
political oratory but that it
cannot work in a legislative
body. In this the House is wise
indeed. The House is so big
and its membership so miscel-
laneous in ability and training
that it must have discipline.
It has always had a boss. The
question has been the identity
of the holder of the whip.
SPEAKER SHORN
Nearly 39 years ago, on March
18, 1910, a group of insurgent
Republicans headed by George
Norris and Victor Murdock
"overthrew" Czar Cannon.
Speaker Joe Cannon, although
personally very popular, be-
longed to the conservative tradi-
tion. He appointed all commit-
tees, including the powerful
Committee on Rules on which
he served as Chairman.
The resolution jammed
through by the "Insurgents"
took from the Speaker the ap-
pointment of the Committee on
Rules and ousted him from
membership in that body. The
next House took from the
Speaker all power to appoint
committees and entrusted that
to the House itself.
In the course of time, partic-
ularly in the past 10 years, the
Committee on Rules has as-
sumed great power. It gathered
to itself much of the authority
over legislation which the
Speaker had in the days of
Cannon.
The new House has now
curbed the Committee on Rules.
It has provided that if the Committee refuses to give a bill the
right of way, the Chairman in
charge of the bill can move,
after 21 days, that the measure
go to the House. Actually, this
gives great power to Speaker
Rayburn, who can invoke the
traditional practice of Reed
and Cannon in recognizing only
those to whom he wishes to
give the floor.
BACK TO SPEAKER
Thus, after many years, power
has shifted back to the
Speaker. But Rayburn is not
Cannon. The friendly and conciliatory Texan does not secure
his ends by arbitrary means but
by private persuasion and compromise. His potential power
will make him a powerful mediator.
In the new Senate the "revolt" of the Republican liberal
was nipped in the bud. Taft
and Wherry retain their ascendancy. There were grave
weaknesses in the revolt. Taft
is no reactionary. His voting
record and his sponsorship of
legislation are as liberal as
those of most of his opponents.
His record is, in fact, more constructive than most because
he has never failed to make
clear that he has a real program
for which he is ready to fight.
HAD NO PROGRAM
It was a fundamental weakness of the liberal group which
opposed him that they presented
no program of their own.
That, however, would have been
exceedingly difficult, since it
would be hard to get agreement
between such Senators as Morse
and Saltonstall or Aiken and
Ives.
If in this Congress there is
to be a Republican record which
might in 1950 reverse the defeat of 1948, Taft will loom
large in its creation. For his intelligence, courage and industry
will stand out once more as
constructive forces in a body
in which those qualities are not
too common.
