Truman Plan Borrows
False Marxian Premise
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If President Truman were a
dictator, able to enforce his
recommendations, we should
have what the Russians call a
"gosplan" â€” an idea widely
copied in Europe, even in Socialist Britain. The state of the
Union message, the budget and
the report of the economic advisers all fall into a pattern.
Our plan, however, pays some
polite respects to private enterprise, which must foot the bills
for any plan. And we have a
Congress which will view with
much doubt any effort to remodel our affairs on European
plans.
A basic assumption in the
Truman economic philosophy is
that the business cycle is man-made. This was a Marxian invention. But it also appeared
in Roosevelt's speech of acceptance in 1932. It means that
by interposing the hand of government in economic life we
can avoid depressions, recessions and booms.
HAD THEM ANYHOW
Despite much government interference in Roosevelt years,
however, we had a recession
and in the past three years we
have had a boom. But the idea
still persists that if we give
government enough power we
shall avoid such excesses.
A basic characteristic of economic planning is the fixing of
"goals." Truman specifies these
goals and warns private business that if they are not attained government will step in
and make them good.
The goals set by the President, with some trimmings independently presented by Leon
Keyserling, a member of his
Council of Economic Advisers,
are these:
The facts of our employment
for 1948 add up to about
61,000,000, including more than
2,000,000 in military service.
The goal for 1949 is about
62,500,000, including an increase
of 1,000,000 in civilian employment.
FACTS VS. GOALS
The fact of gross national
product for 1948 is about
$250,000,000,000. The 1949
"goal" is about $260,000,000,000.
The fact of 1948 national income
is over $220,000,000,000. The
1949 "goal" is over $225,000,000,000.
The fact of private investment in 1948 is nearly $50,000,000,000. Public works for 1948
were $3,000,000,000. The "goal"
for 1949 is the same total, but
since private investment will
probably be less, this means
enough more for public works
to fill the gap.
The fact of Federal receipts in
1948, including Social Security,
was around $43,000,000,000.
The "goal" for 1949 is about
$48,000,000,000 and probably
more.
These "goals" look fine. If
by putting some figures on paper and by inducing Congress
to pass a few laws we can thus
increase our national product
and income, how can anyone
complain if we take an additional $5,000,000,000 or so for government?
CAN IT BE DONE?
The difficulty is to make it
reasonably certain that the 1948
level of business can be maintained by any "man-made"
effort.
It is difficult to believe that
consumer expenditure will rise
as is essential to these goals. It
is almost absolutely sure that
profits and investments in private business will be lower in
1949. A good judge of business
trends, Mr. Stagg Lawrence,
says that gross private investment, including producers, durable goods and construction,
will fall between 10 and 20%
below the $40,000,000,000 of
1948.
The real issue is whether in
the face of that private decline,
public works, even if authorized,
can get under way with sufficient speed to fill the gap. All
past experience tells us that
it cannot be done.
