What have we given to for-
eign countries since the war
and what have we received in
return?
In round figures we computed,
in 1946, 1947 and 1948, about
$52,000,000,000 in goods and
services; and we have received
$26,000,000,000 in return. Thus,
the amount of our product that
we have seen flow out without
return has been $26,000,000,000.
This means about 12% of our
national product. It means also
that nearly 3,000,000 Americans
have been working to produce
those exports, for which we
shall probably get no return
either in goods or money.
Such pouring out to foreign
nations has never been seen
before. After the first World
War the Germans were told to
work off and give a period of
20 years. Of course, they failed
to deliver. Before the first
World War the British worked
a great deal for export, but
they were paid handsomely for
what they did. They received
in return 20% of their imports
free.
Foreign trade in the past has
involved such a small part of
our economy that we scarcely
understand the implications of
is new situation. We only
guely appreciate what our
giving has meant to us. But it
has been a severe drain on our
sources. To make it possible,
we have been compelled deliberately
to raise our cost of living.
We have had to deprive our
coal and iron consuming industries
to make shipments by road. A
year ago we cut short the grain
supply needed to maintain our
domestic animals. When we
studied economics we were always
correctly taught that a continuing
excess of exports over imports was
unsound. British prewar practice
was always against an excess,
except, of course, when a substantial
profit could be obtained for
investment in foreign revenue-producing
properties.
Our present course is justified
by our statesmen on the ground
that we are plowing in money
to produce good will. That is
often good business practice, but
only when future profitable
markets are assured. Such future
markets are highly speculative.
For good will is a perishable
product, and some of our export
gifts have gone down a bottomless
pit.
Whatever went to China is lost.
What went beyond the Iron
Curtain is certainly not used for
our advantage. And from Germany
we receive in return only bitter
complaints.
In other European countries
the sentiment is developing that
we are making these huge loans
and gifts because we must do so
in order to keep our people employed.
Thus, they say, we must get rid
of our surplus in order to prevent
depression and unrest at home.
And thus we should be grateful
to Germans, Austrians and Japanese
because they relieve us of our surplus
goods.
We have, however, kept Communism
down in France and Italy. We
are on the way to Western European
union, whatever that may be worth.
And we have advertised our industrial
know-how sufficiently to encourage
other countries to improve their
own production. But as those countries
recover, we shall have to consider
ways and means to receive larger
imports from them. For an excess
of exports must ultimately be paid
in imports, and we shall be a poorer
and perhaps a sadder nation.
