Taft-Hartley Act
Holds Its Own
in 81st Congress
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The "hum's rush" that the
administration and the labor
leaders planned to give the
Taft-Hartley Act simply didn't
happen. The first phase of the
struggle has decidedly gone
against the opponents of the
act. The prospect for a repeal
is much darker than it was two
months ago. In fact the whole
offensive against the work of
the 80th Congress reached its
climax in the giddy days after
election.
The purple and gold image
which hovered over the November
miracle has faded. In
a parliamentary way we are
about where we were toward
the end of the 79th Congress.
The difference is that the 80th
Congress passed several basic
pieces of legislation. And it is
usually harder to repeal than
to pass.
Since the Senate Democrats
have abandoned their plan to
cut short the hearings on a new
labor law, they now can look
back at the folly of that frustrated
strategy. Speed would
have been dangerous to all concerned,
especially to the labor
leaders and the Democrats.
DANGER OF HASTE
The sponsors of new legislation
would have been held
responsible for subsequent
events. Even a mild outbreak
of spring strikes would have
had regrettable effects on the
Truman prestige. The longer
a repeal is delayed, the milder
the next outbreak of strikes.
What we are getting is a
"cooling-off" period not anticipated
in the Truman strategy.
It is probable that we shall
get another labor act, and the
name "Taft-Hartley" will disappear.
That is perhaps just
as well for Republican prospects,
since the labor boys have
been spraying this Taft-Hartley
rose with so much smelly stuff
that another name would help.
But the new act, whatever its
name, will probably be more
like Taft-Hartley than Wagner.
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
There would have been a
better chance for quick repeal
if the labor people had undertaken
to give reassurance that
there would be no serious round
of strikes this spring. But they
were confident that they could
have the law and the strikes,
too. They were intoxicated by
the unexpected November success.
Sometimes, the cycle of wage
increases must end, and it
looks now as if in several industries
wage increases are already
stopped.
Sen. Taft is not going to be
injured by name-calling. The
United Mine Workers may call
him a Lucifer, but the public
won't go along with such billingsgate.
Bitterness, recrimination
and diatribe are not the
means of getting laws passed.
The unions would be well advised
to use more moderation.
Congressmen must not be talked
to as if they were mere employers.
NO SUBSTITUTE
The dilemma faced by the
administration is that, while it
must admit that certain strikes
can paralyze the nation and
that the President must have
some power to bring relief, it
can produce no convincing substitute
for the Taft-Hartley
remedy.
The "implicit power" of the
President to get injunctions,
which Atty. Gen. Clark suggested,
has raised too many
questions. It has been hard to
answer Taft's question: "If the
President has such power and
it is necessary, why not keep
it in specific terms in the law?"
This is common sense speaking
in answer to a political gesture
designed to satisfy all sides of
an issue.
That leaves only the suggestion,
once made by Truman, of
drafting recalcitrant workers
into the Army. That is an
antique French device, as fictitious
as seizures.
Perhaps, while Gov. Dewey
and others are talking about
the disunity of Republicans,
that defeated party is finding
new life through Democratic
dilemmas.
