The President Has Advisers
to Suit Each Political Shift
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Back in the years when this
writer was a member of the
first Roosevelt administration,
the term "Presidential advisers"
was used to characterize an in-
determinate group of people
who had more or less casual
access to the President.
Some were regularly em-
ployed in the government, but
had a sort of privileged access
to the President. Presidential
advisers in Roosevelt's time
were constantly changing, ac-
cording to the capricious moods
and interests of the President.
Some advisers, like Baruch, had
no official status at all in those
days, and their advice was taken
or left alone, as the President
wished.
THE ROOSEVELT CHANGE
It became clear, even in those
days, that the Cabinet and such
people as the Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, traditionally known as Presidential
advisers, had ceased to have
much advisory status. As department heads, they were busy
men. They hardly had continuous access to the President.
Cabinet meetings were usually
perfunctory affairs, with the
President and two or three
people doing all the talking.
There has always been real
need for people immediately accessible to the President who
have no administrative duties
and who have time to think
rather than act.
Presidential advisers, however, must adapt themselves to
several conditions not entirely
compatible with cold, scientific
research. A President must
balance many interests. He
must veer from left to right.
He must set his sails to variable
political winds. He must use
advisers, not altogether to tell
him what to do, but to give him
facts and arguments to justify
various and often contradictory
policies. Hence, there must be
advisers of the left, of the
right, and of the middle of the
road.
TRUMAN'S COUNCIL
It was a grandiose scheme
which brought about the creation of the present Council of
Economic Advisers in 1946. Advisers were to have official
status, salaries, offices and facilities for research. They were
given the job of long-time
predictionsâ€”a job which no one
could do with much success.
In selecting his Council
President Truman has sought
a balance. Since things seemed
to be veering to the right two
years ago, the chairmanship of
the Council went to Prof. E. G.
Nourse, a Republican with
moderately conservative views.
To balance him, there is Leon
Keyserling, a former assistant
to Sen. Wagner and a man with
leftist leanings.
In the theoretical middle is
John D. Clark, a former professor and a Democrat. Clark is
supposed to represent the moderate ground. In fact, his position seems to be whatever
the Truman policies represent
at any given time.
WHICH ONE?
Hence, when the question
arises about what the President's advisers think about this
or that, it is well to ask, "Which
adviser?" and when we try to
predict the course of public
policy by peering into the minds
of the advisers, we must remember that the President may
select the advice that fits his
needs. He has, in short, a wide
range of selection.
It has been apparent since
the election that the Keyserling
side has become stronger than
the Nourse influence. And it
has been apparent, too, that
far from being a mere privy
council for the President, the
advisers are speaking openly
to Congress and the public and
are engaged in selling their
views, however divergent they
may be.
