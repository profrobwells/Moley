Free Education
Is Unlikely With
U.S. Subsidies
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Huey Long used to tell about
the "scrooch owl" that snuggled
up to a hen perched on a chilly
roost. "And," concluded Long,
"pooty soon there warn't no
hen."
The fate of the hen may well
overtake our educational system,
if the Federal government
succeeds in its purpose of subsidizing
the public schools of the
States.
This issue is real and imminent.
Two vast proposals are now
pending. The one is a bill to
"equalize educational opportunities"
in the States. The other,
embodied in the report of the
President's Commission on
Higher Education, proposes a
huge Federal subsidy for a
planned mass education, from
the high school level up.
IN THE BUDGET
The President's budget contained
an item of $414,000,000 for
education and general research,
which represents an increase of
$329,000,000 over the current
year. This addition is largely a
grant to the States for their
schools. The President's request
runs in line with the proposal of
Sen. Taft and several colleagues
in the last Congress for $300,000,000
for State education.
Sen. Taft, who has a high sense
of constitutional propriety, confesses
that for years he doubted the
wisdom of such a subsidy. But he
has now embraced the policy.
It is generally recognized by
the advocates of Federal school
subsidies that Federal control of
the teaching policies and methods
of our schools is inimical to
American principles. This was
recognized when in our Constitution
public education was expressly
reserved to the States.
THE SLOGAN
But, say the advocates of this
subsidy, Federal aid does not
mean Federal control. In fact, in
all the voluminous publicity of
the NEA and other groups, the
slogan is "Federal aid without
Federal control."
The insistence upon these defensive
words is, in fact, a confession
that the separation of aid from
control is difficult. It is impossible.
Sen. Taft, in defending his bill
last year, devoted a major part of
his attention to this point. He
stated that all the Federal government
could do under his bill
would be to "audit" the expenditure
of the funds. One section of
his bill spreads out in some 200
words a prohibition of any Federal
interference or control. "That
language," said Taft, "is as strong
as we can write it." That is
probably true. And it is also
probably true that no one else
could write it any better.
BUT THE DOUBTS
But it does not resolve the
doubts of many intelligent people
who say that there can never be a
Federal subsidy that does not
involve some control. And that in
the course of time, control, like
sin, "we first endure, then pity,
then embrace."
When it is claimed that an "audit"
does not involve "control," the
answer is that "audit" is "control."
That is why an audit in a business
is a means by which a board of
directors keeps control of its
company. In the law setting up
the duties of the Comptroller
General of the United States,
Congress specified that he should
"investigate" all matters relating
to the expenditure of public funds.
And anyone familiar with the methods
of bureaucracy knows what pressures,
indirect and otherwise, can be put
on those who enjoy government
bounty.
There might be no such danger in
limiting subsidies to grants for the
physical plants or equipment of
schools. But any extension of Federal
power over teachers, texts or courses
of study would ultimately result in
waste, inefficiency, deadly uniformity
and the control of opinion by
government.
