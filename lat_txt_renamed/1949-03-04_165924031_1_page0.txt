March 4, formerly a mile-
stone in our national march of
time, is now just another day.
But there is a special reason
why we may pause for reflec-
tion on this 16th anniversary of
the first Roosevelt inaugura-
tion. Members of the adminis-
tration, no doubt infected by
the same cocky state of mind
that characterizes the Presi-
dent's public utterances, are
talking about "another hundred
days." They mean that once
more there is under way a
great surge of reform such as
characterized the unprecedented
early weeks of the New Deal.
It is hard to see how they
can find any parallel, for the
cold facts are against them.
Their new Congress has been in
session two months, and noth-
ing of importance has happened.
Two months after March 4, 1933,
a tremendous mass of legisla-
tion had been passed and more
was ready for a final vote.
THE EXTRA SESSION
Congress met in extra session
at noon on March 9, 1933, re-
ceived the President's request
for emergency banking legisla-
tion and passed the accompany-
ing bill before the day was
over. The next day a drastic
economy program went to the
Hill and was enacted 10 days
later. From then on, for weeks,
Congress counted the day lost
when a new message calling for
legislation or the news of new,
sweeping executive orders did
not reach it.
Among the March Presiden-
tial demands which were enact-
ed were the restoration of beer
and wine, the Agricultural Ad-
justment Act, unemployment
relief and Federal supervision
of investment securities.
In April there followed pro-
posals for farm mortgage legis-
lation, the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority, small homes mortgage
relief, emergency railroad legis-
lation.
All these were passed either
immediately or before Congress
adjourned in June. More came
in May and were passed. Wash-
ington had never seen and per-
haps will never again see such
expedition.
IMPOTENT TRUMAN
Despite the pleas of current
majority leaders in Congress
that things are really happen-
ing, the whole Truman pro-
gram is about where it was two
months ago. His labor bill is
facing decisive opposition and
drastic revision. Demands for
tax increases have been put on
ice by Messrs. George and
Doughton. Civil rights legisla-
tion faces a paralyzing filibus-
ter; housing legislation is only
beginning its course; health
legislation has been introduced
but has only a remote chance;
and various so-called anti-infla-
tion measures are fading out in
the light of lower prices.
The President, despite chip-
per and aggressive talk, is im-
potent in the face of Congres-
sional opposition and indiffer-
ence. And, what is more, the
golden early weeks that have
always been the fruitful honey-
moon of a newly elected Presi-
dent are slipping away. Still
confident in his newly discov-
ered oratorical power, the Presi-
dent threatens to take his case
to the country. That would be
an onerous and rather desper-
ate expedient. It was one thing
to swing through the States de-
nouncing the 80th Congress. It
will be quite another to preach
a crusade against the 81st Con-
gress.
BASIC DIFFERENCE
Perhaps the basic difference
between 1933 and 1949 is this:
in 1933 there was only one way
to go. Prices, production and
confidence were at a low ebb.
Upward and onward were the
watchwords.
Now, despite outward expres-
sions of confidence, the Presi-
dent and his advisers cannot set
their direction because they do
not and cannot know the pro-
spective economic weather. The
program that they are sponsor-
ing was improvised in the heat
of a campaign and a period of
unprecedented inflation. The
weather signals are different
now, and there is no positive
certainty of the future. Con-
gress, also in doubt, can afford
to wait. And wait it probably
will while the President as-
sumes an air of confidence that
cannot be felt very deeply.
