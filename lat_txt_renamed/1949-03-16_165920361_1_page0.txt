Pyramid Club
Old Delusion
in a New Form
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The widespread craze called
pyramid should remind us once
more of a frightening fact. Despite
our immense expenditures
on education, Americans
still live in the black, dripping
caves of economic superstition.
All that is needed is a dazzling
illusion of easy gain expressed
by a master of word magic,
and millions of good people forget
all their lessons.
Perhaps in a moment in which
taxes come due and we are
reminded of the billions of dollars
that are being redistributed
in the solemn name of
law, we can spare little sympathy
for the redistribution of
a few tens of thousands by the
game of pyramid.
HOW IT WORKS
But the popeyed sincerity
with which otherwise reliable
housewives and breadwinners
tell you that they can make
$2048 out of $1 should give
some of us pause.
Is it, after all, worthwhile
to tell people unpleasant
truth? What boots it with incessant
toil to produce and
save, when by yielding to illusions
we can live and maybe
die in happy anticipation?
We all now know how pyramid
works, or is supposed to
work. Charlie McCarthy gets
two Mortimer Snerds to get
two more Mortimer Snerds to
get two more, etc., etc., until
256 Mortimer Snerds bring $8
each, and then somebody gets
$2048. That is, if the breed of
Snerds holds out.
FROM THE BEGINNING
The science of economics has
been infected from the beginning
with illusions almost as
absurd as this. For economics
is only in part a science of actual
money and units of work
or capital. It is in large part a
speculative art, dependent not
upon fact but upon what some
people may think is fact.
John Law, the greatest of
economic soothsayers, practiced
his magic nearly two and
a half centuries ago. It is interesting
that he was a Scotch
economist who practiced in
France. He convinced the
French government which was,
of course, politically minded,
that people could be persuaded
that paper money secured by
the generality of land, resources
and inhabitants that
constituted France would be
accepted for the payment of
debts and the exchange of
goods.
LAW'S SUCCESSORS
The government, infected by
its own propaganda, later
agreed to accept this money
in payment for taxes. A succession
of banks was created,
each with a more majestic
name. There was the first the
"General Bank," then the "Company
of Canada," the "Company
of Louisiana or of the
Occident," the "Company of the
East Indies and of China," and
the "Company of India." The
wildest and most fantastic
speculation arose and after
four years collapsed.
Law's successors are active.
They tell us that the bigger our
budget, the safer we are from
economic disaster; that if at the
same time we spend more and
also cancel more of our debt,
our economy will be in balance.
We are told that the production
of goods to give away
will add to our national wealth;
that this government or any
government can direct the production
of a nation. So far,
there seem to be enough believers
to sustain these illusions.
So far, our national pyramid
is not resting on its apex. So
far.
