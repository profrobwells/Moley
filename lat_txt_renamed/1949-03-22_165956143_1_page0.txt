Private Capital
Is Not Eager
to Go Abroad
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

We have been hearing little
these last two months about
President Truman's nice little
inaugural sermon about devel-
oping backward countries. He
has had other legislative fish to
fry, and some of them seem to
have been badly burned in the
process.
But the idea of developing
the underdeveloped is still a
lively idea among the economic
bureaucrats in Washington.
SUNSHINE OF DOLLAR
In one of the departments
where people are already plan-
ning "Operation Underdevel-
oped," a man was asked to
name the prospective bene-
ficiaries of this new beneficence.
It was easier, he said, to name
the developed and lump the
rest. North America, of course,
is developed, and perhaps Aus-
tralia and Japan. Europe be-
longs to "Operation Marshall."
All the rest, therefore, is un-
derdeveloped. Russia is under-
developed, and for security rea-
sons some hope it will stay that
way.
But the rest of the globe is
waiting for the sunshine of the
dollar. How thrilling!
The United Nations has been
going into all this. Perhaps Mrs.
Roosevelt helped Mr. Truman
with his speech. At any rate,
a subcommittee of the Eco-
nomic and Social Council of the
United Nations has turned out
two volumes on the subject,
and a two-week session of this
committee began yesterday.
In the materials already as-
sembled by this U.N. commit-
tee many matters have been
outlinedâ€”the training of ex-
perts abroad, the setting up of
"teams" of experts in the U.S.
international laboratories, pro-
vision of equipment and sup-
plies, and all that sort of thing.
CAPITAL'S FEARS
The Truman idea, however,
rested on the notion that pri-
vate capital could be called upon
for this missionary work. Some-
one, no doubt, told him that it
was British and Dutch private
capital that brought great civ-
ilizing influence to underde-
veloped India, Indonesia and the
like many years ago. But no
one, apparently, told him that
such ventures were attended by
heavy military protection and
yielded profits which the gov-
ernments permitted private capi-
tal to retain.
Profits are now under attack.
Venture capital is practically
outlawed. And the Democratic
Party is still screaming about
the 1920 adventures of Amer-
ican capital abroad.
As a result, American pri-
vate capital has a violent fear
of seasickness. John Maynard
Keynes estimated in 1923 that
private English loans to public
authorities abroad had been de-
faulted to the extent of 60%.
Moreover, due to exchange re-
strictions American investments
abroad are greatly handicapped
in bringing profits home.
The planners are suggesting
that to overcome private fears
our government might offer
guarantees to American inves-
tors and exact guarantees of free
exchange from foreign govern-
ments. But these latter guar-
antees are doubtful. They
might be good as long as the
governments in those countries
remained the same and the dol-
lars for transfer were available.
It might well be that in the
end the American taxpayer
might himself choose to migrate
to some happy but underdevel-
oped land. And leave America
to the United Nations, the bu-
reaucrats and to the happily
protected but underdeveloped
American Indians.
