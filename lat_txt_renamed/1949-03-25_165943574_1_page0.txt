It's John L.
Against the
Business Cycle
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The new John L. Lewis
amendment to the Constitution
of the United States opens up
amazing possibilities.
The amendment now enacted
provides that whenever a name
is submitted to the Senate of the
United States for appointment
to a Federal office which is dis-
pleasing, it shall be the privilege
of the dissatisfied person to quit
work and remain idle until the
Senate acts on said appointment.
Such indeed is the import of the
Lewis memorial holiday for
miners which was declared in
protest against the nomination
of Dr. James Boyd to be director
of the Federal Bureau of Mines.
Dr. Boyd's nomination has been
confirmed, but that does not
close out the possibilities of the
method.
HIS REAL REASON
It is a very interesting method
of providing a new check upon
the President and the Senate.
Some of us wish that we might
employ it not only as a means
of justifying a vacation during
these dull spring days, but to
offer our protest against some
of the President's recent appointments.
The nomination of
the Hon. Mon Wallgren should
have been the signal for several
days' national mourning, with
time to repair to our several
houses of worship to pray for
the future of our nation.
However, John L. Lewis always
has a real reason as well
as a pious reason for his decisions.
His assumption of power
to veto Federal appointments
is a minor objective. That is in
the realm of constitutional law.
His real reason is to bend the
business cycle to fit the Lewis
objectives.
To build up any possible basis
for further increases in wages
and benefits for his miners, he
must stop the present "disinflation"
and produce rising prices.
The weather and greater productivity
have been increasing
the supplies of coal and threatening
coal prices. Only a work
stoppage can reduce that coal
pile and prepare the way for the
real thrust later on.
MAY MEET MASTER
The reported Lewis demand
for a 35-hour week, with pay
for 40 and an increase in royalties
on coal for the payment of
miners' pensions, might be
equal to an increase in wages
of almost 30 cents an hour. This
would, if it succeeds, be an inflationary
force of some consequence
all along the line. It
would, moreover, strengthen the
hands of other labor leaders
who are with some misgivings
contemplating further wage demands.
In this attack on the business
cycle, Lewis will not have much
opposition from the Truman administration.
This time the objective
of Lewis fits into the administration's
objective of promoting a "little"
more inflation.
It remains to be seen whether
this Lewis attack on declining
prices and employment can succeed.
A reduction of two weeks'
production would still leave a
normal surplus of coal of about
45,000,000 tons. In the rest of
the economy conditions are
moving into a buyer's market.
Oil production is being gently
checked. Stocks of manufactured
goods are in supply.
Bumper crops are in prospect.
Unemployment is inching up.
Lewis may find that the vast,
impersonal power of supply and
demand is a more formidable opponent
than a politically minded
government.
