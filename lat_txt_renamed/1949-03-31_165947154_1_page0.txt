Taft Faces a Fight in 1950,
and Bricker Could Help Him
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
To visit Ohio these spring
days is to realize that political
speculation, sharply interrupt-
ed after the November election,
is again a subject of major in-
terest. Much of this specula-
tion, in Ohio as elsewhere in
the country, concerns the po-
litical future of Sen. Robert A.
Taft.
The Senator must run again
in 1950, and he and his friends
realize that he will have the
fight of his life. He has clearly
and without much thought of
political consequences taken a
firm stand on many questions.
Consequently, he has antago-
nized a number of minority
groups.
AS A VOTE-GETTER
The State Republican organ-
ization is in not too happy a
situation. Labor will go all out
to defeat the sponsor of Taft-
Hartley. And despite the fact
that a great deal of support
could be poured into Ohio from
people outside the State who
admire Taft, such help is al-
ways prejudicial to a local can-
didate.
Finally, Taft has never been
a big vote-getter. In his two
campaigns for the Senate he
was successful, but his mar-
gin, especially in 1944, was not
large. He won a sweeping vic-
tory over Stassen in the 1948
primary, however.
It has been widely believed
in Ohio that Taft's opponent in
1950 would be Frank Lausche,
the very popular two-time Gov-
ernor of Ohio. Recently, how-
ever, speculation has turned to
the idea that Lausche may
want to run for Governor again
and thus in 1952 be in a better
position to be nominated on
the national ticket.
LAUSCHE'S AMBITION
Lausche is a Catholic, and it
is considered more likely that
he will aim at the Vice-Presi-
dency than at the first place.
The Governorship would be a
much better step to national
honors than the Senate for
Lausche, because as a new Sen-
ator he could hardly build much
of a national reputation in one
year.
On the other hand, the form
of the Ohio ballot has some-
thing to do with the prospects.
The candidates for Governor
head the ticket, while Sena-
torial candidates are down
among the small fry. If Lausche
should run for Governor again,
he would draw a lot of votes
for the Democratic Senatorial
candidate, whoever he might
be, and Taft's problem would
be just about as difficult as
with Lausche running for the
Senate.
At this point an interesting
idea has suggested itself to Re-
publicans. John W. Bricker is
the most tremendous harvester
of votes that Ohio has seen in
a generation. He is said to be
not particularly happy in the
Senate. He is essentially an
administrator.
If, it is said, he could be per-
suaded to run for Governor,
the Republican ticket would be
in wonderful shape and Taft's
chances would be excellent, re-
gardless of the decision Lausche
makes. Bricker could make
such a run and still hold his
Senate seat, because his term
runs until 1953.
