President Truman is said to
have complained bitterly to
members of the Hoover Com-
mission that he is having a
hard time getting good men to
take big jobs in this govern-
ment. If this be true, it is un-
fortunate for him and for the
country.
'It is strange, however, con-
sidering the fact that he is a
freshly inaugurated President
and can offer nearly four years
of tenure and an opportunity to
work with a Congress which
at least bears the same party
label as the Chief Executive.
The situation cannot be blamed
entirely upon the salary sched-
ule, because other Presidents
have had that handicap and
have done better in their selec-
tions than has Truman.
GOVERNOR'S SECRET
A very successful Governor
of a State once said that the
secret of a good chief executive
is to persuade $50,000 men to
work in government for $10,000.
And that particular Governor
was able to do just that.
Perhaps the trouble lies
with the President himself. He
is evidently a man who cannot
select his appointees confidently
unless he has known them
closely for a long time. He has
an affinity for old cronies. He
has filled highly important posi-
tions with people with no par-
ticular qualifications for their
jobs, just because he likes to
have them around. And then
he is hurt because they fail to
impress the public with their
brilliance or competence.
The mark of a great execu-
tive is his capacity to pick
strangers successfully. He de-
velops a means of finding out
about people, of discovering
budding talent among young
and comparatively unknown
men, of checking on their quali-
fications and of weighing the
data he assembles. A great ex-
ecutive also has a means of
checking against his own preju-
dices and predilections. He has
to learn how to trust and un-
derstand people whom he has
not known.
Since the President seems to
lack this ability, his appoint-
ments, especially since the be-
ginning of his new term, have
not been inspiring. The Wall-
gren selection was most unfor-
tunate. The appointment of
Louis Johnson as Defense Sec-
retary was based on party serv-
ice at a time when no one ex-
pected that Truman would be
elected. This is commendable
as loyalty, but it hardly quali-
fies a man for the third biggest
job in Washington. Dean Ache-
son was nearby, had some State
Department experience, and the
President knew him. But his
capacities are not up to the
traditions of the office.
The net result is that the
level of this administration is
getting down close to medioc-
rity. And in the years ahead
this is going to be increasingly
evident. That is most regretta-
ble, because these are unusual
times which need unusual men.
