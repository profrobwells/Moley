Easing Brakes
Is Not Enough
to Start Uphill
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While the views of a large
assortment of businessmen,
gathered by this reporter on a
trip to Ohio, Illinois and Texas,
indicate a mild decline in many
sectors of our economy, the
President and some of his eco-
nomic advisers seem to think
we are still fighting inflation.
Disagreement within the
President's Council of Economic
Advisers seems to be swinging
toward a victory for those who
believe that Truman's anti-infla-
tion program of some months
ago is still appropriate to the
economic scene.
Edwin G. Nourse's more
realistic and conservative views
have been pushed aside by
Leon H. Keyserling and John
D. Clark.
PASSING AMMUNITION
The Keyserling-Clark view
seems to be that after the President decides, for political or
other reasons, that certain
measures should be taken, the
council should provide him
with plausible arguments for
his decision.
And that is not all. The Keyserling-Clark view is that the
economic system can be guided
and controlled to fit any trend
that is deemed politically advantageous to the administration.
In other words, that if a
continued inflation is desirable,
the government should throw
the inflation switch. If, later
on, a little deflation seems
needed, the switch should be
turned to that.
REVERSIBLE LEVER
A serious part of this delusion is that it seems to be assumed that to fight deflation
it is merely necessary to turn
inflation controls in the opposite direction. This theory overlooks the fact that while you
can put on brakes to slow a
car, you cannot accelerate a car
by taking off the brakes—unless you are going downhill.
And if we liken natural economic forces to a road with
ups and downs, we are never
going down a hill when we
want to accelerate. On the level
or on the upgrade it takes power, not merely the releasing of
brakes.
But while Truman still wants
power to control inflation and
still is determined to raise
taxes, he is now willing to admit that he would like to have
stand-by power to control deflation. In short, the President
tells Congress to give him a lot
of powers—powers for anything
—brakes, accelerator, steering
gear, etc.
A NEW BOND SALE
The trouble is that with all
these powers he would still be
short on information. Certainly, this is shown by the fact
that parts of his administration
do not seem to know what other
parts are doing. Or they are
acting upon different sorts of
information.
The Treasury, for example,
is getting up a campaign to sell
savings bonds in May. This is
supposed to be anti-inflationary.
However, if we are on a gentle
downgrade—and we seem to
be—we should be telling the
public to spend more and save
less.
The economic system can survive this tinkering, of course.
But it is a bit confusing to a
public which pays plenty of
taxes to provide proper information for its government.
