U.S. Watchmakers' Case
for Some Tariff Protection
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the various American
industries that will claim pro-
tection as Europe increases its
production, our watch industry
can make a very special case.
In a sense, that industry was
a war hero. Without help, it
may become a peace casualty.
When this country gave prior-
ity to defense and later to war,
the American watch industry
was drafted for precision in-
struments of various kinds.
Watchmakers virtually discon-
tinued manufacturing for the
civilian market. At the end of
the war, Swiss competition had
largely taken over. Swiss
watches imported into the Unit-
ed States in 1934 numbered
830,000. In 1948 this number
had risen tenfold. In 1931-35
the Swiss share of the Ameri-
can market was 47%; in 1948
it was 77%. The loss of the
market during the war has been
projected through nearly four
years of peace.
In the American industry
there are three sorts of enter-
prises: importers who bring fin-
ished watches almost exclusive-
ly from Switzerland; firms that
import movements and other
parts and assemble the finished
product for our market; Ameri-
can firms that make the entire
watch here. Some American
firms have branch establish-
ments in Europe; others com-
bine assembling here with home
production.
PROFITS FOR TWO
American firms have had
varying degrees of success since
the end of the war. Two old
and distinguished firms—Ham-
ilton and Elgin—showed a good
profit last year, although Ham-
ilton fell off somewhat from
1947. Waltham has had very se-
rious trouble not altogether at-
tributable to foreign competi-
tion. It has been able to effect
a reorganization through the
aid of an RFC loan. The U.S.
Time Corp. in Waterbury has
laid off more than 2000 workers
since August of last year.
The general situation in con-
sumer buying has affected
watches as well as other lines.
Watch sales last month were
more than 15% less than in the
same month last year.
LABOR COST HIGH
In the watch business there
is close co-operation between
the companies and the union
in urging protection against
cheaper European production.
It has been pointed out that
wages in Switzerland, figured
in American money, are about
half of those in the United
States.
The labor differential is ex-
tremely important in the watch
business, since labor accounts
for more than half the cost of
making a watch.
Since we are approaching a
decline in employment, it may
be expected that organized la-
bor will become more and more
concerned with competition
with cheaper wages abroad. The
more ardent advocates of tariff
protection will ultimately be
the leaders of labor, especially
in highly skilled trades like
watchmaking.
