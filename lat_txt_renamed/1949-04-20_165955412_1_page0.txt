Project to Put Government
in the Telephone Business
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A sound rule in judging the
desirability of passing a law is
to determine in advance the
answers to two questions: Is
the matter to be corrected some-
thing which will adjust itself
without the interference of gov-
ernment? Will the govern-
ment's action correct the situa-
tion or raise new and more
serious problems?
These questions apply with
serious force to the Pogue bill
now before Congress, which is
designed to project public
ownership and co-operatives
into the telephone business
The bill provides that the Rural
Electrification Administration
shall be authorized to make
loans for the supplying of tele-
phone service in rural areas
which now have little or no
such facilities.
THEORY AND PRACTICE
Preference in granting these
loans would be to private com-
panies, but in effect if a private
company should deem it unwise
to borrow government money
to conserve a given area, public
agencies such as municipalities
and co-operatives would be able
to get low interest loans and
move into the telephone busi-
ness. Thus, private companies
would be faced with the alter-
native of either doing some-
thing that their business pru-
dence forbids them to do or
seeing developed a type of
government-supported competi-
tion which might seriously in-
jure them and possibly end in
their own absorption by gov-
ernment.
The companies which have
appeared before Congress in
opposition to the bill have
pointed out a number of con-
siderations which make this
proposal not only unnecessary
but dangerous.
RURAL TELEPHONES
In the first place, private
companies have been extend-
ing their services to rural re-
gions at a remarkable rate.
In a total of nearly 6,000,000
farms it is estimated by the
government that about 42%
have telephones this year.
That compares with 25% in
1940. Thus, private compa-
nies, despite the war and short-
ages of material, for which
they are not responsible, have
made and are making tremen-
dous strides in supplying serv-
ice. Since the end of the war
more than 1,000,000 rural tele-
phones have been installed.
It should be noted that the
loans would be made by the
REA, which in the past has
shown a tremendous inclination
to lend to co-operatives. Ac-
cording to the Hoover Com-
mission, only 21 loans for rural
electrification have been made
to private power companies,
but public power agencies have
received 61 and co-operatives,
952.
The same trend would un-
doubtedly appear in the tele-
phone business if this bill were
passed. Co-operatives would
not only have a great advan-
tage in getting loans, but be-
cause of their relief from heavy
taxation they would have an
immense and unfair competi-
tive advantage over private
companies.
