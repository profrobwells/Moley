Advantages of 5% U.S. Cut
Straight Across the Board
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The proposal to cut the costs
of all Federal bureaus, depart-
ments and activities by a hori-
zontal 5%, now meeting favor
among.conservative Democrats
as well as Republicans, has sev-
eral advantages.
It is simple, it is reassuring
to the country, and it is fairly
equitable to all services con-
cerned. It puts the burden on
each agency to apply the cut.
And everyone familiar with the
padding of budget requests by
bureaucrats knows that such a
cut will not result in the pub-
lic's loss of any essential serv-
ice.
Moreover, under conditions as
they are now in Congress, with
unfinished business piled up
everywhere and no major legis-
lation yet enacted, and with a
real impasse between the Presi-
dent and the GOP- Dixiecrat
coalition, this over-all cut is
about all that can be done.
POSSIBLE SAVING
Since several immense pro-
posals, such as arms for West-
ern Europe, which involve bil-
lions, may be added to the
President's earlier budget, the
total cost of our Federal gov-
ernment in the year beginning
in July may run close to $50,-
000,000,000. The 5% cut, there-
fore, would save nearly $2,500,-
000,000 and cover five-eighths
of Truman's proposed tax in-
crease.
The taxpayer, who has at-
tained the mood in which he is
thankful for very small favors
indeed, should realize that such
a small horizontal cut is a clear
confession by Congress that it
has failed utterly in achieving
any really constructive budget
action. It has failed to live up
to its own rule, adopted in 1946,
to produce a legislative budget
by May 1.
The simple and appalling fact
is that the Federal government
is completely out of financial
control. The thing is so big
and so complex that methods
of control established when we
were spending one-tenth of
present amounts are not ade-
quate for the task. We are all
like passengers in a bus which
is rolling down a steep hill
with brakes built long ago for
a vehicle one-tenth its size.
The Hoover Commission
pointed out in a remarkable re-
port that the present Budget
Bureau, which has grown enor-
mously in personnel, is not or-
ganized to provide the Presi-
dent with real control over ex-
penditures. The Controller Gen-
eral, who could be of great
help to the appropriations com-
mittees of Congress, is swamped
in a mass of accounting which
should be shifted to the Treas-
ury.
What Congress can do in its
remaining weeks of this session
is to institute a joint commit-
tee to sit during the recess and
set up new means of control
following the lines suggested
by the Hoover Commission.
Before we can hope to save
ourselves from disaster by spe-
cific savings, we must re-estab-
lish the means for over-all budg-
et control. For the days of
unexpected surpluses are over.
