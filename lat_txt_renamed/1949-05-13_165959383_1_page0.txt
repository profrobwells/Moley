Kremlin Takes Another Look,
and Changes Economic Tune
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Something seems to be going
on in the official Soviet eco-
nomic brains trust. For three
years the economic soothsayers
over there have been awaiting
an American depression which,
according to Marx, must come
in our capitalistic economy at
regular and foreordained inter-
vals.
That fact has clearly been
shown in various interviews
with Stalin, notably the one
which was held with Harold
Stassen. Disappointment has so
far greeted these expectations.
Many circumstances, includ-
ing our huge rearmament and
foreign aid programs, have
needled us into an inflationary
boom. Can it be that the Soviet
economic high command now
recognizes that Russian per-
versity has actually been pro-
moting a boom and preventing
a depression, and that the best
way to injure us is to make
conciliatory moves which will
induce a reduction in our spend-
ing for military purposes?
*
This bit of speculation has
been surveyed in a number of
casual conversations among
economists of late. It is difficult
if not impossible to prove.
The best argument for such
speculation is the fact that Rus-
sian economists, whose minds
move in heavy, dogmatic cir-
cles, place implicit faith in the
power of government to control
the economic cycle. In that re-
spect they are like the left-wing
economists in this country who
for years have preached the
doctrine that a free economy
will always run itself into a
cycle of boom and bust and that
only regulated government
spending can level off the hills
and valleys.
*
There is no doubt that Rus-
sian economists have been very
active of late reconsidering
their earlier pronouncements
and evaluating the effect of
world economic developments
on Soviet policy. We now, learn
that the Soviet Institute of Eco-
nomics is at work on a new
and, of course, official textbook
on economics. This will replace
a text prepared in 1930 which
has been gospel in Russian
schools.
Recently, also, we have heard
of the recantation by Eugen
Varga of views which caused
his removal two years ago from
the office of chief of the Insti-
tute of World Economics and
World Politics. Varga's book,
which caused his fall, appeared
in 1946. It pointed out various
new circumstances and condi-
tions which had resulted from
the World War and which would
delay or prevent an economic
collapse in Western Europe for
10 years. This ran sharply
counter to the official Soviet
view.
Varga has now, perhaps un-
der great pressure, revised the
opinions in this book. Perhaps
also he has been hearing about
signs of a slight economic de-
cline in the United States.

Since the views of the Soviet
economic high command are
closely related to Politburo pol-
icies, it is possible that political
moves in the direction of con-
ciliation may be intended to
promote economic decline in
Western Europe and in the
United States.
We shall no doubt soon hear
a lot of Soviet propaganda to
the effect that the North At-
lantic pact is proof of the "im-
perialistic trend in modern cap-
italism."
In any event, the success of
our strategy in the cold war, the
prospect of victory in Berlin
and the encouraging revival of
Western Europe have proved
the futility of Soviet policies
since the end of the war. Pres-
sure from the Iron Curtain has
been met by overwhelming
countermeasures. As realists
the rulers of the Kremlin may
well be expected to try other
tactics.
If those tactics should be
moved toward conciliation, we
should be ever more alert to see
that a depression over here
should not come, and the way
to prevent that is to keep up
all reasonable efforts toward
security while making savings
in matters which are not related
to military expenditures; by
squaring government policies
with the needs of a free
economy.
