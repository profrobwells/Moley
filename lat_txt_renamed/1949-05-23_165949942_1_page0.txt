Two of Hoover Proposals
Seem Likely to Be Adopted
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The chance seems to be
bright in Congress to enact two
of the Hoover Commission's
proposals for increasing effi-
ciency and reducing the cost of
the Federal government.
One of these-a plan to im-
prove the State Department or-
ganization--has passed the Sen-
ate and is now before the
House. This plan will not save
money, but it will improve ef-
ficiency.
Another proposal, which will
save a good deal, has received
unanimous committee approval
in the Senate and will probably
pass. This bill sets up a "house-
keeping" agency under the
President. It would take over
government purchasing of sup-
plies, the management of rec-
ords and the operation and
management of public build-
ings.
There is no party conflict in
these bills. The President him-
self seems heartily in favor of
both.

It hardly needs to be pointed
out that the Federal govern-
ment is perhaps the biggest
customer for all manner of
goods in the country. It is also
the most immense renter of
space. Supplies for the civil
agencies, together with their
transportation and storage, cost
more than $1,000,000,000 a year.
The armed services pay $5,000,-
000,000 more. Rents, telephones,
light, etc., cost $200,000,000.
Accumulated supplies in gov-
ernment warehouses have cost
$27,000,000,000. And it may be
added that the Hoover Commis-
sion points out that all this
stuff should have been bought
more economically, and much
should never have been bought
at all.
The government makes 3,000,-
000 separate purchases a year,
and half of them average less
than $10 each. The actual cost
of buying an article, aside from
the amount paid for it, is more
than $10. Hence, under the pres-
ent system every article worth
$10 actually costs the taxpayer
twice that amount.
Government is big business
operating on principles and
with methods appropriate to an
inefficient general store. The
bill designed to correct these
deficiencies follows the Hoover
recommendations. It would set
up an Office of General Services
under an administrator. Under
him would be a director for
each of four activities. It is
claimed that this co-ordination
would save $250,000,000 a year.
