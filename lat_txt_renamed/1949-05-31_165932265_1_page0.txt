Perhaps the Germans will
say, "Half a Reich is better than
none," pending the outcome of
the meeting of Foreign Min-
isters in Paris.
For the new German state,
with the constitution created at
Bonn, is an odd successor to
four former Reichs. Germans
reckon their history as divided
into four Reichs. The first was
created by Charlemagne and
dissolved by Bismarck. The
second was created by Bismarck
and proclaimed at Versailles in
1871. The third, under the re-
publican Weimar constitution,
followed World War I. The
fourth was Hitler's, which he
claimed would last 1000 years.
Now we have the beginnings of
a fifth.
The new "half Reich" does
not formally constitute itself as
a successor to preceding states.
Its sovereignty, as far as other
nations are concerned, is in the
occupying power. It will have
a president but no real foreign
policy of its own.
Its population is large, de-
spite the amputation of the
Russian-occupied eastern zone.
The Hitler Reich before the an-
nexation of Austria had a popu-
lation of 70,000,000. The present
half Reich must have a popula-
tion of about 55,000,000. About
15% of these people have moved
in, during or since the war,
from Eastern Germany, Poland
and Czechosolvakia.
The domestic situation, as far
as public and private property
rights are concerned, is chaotic.
The old state of Prussia has dis-
appeared and its territory is
divided among several old and
new states. The public build-
ings, the railways, telegraph
system, telephones and the great
arterial highways are vested in
the new Reich. The public em-
ployees of the old Reich are
taken over by the new state.
Confusion prevails in private
property rights, especially in
pensions, which are sacred ob-
ligations in the German mind.
In states and cities there has
been some resumption of pen-
sion payments. But in the new
national state there seems to
be no provision for honoring
such obligations.
The new state has not desig-
nated a capital. The Parliament
will meet temporarily at Bonn,
but the administration is at
Frankfurt, 200 miles away. It
seems to be recognized that
when things settle down the
capital will be moved to West-
ern Berlin.
The new Reich has one great
asset. It has the best of German
industry and a population willing
to work. The Paris meet-
ings may release this potential,
and if so, the future of Germany,
even a half Germany, may be
bright.
