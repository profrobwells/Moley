Why Can't Taxing Agencies
Divide the Spoils Equitably?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
One of the greatest sources
of the waste of government
funds, as well as the greatest
of all threats to local self-gov-
ernment, is the present system
of Federal grants-in-aid to
States. The crowded pie count-
er of proposals now before Con-
gress has a large number of
such items-grants for educa-
tion, for health facilities, hous-
ing and the like.
These proposals in large part
are false fronts to cover up the
lack of any real solution of the
question of what a State should
do and what the Federal gov-
ernment should do. Often the
proposals are justified by the
doubtful claim that poor States
have to live at the expense of
rich States. But even in such
cases, where a State is undoubt-
edly too poor to meet its obli-
gations, there is a large measure
of deception. States are not al-
ways as poor as they claim to
be. Their rags and tatters often
cover real means of self-sup-
port.

But as long as Uncle Sam has
no means of checking these
claims or is drunk with power
and money, he will open his
purse to all and sundry suppli-
cants.
Too often the question is not
real poverty, but silly tax laws
that prevent the States and
cities from getting tax money to
which they are legitimately en-
titled.
Grants-in-aid from States to
cities and other local units of
government are also serious
sources of injustice and waste.
Since 1910, grants-in-aid from
States to local governments hav-
risen from $75,000,000 to $3,000,-
000,000 and Federal grants-in-
aid to States have risen from
$5,000,000 to $2,000,000,000.
Meanwhile, States, localities
and the Federal government
have been scrambling about,
looking for new things to tax.
More and more things are being
taxed more than once, while
good tax sources are being over-
looked or are legally out of
bounds.
In States which have income
taxes, that source bears a dou-
Die load, while in other States
the burden is shifted. Both the
States and the Federal govern-
ment grab something from the
property left by the dead. All
sorts of complications arise
from various luxury and ex-
cise taxes. Storekeepers are
driven to distraction by calcu-
lations on the price of goods.

What is needed is a separa-
tion of tax sources and the as-
signment of exclusive access to
each by Federal, State or local
government. For example, the
Federal government might give
up estate and gift taxes, leav-
ing these sources to the States,
while the States might give up
income taxes. This exchange
would be a fairly even trade,
somewhere between $800,000,000
and $900,000,000. Other even
exchanges could be worked out.
Beyond that, the Federal gov-
ernment might remove taxes on
enough sources to permit the
States to collect more revenue
and thus eliminate the need for
Federal grants-in-aid.
