Prophets Were Either Wrong
or Right for Wrong Reasons
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last November, after the
election, all and sundry politi-
cal prophets, pollsters and
soothsayers were silenced by
the greatest horse laugh in the
nation's history.
Economic forecasters have
been almost equally unlucky
since the war, but because their
mistakes have been scattered
over a longer time, they have
escaped the harshness of the
judgments that fell upon their
political brethren. Moreover,
In many instances they have
been right in spite of them-
selves, for reasons that they
never expected. They have had
a windfall of luck.
As early as 1943 some eco-
nomic prophets predicted a
frightening postwar inflation.
They based this on the assump-
tion that immediately after the
war people would make a rush
to cash their bonds and, with
markets empty of consumer
goods, thus precipitate a huge
price rise. The price rise took
place, but not because the peo-
ple cashed their bonds. To date,
the American people have
bought more bonds than they
have sold. The inflation came
for reasons other than the one
predicted.
Then there were some, in
1944, who predicted that a year
or two after the war our econ-
omy would catch up with re-
plenishment and that large un-
employment and sinking prices
would result. Here the predic-
tion itself was wrong.
A recent pamphlet by one of
those who have been wrong
blames it all on the late John
Maynard Keynes. This pam-
phlet says that those who saw
an early business decline must
have been disciples of Keynes.
All those who were wrong
as to the facts or right for the
wrong reasons now recognize
that something they did not an-
ticipate entered the picture.
Shortly after the war and even
before the GIs came home, the
nation began rearming. Then
came the cold war, starting
with Greece and Turkey.
Our expenditures for national
defense and for gifts abroad
rose to approximately $25,000,
000,000 a year. This is more
than any war in the past ever
claimed for such a long period.
Translated into labor costs it
means that at least 8,000,000
persons must have been work-
ing through those years for
armament and foreign aid. This
prohibited unemployment, cre-
ated overemployment, brought
about shortages and raised
prices and wages.
The present decline must
mean that our economy has be-
come so productive that we can
support a cold war with great
armament expenditures and
aid for Europe, meet demands
for replenishment, supply nor-
mal demand, and still have a
slowly falling rate of employ-
ment.
