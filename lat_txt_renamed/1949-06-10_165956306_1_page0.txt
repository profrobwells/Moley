How A. P. Giannini Won Out
'in '33 Crisis Told by Insider
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Practically nothing has been
written, in the accounts of the
massive and tempestuous ca-
reer of the late A. P. Giannini,
about a few hours in 1933
when the fate of his great bank
was literally held in the hands
of one man, Treasury Secretary
Will Woodin. The lack of writ-
ten history on this tremendous
crisis is probably owing to the
facts that so few people were
witnesses to the decision and
that two of the key figures,
Woodin and his predecessor,
Ogden Mills, are dead.
*
The great Bank of America
was, of course, closed with all
other banks in the memorable
holiday which began on Mon-
day, March 6. During the week
that followed, feverish activity
went on in the Treasury to de-
termine which banks were suf-
ficiently solvent to open on the
following Monday.
Congress passed the Emer-
gency Banking Act on Thurs-
day, which cleared the way to
the method by which needful
but solvent banks were able to
get help from the RFC to pro-
tect them when they opened.
In the main, the decisions were
made by Woodin, acting on the
advice and information provid-
ed by the acting Comptroller of
the Currency. Woodin, if con-
vinced that a bank could safely
open, passed the word to Jesse
Jones, who provided RFC aid.
Giannini had made many
powerful enemies during his
tremendous rise in banking,
and some of them were ready
in this emergency to strike him
down. All sorts of advice
came in to the Treasury as to
the solvency of the Bank of
America.
*
The decision was made at a
conference at which there were
present Woodin, holdover Un-
dersecretary Arthur Ballantine,
Acting Comptroller of the Cur-
rency F. G. Awalt, and two or
three others whose names I do
not immediately recall. I was
there as a sort of general assist-
ant to Woodin in that period of
his administration.
The case was discussed from
all angles. The solvency of a
bank was very difficult to de-
termine, because values of all
sorts were in the balance, de-
pending upon the extent to
which confidence could be re-
stored in the banks.
*
I well remember that the
consideration which finally pre-
valled was the immense impor-
tance of Giannini's bank in the
whole social structure of Cali-
fornia. Untold chaos would re-
sult from its fall.
There were also considered
the character and mental re-
sourcefulness of Giannini him-
self. He had weathered many a
storm. We felt that he could
weather this one. And the sol-
vency of his bank seemed to
be borne out by the figures.
Woodin, whose tiny, frail
body belled his shrewd intelli-
gence and indomitable will, de-
cided to open the bank. Over
the telephone he brushed aside
the protests of certain orthodox
captains of finance and gave
the order. He turned to me and
said, "Tell 'em it's going to
open."
*
He referred to the two Cali-
fornia Senators, Hiram Johnson
and W. G. McAdoo, who were
waiting in an anteroom. I
never delivered a message that
gave me more pleasure and,
believe me, the two Senators
never heard better news.
Subsequently, the judgment
of Woodin was to be justified a
hundredfold. The bank grew
and grew, until it is now the
largest in the world. And it is
but the lengthened shadow and
monument of the man who
made it. "A. P." was one of the
great makers of America. We
shall wait a long time to see his
equal.
