Truman Planning to Play
Farm Plan for All It's Worth
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a happy, confident mood,
President Truman is willing to
bet a dollar that his Brannan
farm plan will be adopted at
this session of the 81st Con-
gress-or that most of it will be
enacted this year and the re-
mainder next year.
He has reason to be happy,
because it is hard to see how
he can lose politically. The mere
fact that the plan may be a dé-
lusion or that it may not be en-
acted is not important to him or
to Secretary Brannan. The
political fact is that he has a
plan which can be beautifully
dressed up for farm consump-
tion and, if Congress defeats
it, he can in 1950 blame the
Republicans. This strategy is
going to be especially useful if
1950 is to be a year of high un-
employment, low prices and
slow business.
If the new plan is not adopt-
ed, there is still plenty of au-
thority under the Republican
Aiken-Hope Act of 1948 to keep
the farmers fairly comfortable.
And they can be reminded by
Democratic speakers of how
much happier they would be
under the Brannan plan.
Meanwhile, Republicans are
reduced to a negative course.
They can attack the Brannan
plan and they can defend their
own Aiken-Hope Act. But they
have no new plan of their own.
That is to say their party has
no plan on which all the re-
sponsible members are united.
It must be conceded, too, that
the Truman administration is
playing very shrewd politics in
attempting to cut into Repub-
lican strongholds in the Mid-
west. Until Truman's election,
this had not been done by Dem-
ocrats since Roosevelt made
great inroads there in 1932.
In the second and third
Roosevelt terms, the Democrat-
ic Party steadily lost ground in
farm regions. It concentrated
on labor and the cities, Wallace
seemed to lose interest in the
farm vote and turned more and
more to labor and kindred al-
lies.
Truman has reversed this
trend, and in Brannan he has
a most plausible salesman. This
was abundantly shown in the
recent Des Moines meeting. It
was the beginning of a system-
atic drive for a larger share in
the farm vote in regions where
Republicans cannot afford to
lose ground.
Truman won his election by
this strategy and he now pro-
poses to extend his gains. He
was, of course, helped by the
lack of opposition by his op-
ponent.
In the new drive much will
be made of the famous issue of
the storage bins. There is vio-
lent dispute about the responsi-
bility for the failure to provide
storage facilities for the bumper
grain crop of 1948. Brannan
claims that the Commodity
Credit Corp. was denied the
power to provide the bins last
year.
Sen. Wherry, Republican lead-
er, asserts that the CCC, under
law approved a year ago, had
that authority. In any event,
Brannan now has the authority
to provide storage bins, and
they will be ostentatiously dis-
tributed to farmers who have
surpluses.
The Brannan plan, moreover,
has a powerful class appeal. It
is designed for the "family size
farm." Big farms will not be
denied some support, but they
will get only as much as the
small farms. In voting on
quotas under the present law
next month, farms—small and
large—will be on an equal basis.
They will have one vote, re-
gardless of size.
The cost of the Brannan pro-
posal is unknown. Truman and
Brannan artfully avoid that is-
sue. Brannan only says that his
plan "does not cost anything
until farm prices have already
dropped down out of line as
compared with nonfarm prices."
Sen. Wherry, meanwhile, on
his own responsibility has pro-
posed that crop surpluses be
absorbed by a wide program of
turning grain into alcohol. This
idea, if adopted by Republicans
generally, might become a work-
able alternative. But there still
appears no disposition among
Republicans to accept it.
