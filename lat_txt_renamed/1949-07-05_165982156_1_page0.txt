Bureaucrats Follow Subsidies
As Little Lamb Tailed Mary
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The controversy among high
churchmen, educators and
statesmen over the pending
Federal grant of $300,000,000 to
the States for education seems
to by-pass the real issue of
principle. That issue is whether
any grant of Federal money,
for anything, should be made
without Federal supervision and
whether it is tolerable to have
any Federal supervision of our
common schools.
Cardinal Spellman and Bishop
Oxnam argue about whether
some of the money should go
to church schools. Gen. Eisen-
hower says money ought to
go only to States that genuinely
need the money. Herbert
Hoover, no doubt facing the
practical fact that the measure
may pass, attempts to get Congress
to limit its application
and to provide safeguards.
The question that should be
faced is whether this new Federal
invasion of the States
should be permitted at all.
There are other ways of helping
and compelling States,
where low standards exist, to
improve their schools.
The bill now before Congress
specifies 19 such States. Hoover
believes, with excellent reasons,
that only 12 are really too poor
to educate their children. These
States no doubt already receive
grants-in-aid for several other
purposes. They are, of course,
spending money for other
things, such as roads, aid to
agriculture, etc. It might be
possible, and it would seem
practical to grant them more
Federal money for these needs
on the condition that they shift
more of their own money to
their schools.
Another alternative might be
to grant the States that really
lack money for teachers, books
and supervision funds exclusively
for material things such
as buildings. There could be
no great injury to freedom in
education in Federal specifications
regarding the cost per
cubic foot of construction, fire
protection, toilet facilities and
the like. With some of the cost
of new buildings lifted, States
and local communities might
use more money for teachers,
books and supervision.
It is obvious from an examination
of present grants-in-aid
for all purposes and from the
provisions of this bill in particular
that the Federal government,
including Congress, has no real
scientific and automatic yardstick
to determine the economic
needs of a State. Such a matter
could conceivably be reduced
to a workable formula.
Among the factors to be considered
should be the taxable
resources of the State; the tax
burden on these resources; the
level of private income in the
State; agricultural and industrial
production; money flowing
into the State from outside dividends,
travelers' and tourists'
expenditures and the like;
usable natural resources and
many other items that comprise
State wealth. Also to be considered
is the relationship of the
number of children to State
wealth.
Certainly, no State should get
Federal aid merely because it
is able to advertise the wretchedness
of its provisions for educating
its children. Nor should
it establish its case by refusing
to tax its people properly or by
neglecting its schools while it
builds more highways, bridges
and football stadiums.
The present bill has some
brave words renouncing any intent
to tell States what they
should teach. But does anyone
suppose that this self-denying
ordinance will hold good in the
future? Or can anyone believe
that such a prohibition can be
imposed upon bureaucratic
busybodies? Experience shows
that wherever a Federal dollar
goes, a Federal bureaucrat will
be close behind. Like Mary's
lamb, he will soon appear in
school.
