British Press Is Acquitted
of Monopoly Accusation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two years ago, a group of
Labor Members of Parliament
who had been journalists by
trade raised a hullabaloo about
the monopolistic, biased and in-
accurate press of England. No
doubt, they were indulging in
a feeling that many newspaper-
men in all nations sometimes
entertain-a desire to pillory
their bosses before an approv-
ing nation.
This group of hostile MPs
then learned that, despite la-
bor supremacy, the traditions
of England have a way of deal-
ing with such accusations-an
orderly, fair and impartial way.
A royal commission was ap-
pointed to investigate the charg-
es and to report. The report
has now been made.
The charges have rebounded
in the faces of the accusers.
It might be well if the Amer-
ican press would overcome its
reticent modesty and give this
report a full treatment in its
own columns. For the same
kind of charges have been re-
peatedly made against Amer-
ican newspapers, not only by
irresponsible radicals but by
high government authorities.
The late President Roosevelt,
sincerely or not, held the no-
tion that newspaper owners
dictated, with a precision that
would be fantastically impos-
sible in practice, every fact
and opinion published in their
papers.
I remember on one occasion
that Harry Hopkins poured out
a story to the eager ears of his
boss that every morning after
the President made a speech the
Morgan partners held a meeting
and, after deciding on a reply,
would telephone their orders
to the editorial writers of the
big New York papers. The
facts, which I verified for my
amusement at the time, were
that the Morgan partners held
meetings at 11 o'clock; that
many of them had not had time
to read the President's speech;
that they had financial head-
aches to treat; that they had
enough to do without trying to
write editorials; that the toilers
in the editorial offices had dead-
lines to meet and had to figure
out their own opinions; and,
finally, that in any decent news-
paper office anyone making such
a suggestion, even a Morgan
partner, would have been told
about the nether regions as a
place to move for permanent
residence. But Roosevelt hap-
pily entertained such fantasies
and often made public his
accusations of bias, monopoly
and external pressure. Presi-
dent Truman, more mildly and
in better humor, has made com-
plaints of the same nature.
The British commission re-
ports that "nothing approaching
a monopoly" exists and that in
the past 25 years there has been
a strong trend away from con-
centration in national news-
papers. The appearance of
monopoly comes from mass
circulation.
The report concludes that the
press itself should provide
means for self-regulation. That,
it would seem, is the best rem-
edy for faults which are not
denied on either side of the
Atlantic.
