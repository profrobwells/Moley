Totalitarian's Dream Looms
Over Four Northwest States
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman soundly
defeated Gov. Dewey in the
State of Washington last year
and carried with him all the
State offices except the Governorship.
Arthur Langlie won
that by a decisive majority
over Mon C. Wallgren.
★
Langlie's victory, however,
imposed upon him the tremendous
responsibility of heading
the fight against the effort of
the Truman administration and
the assorted Democrats and
left-wingers in the State of
Washington to put over a Columbia
Valley Administration
plan. This plan would establish
over a great area, running into
four States, an authority which
would be the nearest thing to
Socialism ever hatched in the
United States.
The CVA plan as proposed
by the Truman administration
would unite Federal projects
for the development of water
power, irrigation, flood control,
conservation of land resources,
forestry, minerals, transportation,
fish, wild life, and recreation
in a vast area covering
practically all the State of
Washington and stretching
into neighboring States. The
area would be seven times that
controlled by the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
The governing body would
be a board of three, appointed
by the President for a term
of six years. The project would
gather under its concentrated
authority practically all the
Federal activities in that field.
It would also supplant a large
part of State authority. It
would substantially be above
all State power of regulation
and control. It would have
what amounts to taxing power
in local communities. Moreover,
its control of its own finances
would by-pass the
appropriation power of Congress
and the budgetary control
of the President.
★
It would in effect be a great
regional government over States
and local units and, through delegation,
it would operate virtually
independently of Federal
authority.
Beyond all this, it is easy to
see the building of a political
dictatorship unparalleled in
America. For the agencies of
coercion and propaganda of the
CVA would penetrate to every
community. It would be a totalitarian's
dream.
