One of the 'Sleepers' Exposed
in the Columbia Valley Bill
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Tucked away in the Senate
bill that proposes to set up a
totalitarian Columbia Valley
Administration is a section that
may well be the handiwork of
David Lilienthal or one of his
own special bent of mind. He
was, of course, the boss of the
TVA, which provided the in-
spiration for his vastly more
authoritarian scheme for the
Northwest.
The provision says, "the doc-
trine of beneficial consump-
tive use of water shall be rec-
ognized, and in the event of
any conflict between the pur-
poses for which the waters of
the region may be used, pref-
erence shall be given to atomic
energy requirements for na-
tional defense and to domestic
requirements for national de-
fense and to domestic irrigation,
mining and industrial pur-
poses."
*
Why the latter purposes
should be repeated in this way
is not clear, since they are the
original and professed pur-
poses of the whole scheme. Per-
haps a clever bill writer put
them in to indicate an order
of priority which a friendly
supreme court can use if the
occasion requires it. Perhaps it
is to take the edge off the im-
plication that the real purpose
is to shroud in the mysteries of
the atomic energy project any
suggestion that the rulers of
the CVA shall not have para-
mount power.
It shows, however, how the
architects of the welfare state
use more than one justification
for their purposes of control.
If the vague term "general
welfare" fails, they fall back
upon national defense, and final-
ly upon the misty atmosphere of
atomic energy.
All this may suggest that
the impact of atomic energy
may fall not upon the cities
and armies of Russia, but up-
on the remains of freedom in
the United States. For if the
Russian threat can be kept
alive, our activities in develop-
ing atomic energy can be so
controlled as to provide a per-
fect bureaucratic means of reg-
imenting our life when that
source of power is ready to use
for domestic and civilian pur-
poses.
It is clear that when atomic
energy has been developed for
nonmilitary uses it may well
rank with or supplant power
from water and coal. We have
already seen how utterly mon-
opolistic power over coal,
through John L. Lewis, can
make Presidents and Congresses
dance to its tunes. The govern-
ment's projects in water power,
especially this plan for a CVA,
can regiment vast sections of
the country. Control of atomic
energy can do it better and
with more bureaucratic secrecy.
Utimately, therefore, atomic
energy will be, if present pur-
poses are carried out, the means
for an over-all regimentation
not only of our business life
but of all life. We all will be
the first conquests of the atom.
