Two West Coast Problems:
Too Much Water; Too Little
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As a traveler moves out from
Washington and Oregon to
Southern California, he finds
that water is the major concern
in both regions. But with a
major difference.
The Northwest is concerned
about what to do with water.
In the great inland and coastal
area of Southern California, the
concern is what to do for water.
It is too early to suggest the
presence of a crisis, but it takes
very little looking ahead to see
that the flood of human immi-
gration will overwhelm the
available supply of water.
The problem, as the wise and
experienced Gov. Warren puts
it, is not a single-sided one. It
breaks up into many local short-
ages, each with its special rela-
tionship to one of many varying
sources of supply.
To take a special case, the
city of Santa Barbara and ad-
joining coastal areas have been
dependent for years upon a
storage dam in the nearby
mountains, with a supplemen-
tary supply from big artesian
wells. Two dry winters have
depleted the supply behind the
dam, and there is danger that
the water in the wells will sink
to a level where salt will de-
stroy its usefulness. Meanwhile,
unprecedented numbers of peo-
ple have been moving in since
the war. A new dam is pro-
jected, but the opposition of a
rancher or two in the valley
has temporarily prevented fa-
vorable action in Congress.
The situation in the inland
valleys is generally made seri-
ous because the multiplication
of wells has lowered the sup-
ply, and the inevitable salt is
appearing.
The Los Angeles region seems
less disturbed. Years ago, there
was sufficient vision to build
the great Owens Valley project,
and when Hoover Dam was
built a new supply was ac-
quired. But in a city which is
pressing into second place in
the nation, there is need for
more Colorado River water.
To tap that supply further
or even to get whatever con-
tractual obligations seem to
have been guaranteed, a fight
is developing with the State of
Arizona. That once arid State
wants more water for a big
agricultural development of its
own. The dispute seems, so far,
to baffle all efforts at compro-
mise. It may end in the Su-
preme Court.

Nature has provided along
the coast of California a place
of singular attractiveness. But
nature has not provided, be-
tween the San Francisco Bay
and the border of Mexico, a
single river which flows with-
out interruption for 12 months
of the year. And despite heroic
engineering feats, the popula-
tion rises while the water level
falls. You hear a lot out here
about the maldistribution of
wealth. But the real issue is the
maldistribution of moisture.
