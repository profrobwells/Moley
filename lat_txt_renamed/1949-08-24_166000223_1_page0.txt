Urgent Job
Is Found for
Sen. Hoey
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Some of us are old enough to
remember when everybody was
away from Washington in Au-
gust and national news came
from the Black Hills or Buz-
zard's Bay. But air condition-
ing has done a lot for our na-
tional life, and now it looks as if
deep freezing has provided fresh
and edible Washington news in
August. Apparently, the White
House is surrounded by men of
real imagination, not to say a
meaty sense of humor.
Washington is full of the
wrong kind of know-how. Or
should we say "know-whom"?

Bernard Baruch once said it
would be almost impossible to
prevent graft when the govern-
ment began to sell off its great
accumulation of surplus ma-
terials and plants. He said that
such transactions would have
to be handled "In a goldfish
bowl."
It looks now as if some of
them have been handled in ice
bowls.
It has always been puzzling
that the government has been
getting prices for its plants far
below what they cost during the
war. The President, as well as
every builder, tells us how much
the cost of construction has gone
up since the war. No one knows
how much the giveaway has
amounted to. The figures have
not been fully and clearly pub-
lished. But the time has come
for an accounting, and it begins
to look as if we would get it.

One of the ironies in the situ-
ation is that the man whose job
it is to see to a full disclosure is
Sen. Clyde Hoey of North Caro-
lina, who occupies almost the
same spot in which Sen. Tru-
man gained the renown that
made him the nominee for the
Vice-Presidency. Truman was
Chairman of the special commit-
tee to investigate the national
defense program. Hoey is Chair-
man of the investigation sub-
committee of the Senate Com-
mittee on Expenditures in the
Executive Departments. It is up
to Hoey now.
President Truman is taking all
this with an emotional flair that
is a credit to his loyalty rather
than to his sense of judicial val-
ues. Apparently he feels that he
is called upon to defend Gen.
Vaughan in all circumstances.
In his press conference last
week he was apparently rattled.
The conference must have been
somewhat heated.
*
But the President did not
seem very clear in his recollec-
tion of the details of the testi-
mony of Tighe Woods, the Hous-
ing Expediter, regarding
Vaughan's part in getting a per-
mit for scarce building material
for the Tanforan race track.
After Truman said he did not
know it was a fact, and neither
did the reporter, that Vaughan
had succeeded in getting this
permit, he was reminded of
Woods' testimony. Truman then
said with emphasis that he had
no comment to make on the
matter.
The whole Vaughan situation
highlights a condition which has
existed around the White House
for generations, particularly
during the Roosevelt regime.
Everyone is beset by pleasant,
resourceful and well-heeled peo-
ple who have an ax to grind.
White House attaches should
remind themselves that their
status in life is ceremonial, not
executive. That lesson seems to
be one that needs reaffirmation.
