Spenders Hail
the Deficit
as a Boon
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the memoirs of the late
Charles Michelson, he confessed
that he never knew "beans"
about economics. Despite this
deficiency, Michelson directed
publicity for the Democratic Na-
tional Committee throughout
the 30s and early 40s. He issued
official statements, wrote
speeches for Democratic Sena-
tors and high administration
officials. His ghostly voice spoke
for a national party.
In dealing with economic is-
sues, he followed a simple pat-
tern. If economic trends moved
in one direction, he found fine
results. If trends turned, he
found different but better ef-
fects. And always he gave the
ruling administration credit for
the fruits. When his ingenuity
flagged, he fell back on the old
stand-byâ€”things were worse
under Hoover.

That political technique is
now being used by politicians
in explaining the growing
budget deficit. When windfall
surpluses were appearing dur-
ing the first postwar years in
amounts far beyond the Presi-
dent's January estimates, there
was pointing with pride.
Now that increasing deficits
are in order, administration
economists of the Keyserling-
Hansen school of spending are
finding great benefits in red ink.
A flood of propaganda will now
appear similar to the Keynes-
inspired theory of the 30s. For
unless a good political excuse
can be found for an unbalanced
budget, there will be an over-
whelming demand for reduced
spending. That would be dis-
astrous for an administration
which hopes to keep power by
lavish benefits on all sides.
It is time, therefore, to cut
through the theoretical argu-
ments for deficit financing and
see the truth. For there is im-
mense danger in an unbalanced
budget, especially at a time like
this, when national income and
production are at very high
levels.
Not the least of the dangers
is the situation in which we
would find ourselves in case
of war or further international
complications.
The printing of new bonds
and their sale to individuals and
banks narrows the market for
business credits.
Deficit spending through
loans exceeding a small amount
is only slightly deferred infla-
tion which is certain to break
out at a most undesirable time.
Monetary inflation induced by
increasing the government debt
cannot be turned on and off at
the will of any government. For
it involves a large and inde-
terminate public psychology.
Money flies from one form of
investment to another, as those
who hold it seek safety. In
continued inflation a stage of
panic is reached which is dis-
astrous to all.

In the ensuing confusion,
private savings are eaten away
and greater demands are made
for government grants and bene-
fits.
These are some of the results
of the vicious spiral of spend-
ing, borrowing and inflation. No
government can prevent them.
But a government can contrib-
ute to the cause.
