Measurement of Hot Air
in Senate Upsets Tradition
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On Aug. 29, the Senate, while
more important matters await-
ed consideration, heard a bitter
argument on the question
whether Republicans or Demo-
crats had talked the most dur-
ing this session.
This discussion arose because
Sen. Ferguson on Aug. 24 stat-
ed on the floor that, according
to figures compiled by the Li-
brary of Congress, Democratic
talk printed in the Congression-
al Record had filled 1612 pages;
and Republican talk, 1563 pages.
Sen. Wherry later cited these
figures in a radio talk.

Sen. Lucas challenged them.
He said that after the Ferguson
speech he asked the Library of
Congress for the figures and
that he received a letter, which
he placed in the Record, from
the legislative reference serv-
ice of the library. This stated
that Democrats used in this
session, from Jan. 3 to Aug. 15,
2134 columns or 811 pages; the
Republicans, 2779 columns, or
926 pages.
Later that day, Sen. Wherry
inserted in the Record a com-
plete compilation of the space
in the Record occupied by the
talk of each Senator on every
day of the session. He claimed
that this compilation had been
made by the Senate library.
The apparent disparity between
the compilations was not ex-
plained.
It does not seem to be im-
portant whether Democrats or
Republicans talk most. A page
used by a Taft or a Byrd is usu-
ally more important than a doz-
en by some other Senators. The
real issue is quality, not quanti-
ty. And a few long-winded gen-
tlemen on either side can swing
the balance. No party can be
charged with a monopoly of
windjammers.
The real interest in the Wher-
ry compilation, which is open
to all citizens, is the vast dis-
parity among Senators in their
capacity to talk away precious
hours of a session. In a cur-
sory examination of these fig-
ures, a large amount of vener-
able mythology falls to the
ground. There seems to be no
section in the country from
which Senatorial talkers pre-
dominate. Fred Allen's Sen.
Claghorn was an injustice to
the South. Some of the most
tight-lipped gentlemen come
from that region. New Eng-
land was not especially brief
in its remarks.

Nor is any conclusion pos-
sible as to the prevalence of
talkers in either party. Pep-
per of Florida vied with Morse
of Oregon for voluminous space.
Graham, North Carolina Dem-
ocrat, considering the fact that
he was once a college president,
was amazingly quiet; but when
he broke loose he used eight
pages.
But the women of America,
eternally cited for talk, can be
proud of Mrs. Margaret Chase
Smith, Maine Republican. She
was silent until March 17, when
she spoke a page. Perhaps that
was a celebration of St. Patrick.
Then she was quiet for two
months. She spoke three times
in May and once in June and
once in August. On each of
these occasions she used one-
ninth of a page. That is rough-
ly about five minutes of talk.
Before we rush to conclu-
sions, however, let us keep one
consideration in mind. Maybe
she is waiting for the last word.
