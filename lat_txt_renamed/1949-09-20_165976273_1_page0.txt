Mr. Truman,
as Seen in His
Appointments
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are two kinds of politi-
cal appointments. First, there
are appointments for the sake
of a party; second, appoint-
ments for the pleasure, satis-
faction and political advantage
of the politician making the
appointment. The Minton ap-
pointment to the Supreme
Court falls into the second
category.
There was no strong party
reason for appointing the erst-
while Senator from Indiana.
The Democratic situation there
has changed greatly since the
great days of the McNutt-Mc-
Hale-Elder machine, of which
Minton was a wheel horse.
The President seems to have
made this selection on personal
grounds.
The succession of appoint-
ments to the Supreme Court
furnishes an excellent key to
the evaluation of Truman, the
President.
First, there was the strictly
nonpartisan appointment of
Burton, a Republican, and a
mild conservative.
Then there was the selec-
tion of Vinson, a worthy party
man.
Then Clark, hardly quali-
fied as a judge, but close to
the President and always
amenable to his wishes.
Now Minton, a purely per-
sonal choice with less party
justification than in the case of
Clark. This means that Tru-
man is clearly falling victim
to the toxic atmosphere of per-
sonal victory and the power
of office.
The decline of the court, clear-
ly in evidence since the appoint-
ment of Black 12 years ago,
continues. Under Roosevelt, real
distinction on the bench in
lesser courts, established pro-
fessional capacity, long service
in private practice were brushed
aside, and ideological sympathy
was the test. But Truman has
no ideology; he knows only
political friends and political
expediency. In either case, the
result is the sameâ€”a loss of
prestige for what was once the
most inviolate of our institu-
tions.
