Workers Will Have to Learn
There's No Cut-Rate Security
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The crisis in coal and steel
highlights the delusions that
ambitious labor leaders have
created concerning pensions and
welfare funds. They have in-
duced their dues-paying mem-
bers to believe that the schemes
they are proposing and that
Jonn L. Lewis nas forced upon
the coal industry will purchase
real security. But, after Murray
and Lewis have been mingling
with their ancestors in the long
rest of death, those members
will learn the bitter truth.
*
In the case of the steel-
workers, the truth will come out
in figures, that the insurance
companies have learned after
long experience. Legitimate
actuarial figures have no kinship
with politics, collective
bargaining or the soothing
words through which a Mur-
ray keeps his job with his
union. The moving finger of
mathematics writes, and all the
piety and wit of a labor baron
cannot erase a line.
You don't bargain with an insurance
company. You take
what the figures show or take
your chances with fate. You
may shop around among companies.
There are innumerable
variations in life or annuity
policies which are useful in competition
for prospects. But when
you lay the figures side by side,
there isn't much difference.
This is because the high integrity
of the companies and duty to
stock or policy holders compel
the writing of risk with due regard
for scientific actuarial
figures.

The Murray demand for a
$100 pension for six cents an
hour is a "complete phony," as
one commentator has put it.
Truman's fact-finding board
was either hopelessly naive or
insincere in following the
union's argument that a $125
monthly pension would be provided
by something like 12Â½
cents an hour. That board, seeking
a compromise, cut the figure
to 6 cents and somehow came
up with a figure of $70 a month.
This, with the Social Security
grant, would presumably mean
$100 a month.
Apparently it was not deemed
politic by the union officers to
admit that there would be a
vast disparity between what
old and young workers would
ultimately receive as a pension.
It cannot even be stated as a
fact that the youngest worker
at this time could, after a lifetime,
earn a $70-a-month pension
for a 6-cent payment in lieu
of a wage increase. Certainly,
there would be no possibility of
men in the 50s getting that
much unless the benefits were
funded by an immense outright
capital contribution by the companies.
Murray must have known
this. But he also calculated that,
if his unworkable proposition
were accepted by the companies,
he would be able later
on to lay the effects of the plan
on them. He could say that if
they accepted his plan they
should later on accept the responsibility
of carrying it out.
This is the old game, so often
practiced in Congress, of getting
a principle accepted which
will provide the means of
eternal pressure for new funds.

The Lewis welfare fund was
a delusion from the first. It was
forced upon the operators with
little consideration of all the
factors involved. Almost immediately
it was shown to be
inadequate. In the first place, it
was dependent upon the demand
for or the production of
coal. It depended also upon the
renewal of a short-term contract,
and it depended upon a
free economy in which ownership
might change hands.
The fact is that such schemes
can never guarantee security in
a free society. And in a society
in which a totalitarian government
takes over, such guarantees
are even more lightly held.
Those elder Germans who
placed their faith in Bismarck's
pension plan learned that.
