Tito's Case Tears Away
the Communist Mask
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The roots of the struggle
which ended in the murder of
Leon Trotsky, some years ago,
lay in the basic denial of Marx-
ian internationalism by Stalin
and his government. The basic
issue in Tito's present battle
with Moscow is the same thing.
And no one who understands
the ruthless methods of the
Politburo expects this issue will
be resolved short of the same
expedient. The amazing thing
is that Tito has not been assas-
sinated before this. The reason
must be a system of personal
protection that has hardly been
seen before, except in the case
of Hitler.

But in a country where life is
cheap and assassination is a
refined art, it is hard to see how
Tito can long survive the fury
of his enemies.
There is no question about
that fury. The most recent
Soviet note has dropped the
pretense that Tito's heresy is
merely a failure to follow the
internationalism of the Comín-
form. The Soviet Union now
charges that Tito's government
—the government of the nation
—has become an enemy not of
international Communism but
of the Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, every conceivable
weapon of nationalistic force,
except war and assassination,
has been put into force. The
Soviets tried, first, to discredit
Tito in his own country by
denying its nationalistic claims
to a slice of Austria. Yugoslavs
in neighboring Balkan countries
have been organized under
Soviet direction to promote rev-
olution by remote control.
*
There are threats to move
these groups at some stated
time into Tito's country on a
mission of "liberation." Russia
is rattling the sword of armored
divisions at the border. And
every effort is being made to in-
cite subnationalistic move-
ments, such as that of Mace-
donia.
All this is not because Tito is
not a Communist. His type of
ideology, in fact, is much more
thoroughly Marxian than that
of Moscow. There are some dif-
ferences in method, notably in
his system of nationalizing
farms. But those are details.
Meanwhile, Tito is leaning
heavily upon the nationalistic
feeling of his own Yugoslavs
and has resisted and frustrated
every effort to upset his govern-
ment. He is even now prepar-
ing to carry the battle to his
opponents by organizing a Com-
inform of his own to win con-
verts in neighboring Balkan
countries and in Russia.
The simple fact is that this
battle with Tito has revealed
that the Politburo is not a real
instrument of international
Marxism, but a fiercely Russian
nationalistic government that
merely uses Communism as a
means for furthering its ends.
And Tito has shrewdly brought
this into the clear light of day.
The fury of Moscow has be-
trayed its realization of that
fact and more. It has shown
that its own position is not too
secure. A confident and stable
government never needs to
show violent emotion, even
when its Foreign Office is
headed by a creature of passion
like Vishinsky. Tito is merely
the incidental object of a mood
of frustration that arises from a
general failure.
*
That failure pertains to all of
the Soviet postwar plans for
domination in Europe. Its fail-
ure extends to its puppet gov-
ernments everywhere which are
feeling an increasing pressure
to resume relations with the
west.
Perhaps that frustration can-
not be eased, even by the mur-
der of Tito. But there is no
doubt that such a purpose is
high on the list of Soviet plans.
