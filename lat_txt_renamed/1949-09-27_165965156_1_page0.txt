Government Strikes Down
Whatever It Can't Control
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It does not seem logical that
a government which attacks
the A&P and the Du Pont Co.
because they are big and be-
cause they save consumers mon-
ey, coddles the co-operatives be-
cause they can by large opera-
tions save consumers money.
Yet, there is logic in these un-
related moves—a deadly and
threatening logic. The bigness
that this government tries to
destroy is private business
which rewards venture capital
with profits. The co-operatives,
as they grow in size to approach
private institutions and com-
panies, become quasigovern-
mental under the privileges and
tax coddling which government
provides.
Government strikes down
that which it cannot control. It
builds up what it can control.
The mind of the government of-
ficials moves irresistibly toward
more power for government.
That is logical. It is human
nature. And in facing the po-
litical scene the citizen may
well keep that ever in mind.

Since we are all ruled by
self-interest, it is well to keep
another aspect of this problem
in mind. Since for the time
being there are more private
citizens than there are gov-
ernment jobholders and people
whose jobs depend on the gov-
ernment, the private citizen
owes it to himself to act and
vote for his own interests.
He should try to get the most
for his money. He should hope
for more and bigger taxpayers
so that he himself will have
to pay less in taxes. He should
have the right of freedom of
choice—the right to shop around
for the best and cheapest prod-
ucts, to work where he finds
the most attractive conditions
and to compete against others
under rules that make ability to
serve the basic element of prog-
ress and survival.
At this point I realize that
many bureaucrats and Congress-
men will leap at what they
conceive to be a big hole in my
logic. They will say that small
shopkeepers and manufacturers
should be protected in their
businesses against giants like
the A&P and Du Pont. The
little fellow has the right to
have his business, too.
The answer to that falls into
the very pattern of democracy:
The greatest good to the great-
est number. Certainly, Presi-
dent Truman believes in that
principle. He has been con-
gratulating himself as a peo-
ple’s choice for 10 months.
There are more consumers than
there are storekeepers and man-
ufacturers. All the govern-
ment can insist upon is free
access to markets by all store-
keepers and manufacturers.
That access is already assured.

If the government is looking
for a real example of restraint
of competition, let it look to the
co-operatives. With their im-
mense privileges in matters of
taxation, they are in a position
ultimately to stamp out compe-
tition, regardless of efficiency.
Logic carries us a step fur-
ther. If government-minded
and power-hungry Congressmen
and bureaucrats pursue this
course to its end, the result
will be the extinction of private
business and the survival of gov-
ernment-operated or govern-
ment-“kept” businesses. When
that end is reached, a few peo-
ple—the bureaucrats and the
people interested in co-opera-
tives—will profit at the expense
of many people—the consumers.
In that final consummation
the small independent, now de-
luded by politicians, will also
pass away. For he cannot sur-
vive in a super state any more
than can a labor union. Finally,
the co-operatives go under and
government stands alone—in-
efficient, cumbersome, unimagi-
native, rapacious and all pow-
erful.
