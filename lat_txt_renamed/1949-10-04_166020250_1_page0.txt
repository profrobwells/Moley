Will National Income Rise
bv Inflation or Production?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman, in a speech
at a Kansas City meeting de-
signed to honor his chosen na-
tional chairman, William M.
Boyle Jr., Pendergastbred poli-
tician, once more proclaimed the
objectives of the welfare state.
With commendable frankness,
he accepted the new name for
his program, asserting that wel-
fare is a first objective in the
Constitution. The welfare state,
however, presents a very ex-
pensive prospect. It can be as-
sumed that, if it receives in-
dorsement at the polls in 1950
and 1952 as the President con-
fidently predicts, it will raise
the cost of all governments
from the present figure of
around $60,000,000,000 to some-
where between $80,000,000,000
and $100,000,000,000 in five
years.
This would involve an intol-
erable tax burden on a national
income of anything like the
present figure of $200,000,000,-
000. The simple political answer,
therefore, is to raise the nation-
al income, and the President
pulls an increase to $300,000,-
000,000 out of the air.

Now let us see what that
implies. To reach that figure it
will be necessary to do one of
two things: either to produce
enough inflation to increase the
dollar income to the higher fig-
ure, or to produce 50% more
goods and services.
A political administration
could easily reach the new fig-
ure by inflation. That, of course,
would be a hideous joke upon
the beneficiaries of the state,
for their "welfare" after the
event would be precisely what it
is now in terms of purchasing
power. It would, moreover, so
reduce the value of all savings
that the majority of the people
would have less than they had
before. Only the nonsavers
would benefit.
If inflation is not the objec-
tive, there is only one way to
increase the national income to
the higher figure. That is to
increase the production of goods
and services.
The writer of this column saw
an excellent example of that in
Aroostook County, Me., within
the last week. With incredible
energy and speed the farmers
up there are gathering in a
gigantic potato crop. In driving
through that region It is easy
to see that machinery and ma-
chinery alone is making larger
production possible—machinery
that digs the spuds, lifts the bar-
rels onto trucks and speeds the
trucks to the railroads and store-
houses. A veteran banker in the
county said that the race is all
in favor of the operator of the
large farm. The little ones are
falling behind, getting into debt,
selling out to big neighbors.

Increased tax returns come
from levies on big incomes in
that region, as well as in manu-
facturing, storekeeping, and
agriculture generally. So, if we
are to have a much higher tax
income, it will come from in-
creasingly large units.
But political expediency needs
the votes of the little fellows,
and the Truman administration
is looking that way. It is strik-
ing at large distributors such as
the A&P with antitrust actions,
at large farmers through the
Brannan Plan, and at big manu-
facturing units through heavier
burdens for welfare plans.
The administration is moving
toward lower production
through its alliance with labor
unions that seek fewer work-
ing hours. It is discouraging
investment in better machinery
by threats of nationalizing in
steel and elsewhere. And it is
reducing the possibility of plant
expansions through the use of
reserves by conniving with la-
bor to impose pension plans and
by higher taxes.
