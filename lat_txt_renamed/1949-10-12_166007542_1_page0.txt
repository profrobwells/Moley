President Truman seems to
have selected in Democratic
Chairman William M. Boyle Jr.
of Kansas City a man cut in his
own pattern of politics and, it
might be added, in the tradi-
tional pattern of Kansas City
machine politics.
Boyle dispatched telegrams to
all national committee members,
State chairmen and vice-chair-
men, asking them to tell their
respective Senators that "the
people" want Leland Olds con-
firmed as Federal Power Com-
missioner.
The President and his chair-
man thus pretend to be the es-
tablished oracles of "the
people." Senators who constitu-
tionally act as the chosen repre-
sentatives of the people of their
respective States are thus forced
to ignore their own sources of
information about a nomination
for office and their own knowl-
edge of what their people want
and listen to the true voice—
the President.
*
Without raising the question
of party loyalty, which the
President brought into his press
conference on the subject, let
us first consider the fiction that
"the people" have any direct
knowledge of or interest in Olds.
It is doubtful if one out of 100,-
000 ever heard of Olds before
this confirmation issue arose.
To prove his relative ano-
nymity, let me cite at personal
incident. A few weeks ago a very
well-known American called me
on the telephone to say that
Mrs. Roosevelt, in dictating one
of her endless magazine mem-
orabilia, had asked him for the
name of someone or anyone who
had advised her husband on
power policies while he was
Governor.
After scraping through the
dusty attic of my memory, I an-
swered that somebody who
worked in the New York State
government had submitted some
material for a Roosevelt speech
on power in 1932. Finally, I
came up with the name "Le-
land." Then, by association, the
name "Olds" was remembered.
But was it Olds Leland or Le-
land Olds?
My questioner, a vastly in-
formed man, had never heard
of him. Neither, apparently,
had Mrs. Roosevelt. So I checked
and double checked and found
that a man by the name of Le-
land Olds had worked in the
State government during Roose-
velt's service as Governor. We
then noted in passing that Olds
had later become a member of
the Federal Power Commission
—a fact that was apparently
news to both of us.
*
This is cited to show that the
name Leland Olds certainly
means nothing to the generality
of people. The reference by
Boyle to "the people" was there-
fore sheer buncombe.
He meant that Truman want-
ed Olds and that the heat was
to be put on Senators by a lot
of politicians who themselves
had probably never before heard
of Olds.
The Senators who had per-
formed their jobs of investigat-
ing the President's nomination
for office know all about Olds,
of course. A matter of this sort
is a Senator's sworn duty to
know. He cannot take a poll
of his constituents every time
he casts a vote. He must act
as the people's agent and use
his own judgment.
*
The President, too, must act
upon his own judgment. He
has no mandate from the peo-
ple on Olds, nor did his party
in conference nominate Olds.
So the matter is a question of
opinion, and the Senators must
act as the Constitution tells them
to do.
The heat implied is, of course,
a threat to the Senators that if
they do not surrender their
right of judgment, they will be
punished by the withholding of
patronage and by other means.
There is every evidence that the
Truman administration intends
to use the crudest political pres-
sure to enforce its will. This
will extend not only to patron-
age, but, as is shown in the
threatened prosecution of the
American Medical Association,
to the use of Federal law en-
forcement machinery to break
down opposition.
