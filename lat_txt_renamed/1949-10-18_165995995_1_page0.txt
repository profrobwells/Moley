Admirals Scoring Points
for Restudy of Defense
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Chairman Carl Vinson of the
House Armed Services Commit-
tee has rendered the country a
great service on two counts. He
has given the able and expe-
rienced heads of the Navy an op-
portunity in true American
fashion to present the Navy case
to the bar of public opinion.
And through this presentation
he has made it possible to tear
away all of the mystery and
some of the public fear of atomic
warfare.
The American people are
proud of the Navy. Over the
generations it has literally been
our major armed service. Its
officers have held a high place
in national lifeâ€”in public affec-
tion and respect and in wise
counsel to our government.
Because of the enormous
growth of the Army in the re-
cent war, the rise of air power,
the fact that the President is in
his sympathies an Army man
and because of the circum-
stances of unification in which
two services outvote the other,
the leaders of the Navy have
been subordinated and pre-
vented from making their
valued contribution to public
discussion of defense plans.
This is unfortunate, because
men like Nimitz, King, Halsey,
Spruance, Denfeld and many
others are not only national
heroes, but by the proof of
achievement great commanders.
Now they have had a hearing
and, as the smoke clears, a lot
of things are apparent that were
not seen before.
In the light of their expert
judgment, the present defense
setup is not real and effective
unification. The whole concept
must be revised and the top
personnel should be recast.
Clearly, the present Secretary
of the Navy, because of his lack
of force and experience, is un-
able to play an effective part in
top management. Whether Sec-
retary Johnson will be able to
demonstrate the capacity to win
public confidence remains to be
seen.
Also, in the light of the argu-
ment of the Navy men, the
whole present concept of armed
warfare must be revised. Faith
in strategic bombing has been
irreparably shaken. As Halsey
pointed out, the striking forces
of an enemy cannot be halted by
civilian destruction in the home-
land, except in a war of attri-
tion which might well destroy
all civilization.
Moreover, Admiral Ofstie in
a most persuasive statement
pointed out the moral values in-
volved, the dangers to ourselves
in delusions of quick victory and
the effect of such delusions on
diplomatic dealings with other
countries.
Finally, the atomic weapon
has been whittled down to life
size. It is a weapon and a dread-
ful one, but it cannot win a
war with Russia. It would be a
factor and possibly a decisive
factor, but many other weapons
and forces would be involved.
That can well be a corrective
for the blind fear that the atomic
bomb has introduced into public
thinking these past few years.
