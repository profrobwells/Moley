There are now more than
900,000 workers out on strike,
and every day further unem-
ployment develops because of
secondary influences. This is
not good news business-wise,
as Secretary of Commerce
Sawyer has advised us.
Even if all strikes are settled
at a relatively early date, the
injury to the late summer's
recovery will be serious. The
purchasing power of the nation
has already been set back by
half a billion, and that amount
is increasing daily.
★
The fact is that the pickup of
the past few months has been
exaggerated. It was believed
that the second quarter of this
year was poor but that the third
quarter was considerably better.
But figures on gross national
product now published show an
annual rate in the second
quarter of $256,000,000,000 and
for the third quarter, $255,000,-
000,000.
Some of this small decline is
due to strikes, but two addition-
al elements contributed deci-
sively. There was a decline in
exports, even before European
devaluation. Also, there was a
continued decline in business
investment at an annual rate
of $3,000,000,000.
The government's encourage-
ment to labor's pension plans,
which precipitated the steel
strike, has practically canceled
out the government's plan to
produce some inflation by pay-
ing veterans' life insurance
dividends. Those payments
have been going out for more
than a month, but with the
great loss of purchasing power
resulting from strikes, they will
not be enough to keep the
"boomlet" alive.

Moreover, if management
surrenders to the pension de-
mands, the victory will further
narrow purchasing power. It
has not been sufficiently
stressed that creating pension
funds will be mildly deflation-
ary. They have an economic
effect quite different from that
of wage increases. The money
is put away for another day. It
goes into bonds and long-term
securities and helps neither
purchasing power nor invest-
ment.
In addition to these economic
consequences, there are other
unfortunate results already ap-
pearing.
Farmers, in happy anticipa-
tion of new bins for surplus
products—a benefit of which
Truman has made so much—
are in for disappointment. No
steel, no bins. As a result, farm
products will deteriorate.
There will be a reduction of
inventories essential to normal
business.
Sharper antagonism among
workers—the favored few who
get pensions apart from all the
rest—will be bad for morale.
Political sentiment outside
organized labor will return to
pre-Taft-Hartley days. This will
sharpen the struggle in next
year's election. It will make any
revision of the act virtually im-
possible.
★
Finally, the involuntary un-
employment of many low-in-
come workers because of the
strikes of well-paid workers
will greatly contribute to de-
flationary currents.
Since the postwar inflation
has been leveling off for a year,
a precarious equilibrium will
be disturbed by losses in pur-
chasing power which will
spread throughout the economy.
Optimism will darken, even
after the strikes are somehow
settled.
