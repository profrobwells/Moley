Farm Aid Held Insincere,
Just Mad Race for Votes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As in most of the insinceri-
ties of politics the losers won
a "principle" and others won
the substance in the new farm
legislation.
Truman won his fight to get
Republican names off a basic
farm law and the names of
Democrats on a new one. The
advocates of fixed farm support
won substantially.
*
Those like the able and sin-
cere Senator and former Secre-
tary of Agriculture Clinton An-
derson won the doubtful prin-
ciple that at some time in the
future if surpluses pile up there
will be some reduction from the
90% supports. And Republicans
and Democrats alike, looking
toward 1950, have provided a
nice pile of campaign fodder to
tempt the ever hungry farm-
ers. The consumer, unorgan-
ized and voiceless, is the for-
gotten man.
The Aiken Act was con-
ceived, planned and passed as
a real effort to take the farm
question, temporarily at least,
out of politics. Anderson prop-
erly felt a responsibility for
maintaining the integrity if not
the name of the Aiken Act.
This was the general import of
the Anderson bill. Many House
Republicans, however, looking
toward 1950, yearned for 90%
supports. And so they went
along with Congressman Gore
against the Anderson plan. This
made it certain that the House
would win in conference.

On the economic side this
means a victory for the cotton
and wheat growers and for the
producers of fats and oils. They
get the highest prices they
could hope for during 1950.
After that there might theoreti-
cally be some reduction for the
six basic crops if a great over-
supply should develop. But
even so the floor would be 80%
in 1951 and not below 75% in
1952.
For figuring parity two for-
mulas exist. The old one based
upon the golden age of agricul-
ture, 1910-1914, and the new
one based upon the gilded age
of 1939-1948. The new law
generously gives the farmer
whichever formula will produce
the better price.
*
The economic consequences of
the new law are likely to be
these:
1-These high guarantees
will stimulate great production.
Farm surpluses are now so
large that further capital and
credit will have to be provided
for the CCC to the extent of a
third or more.
2-The next consequence will
be that the Secretary of Agri-
culture will probably be forced
to the agonizing decision of pro-
duction restrictions or the sur-
pluses will by 1951 be unstor-
able and unsupportable.
3-Since one of the most im-
portant by-products of cotton is
cottonseed and since cottonseed
is a basic source of fats and
oils, members of Congress rep-
resenting cotton interests must
provide supports for all fats
and oils, which are in consid-
erable oversupply already.
4-Some commodities with
less Congressional support did
not do so well. Eggs will be
seriously affected.
Politically this law merely
paves the way for a rivalry in
promises in 1950. The Bran-
nan plan will reappear as a
basic Truman bid.
