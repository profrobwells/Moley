If, as may well be, former
Gov. Herbert Lehman defeats
Sen. John Foster Dulles for the
Senatorship, the Fair Deal will
claim that the Truman program
has been endorsed. Thus political
capital will be made with
little justification.
For Lehman, despite his general
endorsement of welfare as
one of the major objectives of
government, disagrees in detail
with essential elements in the
President's program. He has
repudiated socialized medicine
as proposed by Oscar Ewing
and Sen. Murray, and has proposed
a plan of his own. The
Lehman proposals run closer to
those of Sen. Taft than to those
endorsed by President Truman.
The Brannan plan is anathema
to New York farmers, and
Lehman has not favored it.
Lehman has bowed to labor's
demand for Taft-Hartley repeal,
but his substitute would hardly
be a return to Wagner.
Moreover, there was nothing
in Lehman's record as Governor
that went far beyond Al Smith's
moderate views.
His strength against Dulles
lies in the fact that he is vastly
better known. In eight of 11
State elections he has been on
the ticket, twice for Lieutenant
Governor, four times for Governor,
twice for Senator.
Dulles is not well known generally
in New York. His life
has been in the higher ranges
of law practice, and his outside
activities have mainly been as
adviser to Gov. Dewey and as a
lay leader in interchurch movements.
He is, like Lehman, not
a colorful personality nor an inspiring
speaker.
Moreover, New York Democrats
who invariably continue
to bring religion and race into a
campaign, even while they
seem to deplore such tactics,
have been up to their old tricks.
Lehman and others have accused
Dulles of bigotry in a
manner designed to swing great
blocs of votes among various
religious and racial groups in
New York.
It is pretty shabby business
since Dulles has been striving
for years for tolerance and good
will among the sects. But New
York City voters are easy victims
of such insinuations, and
thousands will vote for Lehman
on religious grounds.
Another almost insuperable
handicap for Dulles is the fact
that Mayor William O'Dwyer is
running again. O'Dwyer has
been a fairly good Mayor. He
will get a big vote.
And so, if all these factors
elect Lehman it can hardly be
judged as a Fair Deal endorsement.
Dulles, vastly better equipped
for the Senate than Lehman,
will simply have been a victim
of circumstances having nothing
to do with the issue of the
welfare state.
