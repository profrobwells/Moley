Vast Income Gain Forecast
Based on Absurd Theories
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The bill recently dropped by
an adjourning Congress beside
the empty plate of Mr. Taxpayer
was $43,884,149,126. This in-
cludes direct and permanent ap-
propriations of $39,096,787,028
and contract authorizations of
$4,787,362,098. All for fiscal
1950.
These figures may not jibe
with other estimates of appro-
priations. Chairman Cannon of
the House Appropriations Com-
mittee has issued another fig-
ure, and Ex-Chairman Taber
still another. But this seems to
be the nearest approximation
of a total that is not easy to
compile.
It should be noted that this
total of appropriations is not an
indication of what the total
expenditures will be. In the
first place, there are some bil-
lions in appropriations made
last year or before which may
show up this year as expendi-
tures. And Congress in the ses-
sion beginning in January may
appropriate more.
Tax receipts are variously es-
timated. Several months ago
this column suggested receipts
of $38,000,000,000 or less as
against the Truman budget
estimate of $40,985,000,000. The
lower figure now seems certain
to come out.
Therefore, we are facing a
deficit of $6,000,000,000 or more.
Standing by itself, this in-
flationary force is not too seri-
ous. But political efforts to jus-
tify it may not only blind the
public to its danger, but set in
motion government policies
based on false reasoning, which
will invite disaster.
It is time to deflate the ridicu-
lous prophecies that the nation-
al income can be increased to
$300,000,000,000 "in a few
years," as Truman puts it. Un-
less this means merely a gigan-
tic inflation, such an estimate
is absurd in the light of all past
history. These fantasies must
originate in the Keyserling seo-
tor of the President's advisers.
The real basis of an increase
in national income is an in-
crease in real wealthâ€”in pro-
ductivity. Over the years it has
been shown with almost monot-
onous regularity that national
productivity increases only
about 2% a year. The Truman
claim of an increase of from 10
to 30% suggests an economic
miracle.
Strangely enough, even the
cautious Sen. George has sug-
gested that national income can
be raised to $260,000,000,000
or $300,000,000,000 in three
years. But Sen. George hedged
his estimate by stating that such
an increase could only be at-
tained if the tax structure were
rebuilt "to aid and assist all
producing elements."
This qualification saves Sen.
George, because only a miracle
could rebuild the tax structure.
With such a political administra-
tion as we have and with a
large part of Congress bidding
for labor votes, the lifting of
taxes to the degree suggested by
Sen. George simply cannot hap-
pen.
For to release real money for
venture capital would mean a
reduction of taxes on high per-
sonal and corporation incomes,
which Truman and his follow-
ers in Congress would never
permit.
The other danger in accepting
a deficit in a prosperous year
is the encouragement of a
theory that deficits are good.
Under the influence of spurious
economists, President Roosevelt
was induced from 1933 to 1939
to shift his ideas from devotion
to balanced budgets to a be-
lief that wealth could come
from government debt.
Deficits were first accepted
as a necessary evil, but never-
theless an evil. Next, they were
accepted as inevitable. And
finally, as beneficial. He "first
endured, then pitied, then em-
braced."
This dangerous course may
now be the Truman way.
