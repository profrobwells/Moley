Who Can Foresee Results
of Company-Paid Pensions?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The reason why the public
has had only small glimpses of
light about what this industrial
pension business means to each
worker, to every business, to the
consumer and to the country
generally is that neither the
unions nor the companies them-
selves know very much about it.
Under the ruthless pressure
of a paralyzing strike in steel
and coal and under the threat
of a strike in other industries,
agreements have been made or
are being made on the basis of
only a handful of facts. To call
the President's board a "fact-
finding" board was ridiculous.
Its report was made only on
what small light could be sup-
plied at the time it met, and its
recommendations were literally
pulled out of the air. Most im-
portant, it said that six months
should be required to figure it
all out—a warning which the
union leaders ignored.
Most of the steel companies,
particularly those which had no
pension plan at the outset of
trouble, ordered facts and fig-
ures from actuaries in a great
rush. Bethlehem was somewhat
better prepared because it al-
ready had a system. But even
then it took a month of negotia-
tion.
We may know with certainty,
however, that what is taking
place is the biggest problem
that ever faced American busi-
ness in our time.
Economists already have a
word for this movement. They
call this a new form of institu-
tionalism. Employers become
institutions, in a sense like the
great foundations and univer-
sities.
Employment policies will be
drastically changed, especially
in the smaller companies. It
will be harder and harder for
a man over 40 to get a job. The
companies that sign up to set
aside 6 cents an hour have set
up an almost insurmountable
obstacle to the hiring of men
over 40. But their answer can
be that they did this at the de-
mand of the unions, under
threats.
The steel companies have said
that on the basis of what they
can know now it will require,
in order to provide a pension
for everybody in all industry, a
fund of $55,000,000,000.
The growth of these great
funds, if pensions are to be
guaranteed by anything except
payment out of current profits,
will quickly provide a great
market for bonds. What bonds
will be suitable? Will companies
borrow from each other? This
would once more encourage the
kind of financing of which we
have already had too much.
The influence of New Deal
policies—emphasis on debt and
the decline of equity financing
—will be increased. It will ac-
centuate the growth of debt in
financial structures and the
danger that that offers in peri-
ods of depression. To the ex-
tent that borrowing at low in-
terest rates is extended, owners
of common stocks may get high-
er dividends in a condition of
inflation. But the risk will rise.
If money for pensions is raised
by borrowing within industry,
all business will become more
speculative.
If, as has been suggested, the
unions get a Federal law to re-
quire the investment of these
funds in government bonds, an-
other whole series of problems
will arise. With that market for
bonds, pressure for deficits will
rise.
We are entering new and un-
charted waters, and our mari-
ners are almost as ignorant of
what is ahead as we are.
