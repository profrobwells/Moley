Mrs. F. D. R. Writes of Snobs,
but Can't Pin It on Al Smith
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Mrs. Roosevelt in "This I Re-
member" disposes of her own
and her husband Franklin's
friends of the past.
There is no disposition in this
column to comment upon these
reminiscences. They seem to
convey the idea that Franklin
was pretty self-willed, that he
resented his mother's solicitous
concern about him, that he
largely conducted matters of
politics and statecraft without
Mrs. Roosevelt's advice and that
almost everyone around him
meant very little to him.
Mrs. Roosevelt's animadver-
sions about Gov. Alfred E.
Smith, however, deserve some
attention, particularly by those
who knew that statesman, ad-
mired him and believed he was
a luminous figure in a dull time.
Mrs. Roosevelt's comment on
Smith becomes a discourse on
snobbishness. Interest is lent
to her opinions because James
A. Farley seems to have started
her thinking about snobbishness
by his comments in "Jim Far-
ley's Story." Mrs. Roosevelt
says there are two kinds of snob
—the one who has "had a good
many opportunities and looks
down at those who lack them"
and the other, who is the self-
made man.
Smith, she says, "tended to
look down on a man who had
not met and conquered the situ-
ations he himself had—a man
like Franklin." In other words,
on Franklin.
In proof we are offered a con-
trast. There were Franklin's
simplicity, his love for eating
simple food in the humble pre-
cincts of his own home, his two-
dollar shirts and his two pairs
of shoes. On the other hand,
we are told of Al's good clothes,
his monumental desserts and
his love of eating out.
Mrs. Smith, as simple and
modest a woman as ever lived,
incidentally gets an indirect dig
in a reference to her "strands
of pearls."
The charge that Smith was a
snob really comes down to this:
"I always felt strongly that he
had a defensive attitude, which
arose, of course, from his con-
sciousness that he lacked
breadth of knowledge, for he
was too intelligent not to know
that he did not have a certain
kind of cultural background. It
often seemed to me that he
said things which were con-
temptuous of academic knowl-
edge simply to bolster his own
sense of security."
Now, as Al might say, let
us look at the record. Was he
"contemptuous of academic
knowledge"? His closest offi-
cial friend and foremost assist-
ant was Robert Moses, who, like
Roosevelt, inherited money and
had great academic opportuni-
ties—of which, it must be add-
ed, he made more than did
F. D. R.
Let it be added that to my
personal knowledge no Gover-
nor ever called upon more uni-
versity men than did Smith.
Long before there was any so-
called brain trust, this writer
and many other members of the
Columbia faculty served Smith.
In 1928 the venerable John
Dewey presented to Smith, in
behalf of faculty members of
400 American colleges, a glow-
ing message of their apprecia-
tion for Smith's service to edu-
cation.
Smith distrusted Roosevelt
and finally opposed him because
he believed that Roosevelt was
creating a class struggle in
America. This, too, is in the
record.
Mrs. Roosevelt wins no marks
for generosity by her attack up-
on a man who did so much for
her husband. And if she proves
a case of snobbishness, it is not
against Smith.
