Recruits Sought for Fight
Against Truman Socialism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A week ago I noted in a
magazine article that serious
efforts were under way to
form a nonpartisan national
organization to resist the Tru-
man supergovernment pro-
gram. The idea is to enlist
citizens of all parties, north
and south, behind a program
in line with American con-
stitutionalism to support the
rightful power and authority
of States and individual free-
doms, now endangered by
creeping Socialism at the
Federal level.
The response to that article
has already been enthusiastic.
There is clear evidence that
if the people now considering
the idea should go ahead there
will be widespread support.
The energies of the left have
been organized in various
ways. There are the Americans
for Democratic Action, the CIO
Political Action Committee
and other groups closely work-
ing in the same direction.
In certain places these
groups have virtually dominat-
ed the Democratic Party. They
claim credit, with a good deal
of justification, for pushing
the Truman administration
farther and farther toward the
welfare state. They are already
preparing to throw terrific
strength against Republican
and Democratic candidates in
next year's election.
To offer the millions who
would resist that trend an op-
portunity for united political
action would be the function
of a new, truly liberal group
â€”liberal in the sense of that
word before it was appropri-
ated by radicals.
The Republican Party would
greatly profit by this sort of
nonpartisan help. For a new
organization would have no
purpose of becoming a political
party. It could unite southern
and northern people in a way
impossible to the Republican
Party. It would provide a citi-
zens' group with objectives
similar to the Congressional
coalition that so far has had
to fight alone against the more
radical elements in the Tru-
man program.
Such a group would have to
organize itself with great care.
It would have to deny partici-
pation to extremists and reac-
tionaries who would bring
only discredit. It would have
to be essentially a group com-
posed of people of average or
less than average means,
reaching down into the grass
roots and the crossroads of
the country. Its program
should be a rational proposal
to avoid excessive government
spending, to promote sound
taxation, stable currency and
the avoidance of further ex-
tensions of the bureaucracy.
It should have a fair labor
policy designed to appeal to
the rank and file of labor.
It is a fact that the Repub-
lican Party is quite unprepared
for the great test of 1950. Its
finances are not ample, it lacks
a program and its leadership
is irresolute and divided. It
will take a long time to cor-
rect these weaknesses and un-
less other means of resisting
the Truman coalition are found
the nation will be pushed
farther along a dangerous road.
It is a fair estimate that a
large majority of Americans
are not in favor of the Truman
program. It is also clear that
thousands of those opposed are
outside both parties. They
should have a means of a fair
test at the polls. These are
some of the considerations that
offer a favorable prospect for
those who are considering a
new citizens' movement.
