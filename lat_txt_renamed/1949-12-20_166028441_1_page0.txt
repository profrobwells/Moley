The President
Can` Always
Find a Law
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The ban on Federal ald' for
any housing projects in which
discrimination is practiced
came with an extraordinary
array of administration au-
thority.
The Solicitor. General of the
United States was apparently
chosen to announce it. That
pointed to the authority of the
Solicitor General's superior,
Atty. Gen. McGrath. Then,
to double-rivet the rule, the
President himself announced
through his secretary that
"this is the administration
policy."
Thus, through the use of
power and money intended to
expedite the building of
houses for the people of the
country, there is enforced a
declaration in the last Demo-
cratic platform which was
jammed through against vio-
lent protest and apparently
without the approval of the
resolutions committee itself.
The ensuing civil rights pro-
gram was refused by Con-
gress, despite the urging of the
President.
The administration's tech-
nique is not new. The meth-
od consists of using one piece
of legal authority to enforce
a purpose which has not been
specifically granted by law.
Roosevelt used it often. When
his pet project to tax undis-
tributed profits and to force
management against its own
business judgment to pay
dividends-had been repealed
by Congress, the President's
purpose was achieved through
the exercise of Treasury dis-
cretion under the famous Sec-
tion 102 of the revenue law.

In the housing matter, the
new rule is to refuse any Fed-
eral aid, either in loans or in-
surance, unless the receiver of
such benefits promises to im-
pose no restrictions on the ba-
sis of race, creed or color.
As was suggested here some
months ago, this exercise of
power has been under consid-
eration for some time. The de-
lay has been occasioned by a
long search by the the legal
brains of the administration
for a plausible legal justifica-
tion for such an order. The
search has apparently. been
successful. The timing of the
move has also been nicely cal-
culated to prepare the way for
another attempt to force
through a civil rights program
in the coming session of Con-
gress.
The effect of this action will
be a drastic reduction of pri-
vate building.
One builder has pointed out
that government. housing au-
thorities may still build sepa-
rate projects for whites or
Negroes, while under this rul-
ing private builders may not
do so with the aid of govern-
ment.
If further proof be needed
that the ramifications of gov-
ernment aid threaten almost
every essential liberty, this ac-
tion provides it. Under this al-
leged principle, every business
receiving aid from a govern-
ment lending agency might be
compelled to conform to gov-
ernment's ideas of business
management.
States receiving school aid
would, despite the disclaimers
of the advocates of that policy,
be required to select teachers
and prescribe texts and courses
of study in conformity with the
dictates of politicians in Wash-
ington. A government that
helps all will eventually regi-
ment all.
