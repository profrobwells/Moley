There's Really No Such Thing
as a Two-Party System
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Since the birth of our re-
public, statemen, philosophers
and historians have been tell-
ing us that the most effective
way to preserve democracy and
run the government is through
a strong two-party system.
They have been right, and
now and then and here and
there we have seen the proof
of their wisdom. But it can
be shown without much trou-
ble that neither in the major
parts of the North or South
is there a really effective party
system at all.
Since 1860 there has been
no two-party system in the
South, and all the evidence in-
dicates that we shall not have
a real Republican Party there
for years to come.
In the North there has been
a smug acceptance of a belief
that a real two-party system
exists there. This belief, how-
ever, needs radical revision
at this time. For there is ample
evidence that, whatever may
have existed in the past, the
North has really effective two-
party systems in not more than
half of its States.
In some States where Repub-
lican supremacy has been
maintained over a number of
years, the Democratic Party
has shrunk to a mere shadow.
In a few States the Republi-
can Party is in almost complete
dissolution. In a few, like New
York and Michigan, neither
party has a true majority. Both
must compromise with splin-
ter parties or political labor
groups to win an election.
In California the two parties
are so fragmentized that elec-
tions and primaries can be
won only by personalities.
Everywhere there are differ-
ences between personalities
and factions within a party
as great as there are between
the parties themselves. Nomi-
nal Republicans like Sens.
Morse, Langer and Tobey bear
much more ideological identi-
ty with Truman than with
Taft.
What really holds the Demo-
cratic Party together in the
North and South under Tru-
man is a Federal machine com-
posed of hundreds of thousands
of officeholders gradually be-
ing welded together as a dis-
ciplined occupation force, tak-
ing orders from GHQ in Wash-
ington and armed with Feder-
al benefits and grants to win
the people's votes.
In the midst of this situation
of party weakness there is be-
ing presented to the people
a momentous public issue,
possibly the greatest since the
issue of union and slavery.
It is the extent to which our
economy will be socialized by
the program of the welfare
state. The drawing of this issue
and its test at the polls can-
not wait for the reconstruction
of parties nor for the formu-
lation of new ones. It can be
met only by citizens' action
in districts and States to help
the candidates of both parties
who offer the promise of re-
sisting the trend to the left.
