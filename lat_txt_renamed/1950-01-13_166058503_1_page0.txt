It's Time to Freeze RFC;
Private Credit Is Better
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For many reasons the RFC
is in an unhappy spot. It is a
most certain that it will be in-
vestigated by the Senate next
year. Some of the recipients of
its loans have been receiving
very unpleasant publicity.
Even President Truman is said
to be considering a transfer of
its functions to the Treasury
or the Federal Reserve Board.
The cold-blooded intentions
of some administration master-
minds to use the RFC as a
means of pushing the govern-
ment more deeply into busi-
ness have been publicized, and
that has not helped matters.

One comment is that
through the RFC a sort of
Brannan plan in business
could be achieved, with loans
doing what subsidies do for
farmers. This is possible be-
cause the RFC in its original
form and with amendments
has vast powers which have
not been fully exercised. One
of the New Deal attorneys of
the RFC used to say that prac-
tically all of the New Deal re-
forms could have been
achieved under the powers of
his institution without the
need for any of the alphabeti-
cal creations of Roosevelt.
This power was freely grant-
ed and safely held while Jesse
Jones was the boss. But the
RFC without Jones is "Ham-
let" without Hamlet. Smaller
hands have inherited its great
powers.

Of course, the RFC should
have been frozen years ago or
immediately after the war. It
was created to meet crisis con-
ditions which no longer exist.
It should have been limited to
the simple job of liquidating
its loans and of standing in
readiness for a possible future
economic crisis. Its lending
power should have been anes-
thetized.
But its political potentiali-
ties could not be overlooked by
a political administration. And
so it lived on, subject to all
sorts of pressures and pulls.
The task force of the Hoover
Commission recommend-
ed that the RFC be discon-
tinued. The majority of the
Commission followed the task
force recommendations part of
the way. It recommended that
the Congress should review
the whole subject of direct
loans and that in nonemer-
gency periods restrictions
should be. placed on direct
loans and that in nonemer-
gency periods the normal
channels of private credit
should be used, with perhaps
a restriction of the govern-
ment's part to guarantees.
Three members of the Com-
mission dissented.

What is needed is the crea-
tion of a credit pool of funds
supplied from private sources
which can lend risk capital for
long terms. Complaints that
capital of that sort cannot be
obtained from private sources
arise because individual insti-
tutions cannot legally or mor-
ally take such chances. But
they could afford participation
in a larger pool in which risk
could be widely distributed.
The fact is that such an in-
stitution, perhaps with a setup
similar to the Federal Reserve
System, might not only meet
the needs of domestic borrow-
ers, but take some of the load
of foreign aid.
