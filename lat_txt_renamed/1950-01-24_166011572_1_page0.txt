After long deliberation, the
British Labor Cabinet has de-
cided to risk its fate in an elec-
tion on Feb. 23. The campaign
is getting under way, although
custom decrees that the major
effort will be made during the
three February weeks before
the election.
Various circumstances lim-
ited the choice of a campaign
to this period or to May or
June. Good observers believe
that the national interest, as
well as that of the Labor
Party, would have been better
served by a dissolution of Par-
liament and an election last
fall. But with characteristic
hesitancy and fumbling, the
Labor Cabinet failed to call
the turn earlier.
A February election will im-
pose handicaps on all con-
cerned. The size of the audi-
ences and the size of the vote
will be reduced by bad weath-
er. Whether this will favor
the Conservatives is a difficult
question. No one seems able
to hazard an answer.
Viewed objectively, it looks
as if the odds favor a Labor
majority but by a considerably
reduced number of seats.
The Liberal Party, which has
dwindled to 10 seats in the
present Parliament, is out to
recover some of its former
power. It plans to put candi-
dates into about 400 constitu-
encies. It is hardly likely to
win more than 20 or 30 of
these, but it is gambling for
an important advantage. If
the margin between the Con-
servatives and Labor should
be close, a small Liberal group
might hold the balance of
power.
If Labor returns to power
by a considerably reduced ma-
jority, its future will be rough
and dangerous. However the
election comes out, British dif-
ficulties will grow greater and
greater. That may well mean
that confidence in such a gov-
ernment would decline and a
new election would be held
soon—perhaps within the year.
On issues, the Conservatives
decidedly have no great ad-
vantage. They are compelled
to support much of the Social-
ist program of Labor, partly
because the Conservatives in
past years started many of
those schemes, partly because
the public has become depend-
ent upon government help, and
mostly because modern Brit-
ish Conservatism is unable to
invent a new and promising
road away from Socialism. Its
attitude, expressed in Ameri-
can political terms, will be
“me-too-but-better.”
British Conservatism
has lost much of the vitality
of former days. It began as a
party in the early years of
Disraeli a century ago. It had
powerful elements for a politi-
cal movement.
As Disraeli put it, the Con-
servative Party was the politi-
cal agent of the great British
institutions—the church, the
universities, the nobility, the
grant land holdings; the finan-
cial “city,” and the imperial in-
fluence abroad.
Most of these institutions
have declined in importance,
especially during the late war.
Financial power ceases to ex-
ist when foreign investments
are lost, trade is reduced and
prestige is at a low ebb.
When a population is strug-
gling for bare necessities, it
may decide to take no further
risks.
