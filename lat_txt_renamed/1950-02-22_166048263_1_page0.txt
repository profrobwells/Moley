LONDON—Now, in the final
week of the British election
campaign, the question every-
one will be asking is "What
are the prospects?"
To that question I address
myself with some caution,
since the memory of the 1948
election in the United States
is still green—or perhaps it
would be better to say purple.
This is written after visits to
several constituencies in Eng-
land and Scotland, after hear-
ing leading figures in the cam-
paign perform before public
meetings, and after a good
many contacts with all sorts
of people in London.
*
If the answer is somewhat
vague, it is because there has
never been an election in
which there were so many im-
ponderables. It is also because
during the final days before
election day—Thursday—there
may well be sensational devel-
opments.
Things are already approach-
ing white heat. Nerves are
tightening in leading cam-
paigners on both sides. Sir
Stafford Cripps has already
uttered some Billingsgate in
pure English, and Churchill
has advised a rest cure for
him. Among lesser lights, the
vocabulary of abuse is being
well dredged.
It is still hard to measure
the introduction into the cam-
paign of Churchill’s proposal
for direct talks in Moscow. His
suggestion may well turn
things sharply toward the Con-
servatives, because the British
people are thoroughly sick of
all war, including the cold
war.

Three possibilities lie ahead.
The first is a Labor victory
with a reliable working ma-
jority. In 1945 Labor’s mar-
gin was 146. Even Labor lead-
ers have no expectation of
such a victory this time. In
considering this first possibil-
ity, this American observer
has in mind the five years fol-
lowing 1933, when the New
Deal was sweeping everything
before it. The momentum of
political revolution is not easi-
ly stopped.
There is a sense among the
British people, as there was in
America, that something has
been done. There is no critical
examination of all that has
been done, just a sense of mo-
tion. Moreover, the British
people have no real apprecia-
tion of the critical economic
situation before them.
The second possibility is a
narrow Conservative majority.
There is great dissatisfaction
with the progress of the Labor
Party in housing and some dis-
content with shortages and
high prices. Churchill is vastly
more effective than he was in
1945. Lord Woolton is a
splendid campaign manager.
The Conservatives are work-
ing very hard and very effec-
tively in many close constitu-
encies. They claim notable
gains in pre-election canvass-
ing. The polls are running
about even.
Most independent opinion
holds to the third possibility—
that Labor will win by a
majority, but considerably
under 100 seats, perhaps even
less than 50. This would be too
small a margin to guarantee a
vote of confidence under all
circumstances.
*
For many of the reasons
stated above, Labor is facing
serious difficulties. The middle
classes, to which they have
addressed their main argu-
ments, are being pressed
heavily by the effort to carry
the classes below them at
government expense. Even
among the ranks of Labor it-
self, many women concerned
with household budgets will
vote against the party of their
husbands. There seems to be
a great deal of sense in this
third possibility.
In any event, in total figures
there will be a substantial ma-
jority against Socialism. That
is almost certain. In 1945, the
balance in favor of Socialism,
after taking account of all
parties, was only 65,000 in a
total vote of 24,000,000. The
voting weather was better then
than it is now. Therefore,
there may be a smaller poll.
The Liberals will probably poll
many more than their 2,225,000
of 1945. They are now contest-
ing 50% more constituencies
than in that year. This should
mean perhaps nearly a million
more votes.
*
The final consideration will
be weather. If there is rain or
snow or both, it is believed
that the Conservatives will
have the advantage.
That analysis, inconclusive
as it is, represents about the
only honest answer that can
be made to the question of
prospects.
