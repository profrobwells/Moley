Aneurin Bevan Is Causing
the Labor Party Some Pain
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
LONDON â€” The future of
the Labor Party depends to a
considerable degree on the
moods, ideas and conduct of
Aneurin Bevan. The election
has strengthened that belief.
Bevan has been off the res-
ervation. He did not appear at
the post-mortem Cabinet meet-
ing after the returns were in,
although apparently he was in
London. Downing Street made
a rather lame explanation of
his absence. In subsequent
visits of the party leaders to
the perplexed Prime Minister,
Bevan has not been mentioned.
Achilles indubitably stays in
his tent. And there is as much
need for him as there was for
the prize battler among the
Greeks before Troy.
Attlee, Morrison and others
who are trying to reform the
ranks cannot very well eject
this hard lump of dissent as
they have done before with re-
calcitrant comrades. Bevan is
too big for that sort of treat-
ment; he has too many radical
followers within the party, and
the party is in too desperate
a situation to spare anyone.
The centers of opposing poli-
cy in the Labor Party are Bev-
an and Herbert Morrison, with
Attlee leaning toward Morri-
son. If a final showdown
comes, these two will battle it
out and the Labor Party may
not recover from the effects
for a long time.
Bevan is a natural leader of
masses and as such has be-
come over the years noticea-
bly intoxicated by his own ora-
torical powers. He has come
to believe in his heart what
he has made audiences believe
through his rhetoric. Savona-
rola proved centuries ago that
an orator ultimately becomes
the prisoner of his own
speeches. He must proceed to
new heights of denunciation
and exhortation or his listen-
ers will fall away. Ultimately
he falls victim to his own ut-
terances unless, as is some-
times the case, he attains dic-
tatorial power. For after all
the superlatives have been
used, there is no room for
those reticences and compro-
mises by which leadership is
held in a democracy.
Morrison, on the other hand,
is a practical politician. He is
concerned with power, but an-
other form of power. He is
not willing to press the ex-
treme demands of Socialism if
by moderation he can carry
some of the votes of the middle
classes.
But since the very founda-
tions of Socialism are in eco-
nomic revolution, Morrison's
view will ultimately be con-
fronted by Bevan's in mortal
conflict. That, of course, is
what makes Socialism so dan-
gerous. You must either reck-
on to take all of it in the end
or you must find the line
where justice ends and equali-
tarianism begins.
The thing to watch from
here on is not the nice maneu-
vering in the coming session,
which may be brief, but what
ultimately happens within the
Labor Party.
