Why Britain
Didn't Raise
Medical Issue
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
LONDON—It will surprise
American doctors and others
that in the British election campaign
just concluded there was
very little discussion of the
Labor Party's great adventure
in government medicine. This
was partly because early development
of the plan was in
the wartime coalition government.
The main outlines were
contained in the so-called
white paper of 1944. The Conservatives,
therefore, bear a
certain responsibility.
Even in a sensational speech
on behalf of the Conservative
cause by Dr. Charles Hill, secretary
of the British Medical
Association, there was comparatively
minor mention of
health matters. But if the Conservatives
get into power there
will be some reorganization
of the system and it may be
that Dr. Hill will become Minister
of Health. The doctor,
incidentally, was elected to
Parliament on combined Liberal
and Conservative tickets.
Moreover, so far as surface
appearances go, most of those
in the medical profession have
become reconciled to the system,
and there seems to be
no inclination on the part of
the British Medical Association
to make a further fight.
The original National Health
Service Act was full of grave
defects, and a determined effort
was made to amend it.
This was accomplished in 1949.
Amendments passed at that
time definitely ruled out the
danger of reducing the practitioner
to a full-time salaried
status. They also preserved for
the doctor the right to a private
practice.
The fact is that the medical
profession has retained or
gained substantial control of
the system, with the government
paying the bill.
But anyone who might expect
this freedom to remain
would reveal a poor conception
of the ways of governments.
If the Socialists had
returned to power with a
substantial majority and with
Aneurin Bevan high in that
government, the strings would
have been progressively tightened.
In my own conversation
with Bevan he made it clear
that, since the government had
taken over the hospitals, this
would ultimately put the government
in a commanding
position with respect to any
doctors who might find it essential
to their practice and
standing to have hospital connections.
The dangerous thing about
the British health system and
a factor which should be carefully
considered in adopting
any scheme of the sort in the
United States is the excessive
cost. The original estimate for
the national health service for
last year was about £260,-
000,000. But after a few months
the government prepared a
supplemental estimate which
probably will amount to several
million pounds more.
No one had guessed how
many people would have real
or imaginary need for medical
or dental care. Unless some
means can be found to determine
the real need, it is hard
to see how any such system
can be financed.
