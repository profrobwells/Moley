LONDON—In a previous column it was noted that the cost of free medical and dental care in Britain has been mounting at a rate which may well become an excessive burden on the taxpayer. But the health service is only one of many social services involved in the British concept of a welfare state.
When the new Labor government presents its budget in April, it will be possible for Americans to get a full picture and to reflect upon the possible consequences of a similar line of policy in the United States. Meanwhile, a few figures may be offered to indicate the general trend of costs and the burden of those costs upon the taxpayer.

The first good test of the new health system was the fiscal year 1948-49. The original estimate of the cost to the national treasury for that year was £200,000,000. As the year proceeded, it was necessary to supplement that, and the final cost was £278,000,000. According to the advocates of the plan that was not large, considering the fact that the total outlays of the Exchequer were £3,000,000,000. For the present fiscal year, now nearly over, the original estimate was £260,000,000. By this time the system was better known and people were awakening to the vast potentialities of John (Santa Claus) Bull. The result has been a supplemental estimate for the service which will probably amount to several million pounds in addition. The Labor government must go to Parliament with this demand this month.
But as noted above, the health service is only one of the services of the welfare state. There are also education, for which the estimate was £225,000,000; housing, £66,000,000; family allowances, £60,000,000; national insurance funds, £117,000,000, and national assistance, £56,000,000. Including the health program and not counting supplemental estimates, that makes a total of £814,000,000. To this should be added food subsidies costing £165,000,000.
The total cost of government, including these more or less direct gifts, comes to 40% of the national income. To put it in concrete terms, it means that the government is spending 40% of the people's income for them. The payment of these sums through taxation means, of course, that some are paying for others.
But the British people, like the American people, little realize how much is collected in taxes from the very people who are getting the benefits. Indirect taxes, which are generally paid by the poor, were 5 shillings a week per capita in 1938. Last year those taxes amounted to more than 15 shillings a week per capita.
This process through which people slowly sell their control over their own earnings and savings is inherent in the welfare state. And it is fostered, of course, by the Socialist doctrine that the state is better able to spend the people's money than they are themselves. That is really what Attlee and others mean by the sweet word "planning."
