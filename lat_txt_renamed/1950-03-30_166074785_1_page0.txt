PORTLAND, Me. - Last
September when I visited
Aroostook County in this State,
just as the last spud was torn
from the ground and popped
into a barrel, I was reminded
of the complaint of Jeremiah,
"The harvest is past; the sum-
mer is ended, and we are not
saved."
For I was told by bankers
and businessmen in Presque
Isle and Ft. Kent that bank de-
posits were falling and the
1948 boom in potatoes would
never be repeated. There was
plenty of evidence of govern-
ment-promoted prosperityâ€”
fine new automobiles, new
houses and new paint. But, so
far as the smaller potato grow-
ers were concerned, their lot
was not so good.
It was not hard to see one
good reason for the drop as I
drove beyond Maine into New
Brunswick and Quebec. For
what was sauce for the goose
was sauce for the gander.
Providence sees no national
boundaries, and our Canadian
cousins were also harvesting
potatoes. Behind their potato
industry were more favorable
economic conditions. Since no
bounteous Truman administra-
tion had poured a golden flood
into their pockets, the Cana-
dians had enjoyed no sharp
rises in costs. More frugal
governments had kept their
taxes lower. And a shrewder
government policy was help-
ing them to market their crops,
rather than buying their prod-
uct at an inflated price.
The result has been that, de-
spite an immense domestic po-
tato crop, the Canadians have
succeeded in marketing their
potatoes in the United States.
They have also beaten us to
foreign markets.
Maine potato growers have
had to encounter the restric-
tions of our maritime unions,
and the cost of shipping in
American bottoms is high.
Of course, Maine potatoes
could have been bought once
more by a generous govern-
ment at the high prices of 1948.
But, fearing another scanda-
lous handout like that year,
our Agriculture Department
lowered the support price and
restricted the acreage.
The result is that Maine
farmers would, if they could,
tell the farmers of many other
States that there is no silver
lining in a cloud of govern-
ment checks. Like the pretty
trail of a Roman candle, it is
fine while it lasts. But after-
ward the night seems darker.
The wry aspects of the Tru-
man potato policy have been
well advertised before this.
The news in Aroostook
County, six months after my
last visit, is still worse. Bank
deposits are still falling, and
unemployment is rising. Mean-
while, Maine philosophers take
comfort from history as they
look toward the time when the
country as a whole will no
longer pay farmers to raise all
sorts of crops for which there
is no market.
Before the New Deal was
born, there were huge and un-
wanted crops of Maine pota-
toes. There was one such crop
in 1925. And then, as now,
Canada raised a big crop and
beat us to the market. That
stimulated Maine producers to
consider the many uses to
which potatoes could be put,
other than in adding calories
to the diet.
But the most important les-
son the potato has to teach all
American farmers is not to
put faith in government. For
all the ingenuity in the world
will not save growers of prod-
ucts, from corn to peanuts,
when taxpayers finally realize
that it is politics, not econom-
ics, that pays people to raise
crops for which there is no
market.
