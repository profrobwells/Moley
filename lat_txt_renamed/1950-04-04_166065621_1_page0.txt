It is unfortunate that it
took the issue of Communism
and Communist sympathy to
bring out clearly the sad state
of our State Department. Long
before the Communist Issue
arose, there was need for a
general rehabilitation of our
foreign office and Foreign
Service.
This need goes back beyond
Truman, beyond Roosevelt, and
is rooted in the very vitals and
traditions of the department.
Secretary Hughes in the
early 20s saw the problem of
personnel and secured the pas-
sage of the Rogers Act, which
strengthened the career serv-
ice and provided better tests
of training and qualifications.
Rut this act failed to do much
beyond pushing party politics
into the background. The
problem was not and is not
the need for career men. It
was and is the need for a kind
of men who make diplomacy
a career. It relates to what
happens to them in the course
of that career.

When Roosevelt entered the
White House in 1933, he was
aware of the need for a gen-
eral administrative house
cleaning in the State Depart-
ment. But in the rush of re-
forms elsewhere, his attention
was drawn away.
His appointment of Cordell
Hull was made for several
reasons. One was his long-
standing respect and affection
for the Tennessee Senator. He
regarded Hull as an idealist in
the realm of foreign trade and
in the pursuit of peace, but
also as a somewhat impractical
man and an inexperienced ad-
ministrator.
Hull frankly made a condi-
tion of his appointment that
he should have no real re-
sponsibility for the administra-
tive machinery of the depart-
ment. To fill this need, Roose-
velt appointed William Phil-
lips as Undersecretary to
"run" the department. But
Phillips was a career man who
seemed to find nothing wrong
in the career service. The
same was true of Phillips'
successor, Sumner Welles. It
was true later with Dean
Acheson as Undersecretary,
and it is true today under Ache-
son as Secretary.
Meanwhile, the department
grew awkwardly, indiscrimi-
nately, prodigiously. In 1933
the department cost $17,073,-
386. This year it costs $314,-
388,065.
Resistance to change is in-
herent in such a privileged
and protected bureaucracy.
Its members pull together and
offer a hostile front to any-
one who enters the sanctum
without traditional training in
their ways. No one knows that
better than the writer of this
column, who was appointed
Assistant Secretary of State
for a few months in 1933, not
to manage State Department
affairs, but to help the Presi-
dent with his domestic pro-
gram.
Despite the fact that this as-
signment was made clear, the
bureaucracy seemed fearful
that something of a reorganiza-
tion was in store. And when
I left to take up the much
more agreeable task of a jour-
nalist, there was joy and no
little sniping.
What is needed is a strong
noncareer Secretary of State
who has the capacity to re-
build the department as Lord
Haldane rebuilt the British
army before World War I.
Loyalty in the technical
sense should be enforced, but
the greater need is a general
infusion of new, clean blood.
