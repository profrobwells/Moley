Unemployment Is Partly Due
to Industrial Pension Plans
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Philip Murray recently re-
ported the figure of unemploy-
ment in February at 4,684,000.
The Census Bureau has since
reported an employment in-
crease of 600,000. Murray stat-
ed that the "danger point" is
5,000,000.
It may be interesting to ask
why that figure is called a
"danger point." Perhaps it is
because the President's eco-
nomic advisers say so. But,
considering the fact that
those economists and the
President are eager to bring
in government aid, they are
glad to put the danger point
as low as possible. It is diffi-
cult to fix any specific figure
as a danger point until we
know where the unemploy-
ment is and what caused it.
Clearly, it is a regional mat-
ter. I have just visited Cali-
fornia and Texas-in that or-
der. Southern California has
a marked rise in unemploy-
ment. But there was no evi-
dence of it in Texas. Similar
variations must be true all
over.
â˜…
California is afflicted for
several reasons. Too many
people have moved to that
State in recent years, with no
reasonable expectation of find-
ing jobs. The wonder is that
the situation is not worse and
that it did not appear in the
years before this one. And, con-
sidering the fluidity of much
of the population in that State,
some allowance of time should
be made for the migrants to
migrate again before Wash-
ington gets alarmed.
In another two months
some hundreds of thousands
of college and high 'school
graduates will be cast upon the
job market, and that will in-
crease the unemployment fig-
ures. But that flood of appli-
cants cannot be taken care
of by the government over-
night. It is a perennial prob-
lem.
Mr. Murray and his ally,
President Truman; have
caused a considerable part of
the new unemployment them-
selves. By forcing industries
to rush into industrial pension
plans, they have invited a
large dropping of older men.
The enforced adoption of pen-
sion plans has legitimately
frightened employers, and
that has caused readjustments
which might never have been
necessary. In any event, many
older people are looking for
jobs, and they are advised
from many sides to approach
smaller companies that are
still free from pension threats.
The situation generally is
far from alarming, despite the
scare words of Murray and the
government. It is no time to
follow the idea of Secretary
of Labor Tobin to revive the
Civilian Conservation Corps
of blessed New Deal memory.
That was a welfare project,
and the outgrowth of a long
depression. Even the sugges-
tion of a revival makes one
wonder if Tobin is expecting
a big depression-a Truman
depression this time. To sug-
gest it now is a confession of
alarm.
If the administration is look-
ing for a danger point, it ought
to turn its eyes to the rising
deficit. Our expenditures
reached the danger point a
long time ago.
