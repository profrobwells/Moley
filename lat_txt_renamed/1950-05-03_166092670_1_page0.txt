Fair Deal Attack on Steel
Shows Aim of Full Control
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The recent appearance of
Chairman Leland Olds and
President Benjamin Fairless
of United States Steel before
the Celler House committee
on monopolies and what-not
once more shows evidence of
the bitterness of the Fair Deal
toward the steel industry, especially toward U.S. Steel.
Superficially considered, this
is strange. According to Fair
Deal standards, U.S. Steel has
been a "liberal" company. Its
concessions to labor have been
so broad that the company has
been regarded elsewhere in
business as a fairly "radical"
one. Its efforts to appease the
administration in other ways
have been notable.
But if we dig into motives
below the surface, some explanations are possible. The
company is big and its operations are far-reaching. It is
an essential prop in the government's defense program. It
is a key bastion in the general economy, which Trumanism regards as dominated
by "special interests." Moreover, the radical elements in
the administration, who in
semianonymity control much
of its planning, have always
used steel as a focal point in
their attacks.
The pattern of the attack
on steel closely follows that
of the British Labor Party in
its arguments a year ago when
it prepared the way for steel
nationalization. It was held
then that Britain's recovery
was retarded by the slow
growth of the industry, that
government could build up
production faster and that it
could introduce more efficiency.
Can it be that the whole attack on business by the Fair
Deal, which is most intense in
the steel sector, is designed to
lessen the power of big companies to meet emergencies
and to make a case for government production in the interest of national safety?
Surely if industry is to be
broken into little pieces there
will be no possibility of turning to industry for such rapid,
large-scale production as characterized the onset of the recent war.
Bigness apparently is respectable only in labor unions
and in government.
