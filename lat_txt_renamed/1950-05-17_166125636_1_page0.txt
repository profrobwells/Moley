Fair Employment Practices
Bill Seen as Political Bluff
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Several arguments have
been advanced for the fair
employment practices bill,
now before Congress, that
should be dragged out for close
examination. For if a piece of
legislation is enacted under
the persuasive influence of
fallacious reasons, we shall
have fallacious law.
The President's Committee
on Civil Rights, from which
this measure was derived, in-
cluded lawyers, and at least
one was a good lawyer. But it
argued in a manner that would
hardly be adequate in any
court. It used the old tricks
of political dialectic.
One argument, embellished
with a fine chart elaborately
drawn, was intended to show
the great number of discrimi-
natory acts by employers and
others.
*
These compilations of al-
leged cases of discrimination
also showed cases by race and
religion. This illustrative ma-
terial was drawn from the
records of the old fair employ-
ment practices set up by Pres-
ident Roosevelt to deal with
discrimination in the war
effort.
The "cases" cited were com-
plaints. They were not proved
cases.
Another argument seriously
advanced is that it is a good
thing to pass a law in the
hope that it will never be
used. Thus, Congress is asked
to pass a law with severe pen-
alties in it and involving a big
bureaucracy, which is after all
designed merely as a piece of
moral advice.
Another argument advanced
by the new Senator, Benton of
Connecticut, is that Russia
and other nations reached by
the Voice of America—which
the Senator used to run—will
be deterred from accusing the
United States of denying peo-
ple their civil rights.
Aside from the ridiculous
idea that Russia could impress
even its satellites with a tale
about civil rights, this argu-
ment is rooted in the propost-
tion that laws are seriously to
be passed by Congress, not for
the maintenance of peace and
justice at home, but for use
as propaganda abroad.
Of course, the present bill
affects only 2% of of all enter-
prises in the United States. It
is intended to apply only to
larger companies.
Note that it is not based on
the idea that those big employ-
ers are the only ones who
should be regulated. Still, it
is suggested that Federal law
is needed because general ap-
plication is needed. This, how-
ever, is not a general law. It
is aimed at a tiny minority to
satisfy another minority.
That may be good politics,
but it is a very poor way to
legislate.
