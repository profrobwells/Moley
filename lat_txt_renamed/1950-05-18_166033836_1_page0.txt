Actors and Lines Change,
but the Plot Is the Same
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Whoever indulges in the
dream that somehow people
will toil hard enough for self-
enlightenment to appreciate
and rebuff the moth-eaten ar-
guments that politicians use
will be saddened to read the
Truman speeches on the tour
just ended. For, having won an
election with these posers, plat-
itudes and fallacies, the Pres-
ident and his assorted speech
writers feel that the public de-
serves nothing better.
Some of these tricks with
logic and history are as old
as Aristotle. The old Greek de-
voted a whole book to them.
But they still seem to work,
after more than 2000 years.
*
One of them is the trick by
which a speaker represents
himself as a shining figure of
noble proportions against a
dark background filled with
sinister and benighted enemies.
To borrow another classic ex-
ample, this is like the medieval
morality plays, in which some
allegorical hero like Charity or
Faith beats the enemies of so-
clety with sticks or blown-up
bladders. In political oratory,
the enemies need not be
named. They are, in fact, pure-
ly imaginary, and they are first
mentioned and then vaguely
quoted by way of introduction.
Then the speaker whacks them
with verbal sticks or bladders;
the crowd cheers, and the fig-
ures scurry into the darkness.
In Wyoming, Truman re-
ferred to a "stuffy reactionary
Easterner" who in 1853 said
that to give women the vote
was against the Bible. This
was a magazine editor; by the
way, and he wrote that silly
statement long before Wyo-
ming was admitted to the Un-
ion. The doughty President
took the measure of this shade
and went on to others.

Then there were "reaction-
ary forces who opposed every
proposal to increase the pros-
perity of the West." Since
1933 "we have been overcoming
their opposition." So much
for these people who, it is in-
ferred, are Republicans.
"The lunatic fringe among
the reactionaries" are casti-
gated because they say that
government programs would
make us a nation of "dead
beats and loafers." Of course
the President is against them.
Then there are "the gentle-
men who make these com-
plaints." The "complaints" are
not specified and the "gentle-
men" are not named. But your
President will take care of
them all right.
The Taft-Hartley Act was
created by people who "in-
sidiously" sought to "under-
mine the labor movement."
The labor movement, it may
be noted, was clearly in evi-
dence when the President
reached Chicago, and its power
was still sufficient to under-
mine the President's big show.
But however weak the labor
movement may become under
Taft-Hartley, the President will
strike off the shackles or put
his shoulders under the crum-
bling foundation or support the
tottering pillars or do what-
ever else is needed.

In Lincoln, certain horrible
people are mentioned, without
names, of course, who make
"fantastic estimates" of the cost
of the Brannan plan. These
are people "who don't under-
stand how it would work." It
is sufficient, apparently, for
Messrs. Truman and Brannan
merely to use contemptuous
epithets about this. For neither
of them has yet made any es-
timates on his own. Except-
and note this—the President
says it "should" not cost any
more and "may" cost less than
the present system. On the
basis of this "should-may" as-
surance, Congress is asked to
pass the plan.
And after all these names
have been called, including two
more for good measure—"self-
ish and shortsighted people"—
the President in the very
next sentence berates his op-
position for calling names.
The actors may be different
and the lines may be new, but
the plot of politics is immortal.
