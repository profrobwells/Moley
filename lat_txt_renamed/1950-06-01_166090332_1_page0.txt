Movie Pains of Britain
and U.S. Grow Worse
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For the greater part of 20
years the diplomatic relations
between Hollywood and the
British government have been
a source of continuous concern
on both sides of the Atlantic.
Not only the American
movie companies themselves,
but the producer's associations
—notably, under Will Hays
and later under Eric Johnston
—have labored ceaselessly to
effect agreements by which
American films could be
shown on British screens and
the profits therefrom brought
to Hollywood. Things were
complicated not only by British
reluctance to permit dollars
to leave their country, but
by a desperate British desire to
build up a film industry in
Britain.
*
A point of such severity was
reached that Hollywood decided
to embargo exports of
films to Britain. Finally, a
four-year agreement was made
in 1948, with quotas for both
British and American films to
be shown in Britain.
The real crux of the matter
was the intense interest of the
British people in American
pictures and the inability of
British producers to turn out
a sufficient number of good
pictures to make a dent in the
American market. American
exhibitors have no prejudice
against British films but, being
businessmen, they do not
like to show them to meager
audiences.
*
The quota fixed for British
films in Britain in the 1948
agreement was 45%. Almost
immediately, the British industry
found it impossible to
produce enough features to
meet this quota. Consequently,
the quota has been reduced
twice, and thus the gap in demand
for American features
has widened. Meanwhile, of
course, the British necessity to
check the outgo of dollars has
grown and grown.
Difficulties in the industry
In both countries have caused
unemployment—difficulties in
America, brought about by
television, among other things,
and in Britain brought about
by the inability to find material
for popular pictures.
Now both sides want a reconstruction
of the agreement,
after two trial years.
The purpose of the British
in making the agreement was
to keep the export of dollars
down to $17,000,000. In 1948
that meant £4,250,000. Now it
means more than £6,000,000.
The British want to reduce this
amount, Hollywood wants to
increase it.
Big ideas, once entertained,
by which American companies
were to make large numbers
of films in Britain have
proved overoptimistic. The
British do not want to import
too many American producers,
technicians and actors.
That would hurt British employment.
American labor unions in
the movie industry protest
against the making of American
pictures in Britain. That
would, they say, take bread
from their mouths and accentuate
the present depressed condition
of Hollywood business.
★
There are other complications.
The British film industry is
in real trouble in
many ways. There is further
complaint against what is
called a monopoly in distribution
in Britain by American
companies.
It may interest Americans
who are none too content about
American movies to know that
the British want them but can’t
get them. Over here they are
available to all, but demand is
slack and business is not good.
Apparently the Labor government,
despite its urge for
nationalization, has no desire
to take over this ailing industry.
Here is a problem that
neither the magic of British
Socialism nor the imagination
of Hollywood seems able to
solve.
