New Dealers' Whipping Boy
at Long Last Fights Back
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is increasing evidence
that the business worm is he-
ginning to turn. This time, the
battered but virile business-
man is moving with more skill
and power than in the Liberty
League days, 15 years ago.
After the great depression of
the early 1930s, businessmen
were shell-shocked, confused,
and imbued with the idea of
their unpopularity. Roosevelt
and other political leaders
found them a convenient and
highly serviceable "goat" for
all the woes of the country.
★
Whenever a real issue was
missing, F. D. R. merely turned
the heat on unnamed, "short-
sighted" or "reactionary small"
minorities of businessmen.
These gibes elicited the full-
throated hosannas of the multi-
tude. Labor leaders loved the
refrain, for it was of their own
origination.
Finally businessmen, be-
cause they hated publicity and
feared vindictive reprisals,
lapsed into silence, gave their
contributions to the Repub-
lican Party and toiled away at
producing goods in such mo-
ments as they could spare from
making out government re-
ports, defending themselves in
court, appearing before Con-
gressional committees and
wrangling with labor unions.
Successive defeats at the polls
in Presidential elections shook
their faith in political parties.
Republican Presidential candi-
dates with me-too programs
disheartened them still more.
Meanwhile a growing ele-
ment among them, and their
advertising and public rela-
tions advisers, urged business-
men to take their case directly
to the people. This idea has re-
cently begun to bear fruit.
They are hitting back, and hit-
ting with effectiveness. They
are apparently realizing that,
unless business takes the risk
of debating its case now, creep-
ing Socialism will leave no
business to fight for.
This is notably true of the
steel industry. During the
period of the President's fact-
finding board, several presi-
dents of steel companies
showed real capacity and great
courage in arguing their case.
They won a popular, if not a
governmental, decision, for
their logic and facts surpassed
those of Philip Murray and his
spokesmen.
★
More recently steel has had
to contend with the O'Mahoney
and Celler committees, and
there, too, they have been ef-
fective.
Benjamin Fairless recently
made a speech in Boston which
deserves high rank in eco-
nomic and political debate.
Charles White of Republic did
well in a New York speech.
Administration spokesmen will
come back fighting, but they
will find that the public is get-
ting tired of invective without
fact or logic.
Business leaders in other
fields such as insurance and oil
are laying the facts on the line
about the injury to everyone
by government spending and
inflation.
★
This new appeal should go
down into the rank and file of
business. Every salesman and
every other employee can
learn how to sell good doctrine
with his goods. In many com-
munities and Congressional
districts businessmen are join-
ing with doctors and other pro-
fessional men in mobilizing
citizen action to get rid of some
of the more obnoxious dema-
gogues in Congress. This is
the American way of political
action. A few more victories
like the defeat of Pepper will
make the advocates of the
superstate stop, look and
listen.
