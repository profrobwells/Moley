Murray Shields, an able and
Imaginative economist, points
out a method by which Federal
taxes can be reduced and the
budget balanced, too. And his
plan makes a lot of sense.
He begins with what could
be saved by the adoption of
the salient recommendations of
the Hoover report. His esti-
mate is conservative-some
hundreds of millions, rather
than billions. He suggests, fur-
ther, a halt in the many new
spending programs of the Fair
Deal. These economies are,
however, only a prelude to his
major points, which he ex-
plains in this way:
"There are in addition three
major areas in which it should
be possible to make substan-
tial reductions in revenue re-
quirements in the next few
years:
"1-By allowing budgeted
outlays in the foreign aid and
the veterans' education pro-
grams to run off according to
original schedules, total ex-
penditures would be gradually
reduced to a point $6,000,000,-
000 to $7,000,000,000 per annum
less than at present.
"2-A drain on the U. S.
Treasury of about $2,000,000,-
000 to $3,000,000,000 a year
could be avoided by re-
stricting the outlays of Fed-
eral loan agencies to more
conservative limits and requir-
ing them to raise such funds
as are necessary to their oper-
ations by sale of their own
obligations-guaranteed by the
Federal government-in the
open market.
"3-Substantial charges to
the Federal budget could be
eliminated by deferring public
works projects until periods of
slack private business, by plac-
ing more of them (when under-
taken) on a revenue produc-
ing basis and by having these
managed and financed by
agencies which would raise the
necessary funds through sale
of their securities to the pub-
lic instead of by drafts on the
U. S. Treasury. The result
would be a reduction of from
$3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000
in annual revenue require-
ments."
This proposal in the main
merely suggests that the Fed-
eral government finance proj-
ects in the manner tradition-
ally followed by States, cities,
and such agencies as the New
York Port Authority.
If great Federal projects
such as hydroelectric dams
are, as their proponents claim,
ultimately self-liquidating,
they are good investments for
the public, provided the gov-
ernment makes good its claim
with a guarantee. If they are
not good investments, it is time
to tear off the mask.
Beyond the immense bene-
fits bestowed by ending infla-
tionary deficits and reducing
taxes, there is another advan-
tage in this plan. It would dis-
tribute ownership broadly and
thus reverse the trend toward
that point of no return where
most of our national wealth
will be owned by the Federal
government.
