THE FUZZY
COURT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Tidelands Decisions
Hasty scanning of the Supreme Court's decisions last
week against Louisiana and
Texas has given the wide impression that the United
States has acquired ownership
of something that the States
owned before.
The decisions, as is usual,
are so beclouded with legal
terminology that the layman
can hardly draw anything but
the impression that this is a
famous victory for the Federal
government. Moreover, the
decision of the majority is so
craftily written by Justice
Douglas that this erroneous
impression is almost inescapable.
If we reduce the issue to
common sense terms, however,
some light may be thrown upon
the decisions.
This controversy goes back
to a suit brought by the United
States against California,
decided in 1947. It was claimed
that the United States, not
California, owns the land under
water extending three
miles from the coast. California
held that it owned the
land.
★
California maintained that,
since all unclaimed land belonged
to each of the 13 States
when the Union was formed,
California also owns such
land within its borders and
out to the three-mile limit.
In a long decision, Justice
Black so artfully wove his
words together that, while the
title of ownership by California
was beclouded, a title in
the United States was not established. What was decided
was that the United States has
"paramount rights." This
blurs the whole issue.
The real issue is the difference
between what in law is
called dominium and what is
called imperium. Dominium is
"ownership or right of property." Imperium is "the right
of the state to enforce the
laws."
No one denied the right of
imperium to the United States.
The right of dominium was
and still is completely up in
the air.
★
The United States has rights
pertaining to any government.
For example, it can regulate
interstate commerce within
States and over private property. It can condemn land for
military purposes, and it can
move ships and troops over
land and water. But this does
not give it ownership, unless
it pays for it. It protects the
coast, but it does not thereby
exact a royalty from shipping.
In short, the United States
may and must use its Army
to protect my henhouse from
a foreign invader. But it does
not thereby own my hens, nor
can it claim every third egg.
★
But in the California, Texas
and Louisiana cases, that is
exactly what the Federal government is trying to do. For
it never bothered about the
land under the sea until its
cupidity was aroused by the
discovery of oil there, from
which the States concerned
drew royalties from companies
to which they gave permission
to sink wells.
The California decision was
opposed by very intelligent
dissents from Justices Reed
and Frankfurter. Justice Reed
seems to have made a conclusive case that ownership
or dominium really is vested
in California. Justice Frankfurter denies a proprietary or
ownership interest by the
United States in the submerged lands. And since the
decision means only "paramount" rights, the issue of
ownership is left in the air.
★
In the Louisiana case last
week, the California decision
was followed by Justices Douglas, Black, Burton and Vinson.
Justices Reed, Frankfurter and
Minton dissented.
In the Texas case, a still
greater right in the State was
established because Texas
came into the Union under a
treaty which respected its
rights to the tidelands. But
this was brushed aside by the
majority.
The issue now goes to Congress. If a majority of Congress, in which Representatives from inland States can
if they will override the
States which own these lands,
Congress can declare these
lands a part of the national domain. To do so would be a
clear case of the tyranny of
have-nots over haves. The
power is there, but the morality of such action would be
very bad indeed.
