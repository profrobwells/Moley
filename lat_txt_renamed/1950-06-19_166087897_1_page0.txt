Nature Adds Her Veto
to the Brannan Plan
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems now that not only
Congress and Iowa, but Old
Mother Nature has decided
against the Brannan plan.
Without the Brannan bid for
farm votes, the President may
have hard going in the farm
States. Ironically enough, the
prosperity for which the
President claims credit had a
lot to do with the changed
situation.
Once more, the idea of over-
all economic planning proves
to be a delusion, because as
soon as government fixes up
one part of the economy, an-
other gets out of control.
It now appears that, while
crop support in the crop years
1948 and 1949 required a gov-
ernment outlay of $2,000,-
000,000 each, the amount re-
quired for 1950 will be only
about one-fourth of that
amount, or between $500,-
000,000 and $400,000,000. This
will be less than the $600,-
000,000 annual outlay in the
Wallace regime of the 30s.
A smaller wheat crop will
not need more than $100,-
000,000. There will be no corn
surplus. Instead, increased
cattle herds will draw on the
accumulated stocks of the
Commodity Credit Corp. Thus,
the government will get back
some sorely needed cash—
between $250,000,000 and $400,-
000,000.
The main expenditures will
be about $120,000,000 for sub-
sidies under the international
wheat agreement and $130,-
000,000 for dairy products,
especially butter. About $100,-
000,000 will be needed for cot-
ton—perhaps much less.
A number of new factors
have brought about this re-
duced outlay requirement. The
wheat crop will be smaller, but
still sufficient. There will be
a smaller corn and cotton
acreage. But most important,
there has been an increased
consumption of meat products.
Everyone expected that pork
would have to be supported.
That support was not needed.
Beef is holding well above sup-
port price. Thus, there will be
an expansion of livestock hold-
ings and more grain will go
for feed.
Under these circumstances,
it will be very hard to make a
case this year for the rigid
Socialistic controls of the Bran-
nan plan. Presumably, it will
also be hard next year. The
great Brannan bogey of a huge
surplus has been dissipated, at
least for 18 months. If the
whole Brannan show is to be
revived in 1952, nature will
have to appear as a star actor.
This situation buys precious
time for Republicans looking
toward 1952. They have no real
program now, but they may be
able, owing to this new devel-
opment, to put together a pro-
gram, if they can reconcile
their differences and use a
measurable amount of inven-
tive wr.
The change in the crop situ-
ation was not lost on the
voters of Iowa. For farmers
are a canny lot and, unless
they are threatened by a sur-
plus, they are not friendly to
regimentation. Contrary to
traditional opinion, farmers
are not likely to peer very far
into the future. They live for
this year and the next. And
there is not much they can ask
from the government for a
while.
The administration’s Bran-
nan candidate, Loveland in
Iowa, gathered only a small
minority of votes and faces
rough treatment in the Novem-
ber election.
Congress, too, is catching on.
A revolt has been taking place
in the committees of both
houses. Harold D. Cooley, in
the House and Elmer Thomas
in the Senate, both facing an
election, have abandoned the
Brannan idea of subsidizing
perishables. And there is even
rising opposition to flexible
supports.
Political and economic plans
must now take account of this
new look in crops.
