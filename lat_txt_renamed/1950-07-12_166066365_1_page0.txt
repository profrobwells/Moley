It is a habit of bureaucrats
when an emergency arises to
think of controlling everybody
and everything but themselves
and their own operations.
It can be taken for granted,
if a general war with Russia
should come, that the private
economy of this country would
be put under the most complete
and elaborate controls that can
be imagined â€” much more so
than in previous wars. The
files of the various authorities
in Washington are full of such
plans.
*
It is also widely assumed
that if this Korean war continues
or if other similar affairs should
break out in various places, the
passion of bureaucrats would
push lesser controls as far as
possible. In short, we are told
that a 5% hot war will give us
a 15 or 20% controlled economy.
It is already clear that there
soon will be an approach to
controls. The first that will be
likely to come will be called
"voluntary" priorities. Then
there probably will be "voluntary"
price controls. It will be
remembered that Leon Henderson
began with "voluntary" price
limitations long before Pearl
Harbor.
*
It is likely that if these small
wars indicate a prospect of
continuing, it will be decreed
by the government that "voluntary"
priorities and controls are not
working and compulsory
measures will be sought.
It also is likely that a restoration
of Regulation W, which was a
limitation on loans for consumer
goods, will be sought. But a
careful examination of the
operation of Regulation W in the
last war indicates that it was not
so effective as was supposed by
the government. The very threat
of its being put into use would
cause a rush for goods to be
paid for through various sorts of
personal loans and would do more
harm than the regulation could
later cure.
Before any of these controls are
undertaken, it might be well to
consider their general wisdom.
*
An over-all freeze of prices and
wages would be likely to slow
down and frustrate production.
The infinitely complex relationship
of prices and costs that prevails
in a free market when frozen by an
over-all government order loses
its capacity to adjust itself to a
war economy and the whole flow
of the economy falters. The
justification for freezing is the
prevention of profiteering. But at
the onset of war there is a worse
danger than profiteering. That is
the impairment of the capacity to
produce.
If government should turn to a
few controls over itself the
transition might be made with
more ease. In the first place, no
general rise of prices for war and
for peacetime goods can take
place if the volume of money
remains constant.
At first, prices of war goods would
rise and the prices of peace goods
would decline. Later, the producers
of peace goods would be attracted
to war goods and supplies of war
essentials would rise. Moreover,
the rise of prices in war goods
would mean higher wages and the
necessary manpower would move
without compulsion into war
production.
*
Inflation could be partially
checked in a natural manner if
government would put some
controls on its own spending for
things not essential to war. Great
public works, the completion of
which is far in the future, should
be stopped. The urge to provide
many of the benefits of a welfare
state might be checked, with a
definitely wholesome effect on
total spending.
If civilians are to be told to
dispense with things in the
emergency, government should
deny itself some political luxuries.
Shortages of labor already are
appearing in certain places. The
mobility of labor is not what it
should be. This is sharpened by
the industrial pensions.
If there are to be controls let
the government show the way by
self-control.
