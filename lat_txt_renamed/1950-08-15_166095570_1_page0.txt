They Run
Without
Reason
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
These are truly amazing
times, when nothing is what it
seems to be and great decisions
are made on wholly irrational
grounds.
The nation is desperately
fighting to maintain a small
spot in Asia which a few
months ago was considered
worthless. Our explanation for
our present concern in Korea
is to make it unnecessary to
fight somewhere else.
At the same time at home irrational
people are rushing to
buy things for which they
have no present and probably
no ultimate need.

But strangest of all is the
spectacle of the two political
parties in Washington moving
toward the imposition of
controls which both declared
to be unnecessary and which
both still believe to be worse
than useless.
And it is still more strange
that this conversion is due to
the influence of the suggestion
of one man, Bernard Baruch,
who holds no office and is never
likely to hold one.
The explanation for this behavior
is that there is an election
ahead of us and if either
party holds out against the
controls, the other will blame
it for, whatever happens. And
anything that happens is likely
to be irritating and uncomfortable.
A sober look at the economic
facts makes it pretty clear
that real prices will go up in
any event, with or without
controls, that there will be stupid
and cumbersome red tape,
that labor will raise a rumpus
about wages or something in
lieu thereof, that nobody will
be happy, and everybody will
be looking for somebody to
vote against.

In 1941 and early 1942 there
was the same demand for
over-all controls that we now
hear. Political expediency prevented
their adoption at first,
and then, with an election coming
on, political expediency in
October again brought about a
partial adoption of a Baruch
plan.
Expediency will probably
dictate the course once more.
Since the specific instructions
of the Democratic high command
are to attack the Republicans
for delaying the war effort, the
minority in Congress
will be likely to give the President
the stand-by powers that
he now asks.
Then the President, by way
of a gesture, will do something
that looks like the Baruch
plan.
But many exceptions will be
made for political expediency.
Farm products probably
will be excluded because they
have not yet reached parity
prices. Labor will be appeased
because it is already
claimed that price rises have
wiped out recent wage gains.
The whole thing cannot get
under way for some time because
the administrative machinery
is not ready.
★
Meanwhile, the public, because
of all this scare talk on
all sides, will have forced up
prices.
Voluntary agreements all
around would have prevented
much of this confusion. But
the time for that has been
slipping away for more than a
month. Nothing seems to be
ahead now except the long,
tortuous course that began in
1941 and continued until the
end of the war.
Expedient will follow expedient,
with never a real effort
to grapple with the unpleasant
facts.
