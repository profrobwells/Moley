BUSINESS
AS GOAT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the face of mounting criticism of its foreign and military
policy, the Truman administration, directly or through
labor allies, is mounting a
counteroffensive. Certain segments of the business community seem to be the first
objectives.
The President and Secretary
Brannan have dragged out the
old spook of commodity speculation. This one appears every
time the inflation of food prices
becomes embarrassing. Its
last appearance was two or
three years ago. A half century ago, it was the subject of
invective by William Jennings
Bryan.

Nothing drastic ever happens, and speculation never
ceases.
Processors and others who
must plan months ahead and
be assured of supplies of raw
materials to meet their fixed
obligations in price and quantity must depend upon those
who trade in and out of the
market. Those traders take
the risks and make their living
thereby.
If they are smart, they make
a good living, just as do smart
people in other lines of human
activity. And as it is in other
lines of competitive business,
there are losses as well as
gains.
The administration's friends
in the labor movement, no
doubt with the full knowledge
and assent of the government,
have brought out another
spook. This is the allegation
that the steel industry is in
business for the purpose of
making less rather than more
steel. For more than a year,
the Celler committee has been
rattling the old bones. The
new attack is from Walter
Reuther of the United Automobile Workers.

On July 20 Reuther addressed a letter to the heads
of all the automobile companies. In this he began with
the plea that in the present
emergency labor and management should discuss together
the possible allocation of steel
to the automobile industry.
This would seem reasonable
enough, of course. The letter,
however, went on to state the
old charge against the steel
industry that there was deliberate restriction of production
and that something should be
done about it. The Reuther
idea of doing something, of
course, would be to put the
government into the steel
business.
Most automobile managers
proved to be too familiar with
the Reuther methods to engage
in any Socialistic collaboration
of that sort. The Chrysler
Corp. replied that, while they
would be glad to have a discussion of common problems,
they did not consider that the
encouragement of the government to take over the steel
industry was any business of
either the automobile industry
or of Reuther's union.
