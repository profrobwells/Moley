The New Foreign Policy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Top military leaders, upon
whose shoulders the great burden
will fall, have been informed
of a new Korean policy by the
high administration command.
This policy apparently emanates
from the State Department. It
seems that the department, which
washed its hands for a long time
of any real concern with the
Asiatic mainland and later under
Presidential pressure reversed
itself, would now go all the way.
★
The policy, already cautiously
presented by U.N. Delegate
Warren Austin, is to scrap the
plan to move back only to the
38th parallel. Instead, it is
proposed to conquer all of Korea.
Then, with a firm grip on the
whole nation, there will be set
up a fine new democratic
republic. Of course, this will be
implemented with all the so-called
gadgets of so-called democracy
that the zealots from the State
Department can contrive. Maybe
these will include free elections;
direct primaries, with cross filing
like that of California; civil service
and a Hatch Act; a party system
set up by Chairman Boyle of
Kansas City; and also a radio
Voice of Korea at our expense.
★
There would also be a crew of
economic experts such as those
who dismantled German and
Japanese industry under the guise
of destroying trusts and cartels.
Possibly the Morgenthau plan
will at last have its innings. Of
course, such a process of
"democratization" will involve
the fostering of labor unions and
co-operatives similar to those
fostered by our people in Japan.
And Mrs. Roosevelt will be ready
to provide the emancipated nation
with a nice declaration of human
rights, with an FEPC and social
security.
Once more, we shall move on
the proposition that all peoples
are ready and waiting for our
own special notions of democracy
and that it is our divinely ordained
mission to install them.
The military leaders have been
told that this conquest may take
a long time, which of course they
already know, but that it is
indispensable to our prestige and
to the broad interests of making
Asia safe for democracy.
Presumably, we hope to get the
United Nations to approve this
change of plan, despite the
present clear U.N. commitment
to go back only to the 38th
parallel. But since in the new
plan, as is now the case, the
conquest will be at our own
expense, the so-called allies will
be agreeable. The plan would
more than double the job which
already looks like a most
formidable military operation.
And at its conclusion and before
the reformers arrive, our forces
will be confronting Red China in
Manchuria and, within 50 miles,
Soviet Russia.
