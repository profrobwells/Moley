Foreign Policy Is the Issue
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Many Congressmen said, as
they left Washington for a
visit home over Labor Day,
that they will know a lot more
about political prospects after
their return to Washington in
mid-September or sooner.
Events of immense political
significance have been following
each other with such rapidity
that even the most
hardened politicians seem to
be dazed and incapable of
clear judgment, not only about
what should be the line of argument
in the political campaign, but
about what the result may be.
One reason for this confusion
is a fact well known to
seasoned political observers.
That is that there is a time
lag in the development of public
sentiment over the great
reaches of this country. An
issue which may keenly affect
the people of California at
this time may be quite unlike
one currently concerning people
in New York.
One reporter who visited
Wisconsin two weeks ago
says that people there are
now greatly concerned about
Acheson's defense of Hiss and
the failure of the Tydings
committee to meet the issue
of McCarthy's charges.
I found, on the other hand,
in California two weeks ago
that Hiss had been forgotten
and that sentiment was rising
against Acheson for his mistaken
views on Formosa.
Since then, the MacArthur
of feeling, it is impossible to
find any clear trend. But it
is becoming more and more
probable that by mid-October,
unless a miracle happens in
Korea or at the United Nations,
the country generally
will be deeply disturbed about
the future and deeply doubtful
about the capacity of the
Truman administration.
Slowly the tragic sequence
of policy mistakes by the
Roosevelt and Truman
regimes is dawning upon the
average man. Parents who see
their children called to the
Colors twice in 10 years will
ask why that should be necessary.
They will know, and will no
doubt be doubly reminded by
Republican speakers, about the
unnecessary lengthening of the
late war by unconditional surrender
and the Morgenthau
plan.
They will recall Cairo and
the promise to return Formosa
to China before it was
known what sort of China
there would be.
They will recall Yalta and
Potsdam and the destruction
of German and Japanese industry.
Other steps in the long road
will be remembered.
When the public reaches
that state of mind, it votes
against, not for, something.
That was true in 1932. It can
happen again.
