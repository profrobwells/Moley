RISKLESS
LIVING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Apparently, it all started
with Joseph in Egypt. In his
position as the chief econ-
omy adviser to the Pharaoh,
he devised a scheme to store
grain in fat years and use it
in lean years and thus con-
quer the economic cycle.
"Huey Long talked about the
idea and called it the "drop-a-
crop" plan. Henry Wallace
took it up and somebody,
maybe Henry, called it the
"ever-normal granary."
All our farm legislation has
aimed at leveling out the farm-
er's economic hills and val-
leys. It may be added that to
do so provides some other
citizens several hills and val-
leys thereby.

Everywhere, people are
seeking means to make life
livable by taking away all
risk. But somehow their meth-
ods merely shift the risk to
someone else.
A little more than two years
ago, General Motors and the
United Auto Workers thought
up the ever-normal wage. This
was to be or is an automatic
device to raise and lower
wages in line with the varia-
tion of the cost-of-living in-
dex. Since the beginning of
that plan, we have most of
the time had inflation, and
thus wages have generally
gone up. It will take a long
time to determine how well
the UAW will like it when
wages have to go down.
Although Chrysler and Ford
would have none of such stuff,
Packard has undertaken it.
Washington, always fasci-
nated by schemes to eliminate
worry, is studying the plan in
anticipation of general appli-
cation when complete con-
trols give President Truman's
merry men power to run
everything.

Recently, we have had the
suggestion of the ever-normal
government bond. Prof. Sum-
ner Slichter suggested it, and
this column gave some atten-
tion to the idea. The plan
would be to sell bonds, the
value of which would vary ac-
cording to the cost of living.
It would, in effect, be insur-
ance against the decline in
the real value of a bond
through inflation.
My column suggested that
the idea had been tried in Ger-
many at the peak of the
great inflation of the 20s. The
Weimar Republic issued
bonds on which repayment
was to be made at a rate of
a certain number of marks
per dollar or a certain weight
of rye. Some people called
them "rye bonds."
Since that column appeared
three weeks ago, one of my
critics wrote a letter to the
Los Angeles Times, in which
the column had appeared, ex-
panding the idea. The difficul-
ty with his letter was that
he thought I had meant rye
whisky, not grain. His mis-
conception, however, has a
good deal of merit.
★
Perhaps if people who
bought bonds and then found
inflation whittling down their
purchasing power in dollars,
were paid off in rye whisky,
they might accept this means
of letting the whole matter
drop. Such repayment, proper-
ly used, would induce them
to forget inflation, the wel-
fare state, the State Depart-
ment, and, in fact, the entire
Truman administration.
It is to be hoped that my
critic will expand his con-
cept and thus add to the busi-
ness of statesmanship.
Incidentally, the whole con-
cept, of the "commodity" or
"flexible" or "rubber" dollar
seems to have come from Ger-
many, where the late Irving
Fisher, our own most inde-
fatigable propagandist, and
the late John Maynard
Keynes picked it up.
★
The quest will no doubt pro-
ceed. The notion rivals that
of the alchemists of old.
Those ancient researchers
found no way to transmute
base metal into gold, but mod-
ern economists still seek a
substitute.
Meanwhile, there are those
people who made investments
in insurance, in bonds and in
Social Security equities—mil-
lions and millions—for whom
no normalcy can be promised.
They will, in fact, be the
people who will pay for the
normalcy of the favored few.
Ultimately, perhaps, we shall
have a great political move-
ment which might be called
"share-the-normalcy" or
"share-the-risks." That is
something that might sweep
the country.
