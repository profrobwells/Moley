The Danger
of Too Much
Confidence
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
With a most important mid-
term election only a little
more than seven weeks ahead,
the interest of voters in poli-
tics is at a very low ebb.
James A. Farley left last
week for his customary pre-
election tour to a series of
foreign countries. There are
those who assert that this
habit of Jim's has been in-
spired by a quite understand-
able reluctance to make
speeches for Democratic can-
didates whom he believes in
his discriminating conscience
to be unfit for the jobs for
which they aspire. But that
may be a quite unfair esti-
mate of his stalwart loyalty
to his party and also to his
business obligations, which
have to do with every coun-
try where his product is
known.
*
In any event, Farley's lack
of interest in Democratic can-
didates is no evidence of any
lack of shrewd political judg-
ment, and he said before he
left that he could not recall a
year when there was so lit-
tle public interest in a forth-
coming election. This judg-
ment has support among
many other shrewd observers.
Of course, it is no news
that those people who have
most to lose by the triumph
of machine-managed victo-
ries in behalf of extravagant
and incompetent people are
most lethargic in their civic
duties.

In a recent issue of Busi-
ness Week there appeared the
account of a survey conducted
by Edward A. Sampson of
the Colorado Trade Execu-
tives Institute, on the current
political activities of 2314 busi-
nessmen. The results showed
that more than one-third of
these men failed to register
and could not vote.
Of those who did register,
40% had no party affiliation
and therefore could have no
part in the selection of candi-
dates. In a comment on this
dismal display, Sampson
pointed out that in Denver
80% of organized labor reg-
istered and voted.
Thus, the very people who
have the most to lose by pres-
ent trends in politics are do-
ing very little to improve the
situation.

The news from Ohio this
week is that the prospects for
the re-election of Taft, which
were very bright two or three
months ago, are not so good
now. There have been mis-
takes made by Taft backers,
and organized labor has been
incredibly busy. Taft himself
has been exceedingly active
and has gained with the rank
and file of workers. But he
cannot win if those who
should support him lag in
their efforts.
Meanwhile, the President
goes his supremely confident
way. And we already know
the recklessness of his deci-
sions when he is in that mood.
The only thing that may in-
still a further measure of calm
thought in the Truman psy-
chology and a real effort to
follow good advice would be a
sharp defeat in November.
But that measure of relief
will not come unless respon-
sible people rouse themselves
and not only vote but get
others to vote.
