WE CAN BE
SAVED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The threat of inflation to
our property and stability is
vastly greater than that of the
atomic bomb to our lives.
Even the most direful proph-
ets suggest that no more than
a small percentage of us might
be killed by the bomb. But in-
flation is a threat to all prop-
erty, all values, all stability.
And in a defensive action we
must, as in the case of civilian
defense against the bomb,
help save ourselves. For no
action, even by a tremendous-
ly efficient government, can
provide complete defense. This
government, it will be conced-
ed, is not tremendously effi-
cient.

In the first place, let us avoid
panic. Although dangers exist
which I described in yester-
day's column, we have not yet
reached a genuine flight from
the dollar. If everyone seeks
to save himself, we shall all
likewise perish.

There are several favorable
factors in our present situa-
tion, which automatically pro-
vide defenses:

1—The present Federal
budget is immense and grow-
ing. It cannot be balanced by
taxation. But the margin by
which authorized expendi-
tures exceed income from tax-
ation, which in the main has
been added since the begin-
ning of the Korean war, rep-
resents government purchase
of goods and services which
will not be delivered or paid
for until well along in 1951.
Thus, the impact of new in-
flationary money will not hit
us for many months or a
year.

2—There is some but not a
great deal of expansion of
bank credit. Restrictions on
installment buying will help
further. Moreover, the bank-
ers of America, notably those
in agricultural regions, are
turning a glassy stare on the
farmers who want credit to
buy more land. They have
learned by bitter experience
that farmers are likely to go
overboard in a boom. Bank-
ers once more will persuade
their clients to put their
money into bonds.

3—A basic habit of saving
in the American people—
which, despite much muddling
by government early in the
second World War, helped to
ward off inflation—can be
counted upon to manifest itself
again. Bonds can be sold in
quantity, despite the dangers
which threaten their real
value at maturity.

4—Despite the defects inher-
ent in the present controls law
and the ineptitude and con-
fusion that seem to attend the
effort to use it, there will be
considerable anti-inflationary
power in its application.

5—We may once more see
the American industrial plant
perform a new production mir-
acle. That, with the funda-
mental American habit of sav-
ing, warded off the danger be-
fore.

In face of the dangers
ahead, these factors are reas-
suring. But they cannot pre-
vail unless Congress and the
President are prepared for
quick action once the election
is over. There still remain
powerful measures, if it be-
comes evident that voluntary
efforts are not at work. There
can be forced savings through
legal means. Increases in
wages or other forms of in-
come can be paid in bonds not
callable until the threat of in-
flation has passed.

A wise elder statesman,
whose name is closely associ-
ated with controls now and in
the late war, has suggested—
not for the record, it is true—
that the best remedy for the
citizen lies in the coming elec-
tion. The voter who realizes
the dangers of inflation can
help to throw out of office
spendthrift Congressmen and
Senators. That is perhaps the
best immediate safeguard for
everyone.
