Shortage of Man Power
Is Beginning to Be Felt
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This little war will have big
consequences. Whatever may
be the direct outcome of the
Korean affair, its effect upon
our domestic economy will con-
tinue to be important in all
calculations. It is not too much
to say that the Communist
invasion of June may well be a
significant turning point in our
economic history.
Prices move up and up,
with no stabilization in sight.
The general pattern of a fifth
round of wage increases is
forming. This time, the aver-
age demand will be an increase
of about 10%. That will mean
an increase of approximately
5% in the nation's produc-
tion costs.

There is a bomb-inspired
flight from cities into country
property, especially in the
Northeast.
The general impact on the
supply of man power is very
serious.
With almost full employ-
ment in 1949, the United States
produced a volume of $256,000,-
000,000 in 1949 dollars. There
were 59,000,000 employed and
3,400,000 unemployed, of which
number about half were unem-
ployable.
In the first half of this year,
before Korea, employment rose
to more than 60,000,000. Since
then there has been a rapid
rise to 62,500,000 civilians em-
ployed, and the gross national
product is at a rate of $275,000,-
000,000 a year.
*
Shortages of industrial work-
ers are appearing everywhere.
The demand is reported by the
Labor Department at a five-
year peak.
If the Korean war ends with-
out further outbreaks else-
where, these consequences will
continue to mount up.
We have determined to in-
crease our armed forces by
about 2,000,000 men, and our
expenditure for national de-
fense by $15,000,000,000 or
$20,000,000,000.
Making the stuff for which
this expenditure is planned
will take 4,000,000 more work-
ers. The result will be that
after every employable work-
er is taken—and that has al-
most happened now—there
will still be a demand for more
than 6,000,000 workers. Where
can they be found?
This is where the women
will come in—four or more
million strong. Then a million
or two hitherto "overaged"
men and "underaged" boys.
Beyond that, there may well
be required countless hours of
overtime.
*
All this is essential if we are
not going to reduce sharply
our production of civilian
goods. And it would seem that
the necessary man power can
be found.
Presumably, unless a general
war breaks out or a revolution
takes place in Russia, the cold
war made into a dry ice war
by Korea will go on for an un-
predictable time.
In the course of that time,
certain correctives will oper-
ate. There will be the natural
increase in production per
man-hour, which is generally
estimated at 3% a year. New
machinery and more efficient
organization accounts for that.
Also, there will be a natural
growth of the labor force by
about 1,000,000 a year.
*
The big strain, therefore,
will end in about two years.
If a third world war comes,
an entirely new set of circum-
stances will be present. These
will entail a process of regi-
mentation, freezing of workers
and austerity beyond anything
ever before experienced, un-
less such a war should be
brief and decisive. That even-
tuality need not be anticipated
now.
There is enough to worry
about in the inflation and re-
adjustment of employment
that lie immediately ahead.
