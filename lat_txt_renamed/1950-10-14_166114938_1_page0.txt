They Have the Most
to Lose, but Don't Vote
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the CIO-AFL campaign
against Taft, the issue will be
decided by the extent to which
voters who believe in Taft's
principles get out and vote.
In past campaigns these
people have not been voting.
And if, as a result of this
election, their savings, their
businesses and professions
are further endangered by a
drift to Socialism, they will
have nobody but themselves to
blame.

Proof of this is shown in
figures compiled by the Ohio
Republican State headquar-
ters. In a great industrial
plant in Ohio, where the Labor
League will probably bring
90% of its member voters to
the polls, 35% of the white col-
lar voters were found to have
neglected to register. This is
probably true in hundreds of
other plants, although there
has been a big increase in
registration everywhere.
In 1948 the record of voting
of these groups, which would
normally be Republican, was
disgraceful. They think and
talk Republican, but on elec-
tion day they are missing.
A test of bank employees
shows that in 1918 26.7% failed
to register, and of those who
did register, a great many
failed to vote.
*
Ministers of the gospel, who
might be expected to show a
decent example of responsible
citizenship, did worse. One-
third of them did not vote.
And of their faithful wives,
38% failed to vote.
Automobile dealers, who are
of the very essence of the free
enterprise system so seriously
threatened by the Fair Deal,
helped Truman by staying
away in droves. One-third of
them failed to vote, and 40%
of their wives did not vote.
Chamber of Commerce
members, 21.8% strong, who
probably regularly attended
meetings at which Truman
was denounced as a destroyer
of business, failed to do any-
thing about it on election day.
One out of five country
club members found golf and
highballs more alluring than
the support of their principles
on voting day.
â˜…
Incidentally, the best vot-
ing record of all those com-
piled was that of Kiwanis and
Rotary Club members. They
'turned out 90% strong. This
means that civic spirit is
something more than a name
and that it can be developed.
But the wives in all these
groups failed to justify them-
selves.
The State Republican Com-
mittee made a very careful
study of voting in the 5th
Ohio District and learned
some distressing things. The
5th District is the northwest-
ern corner of Ohio. It has no
large cities. It is rural and
small town territory, tradi-
tionally Republican. Between
1940 and 1948 its population
increased 4800. But its vote
for President declined 14,600.
*
The chief offenders were
Republicans by a heavy mar-
gin.
These people who are shirk-
ing their responsibilities are
precisely the people who
have most to lose by the
growth of the superstate, by
heavy taxation, by govern-
ment handouts and by creep-
ing Socialism.
Again and again, it is shown
that Fair Deal candidates who
continue in their support of
the Truman machine and the
labor bosses get into office
with somewhere between 20
and 30% of eligible votes.
There were undoubtedly ma-
jorities for Willkie and Dewey
in three elections, but they
did not vote.
It remains to be seen wheth-
er these lazy citizens will per-
mit Taft to lose this election.
