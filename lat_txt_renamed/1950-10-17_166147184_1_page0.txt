ON PAYING
THE PIPER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Next year, the Treasury of
the United States must begin
one of the most difficult tasks
in its history. Facing, as it
will, more deficits and more
borrowing, it must still find
the means of redeeming the
many billions held by investors in its famous E Bonds.
Figures in round numbers,
brought up to date within the
last three months, show that
in present value, not redemption value, the amount
outstanding is $34,542,000,000.
These mature during the next
few years as follows: in 1951,
$1,100,000,000; in 1952, $3,000,000,000; in 1953, $5,400,000,000;
in 1954, $6,000,000,000; in 1955,
$4,800,000,000.

The problem now before the
Treasury is how to pay, avoid
or postpone payment of the
amounts due each year.
Clearly, with a vast deficit
in prospect, it cannot collect
in taxes any part of the cash
necessary for redemption.
Three possibilities present
themselves to the Treasury in
meeting the demand of a man
who bought a $1000 bond 10
years ago for $750.
First, it can pay him the
$1000 and then sell him or
somebody else a bond for
$1000.
This will involve a selling
effort at an exceedingly high
cost. For it costs money to sell
bonds, just as it costs money
to sell soap, candy or cigarettes. And it is possible that
when all costs are considered,
the expenses involved in selling
a bond exceed those of
most commercial articles.
*
There are many estimates of
how much it cost the Treasury
to sell bonds in the last
10 years. A conservative guess
is that it cost close to a quarter of a billion dollars. To that
should be added all the services, talent and advertising
space given free. That would
probably run as high as the
direct cost to the government.
Also, there was loss to the
Treasury in many of the free
contributions, for such services could be charged off in
income taxes in many cases.
Moreover, the cost of selling
a bond will be much higher in
a period of half war, half peace
such as we are facing. There
will be more sales resistance,
not only because the impact of
total war will be missing, but
because the prospective buyers, having already felt the
bite of inflation, will hesitate
to take the risk again.
A second way of meeting
the maturity of E Bonds
would be to offer a new bond
in exchange for the old one—
the new one with a maturity
period of perhaps 12 or 13
years.
★
In considering such an offer
it should be remembered that
the old E Bonds accumulated
interest at a progressive rate.
Interest began at nothing and
mounts to the highest rate in
the year of maturity. To offer
a similar bond in exchange for
the old one would be to ask
purchasers to give up a bond
paying approximately 3% on
maturity for one paying nothing for the first year. This
would take a lot of explaining
and sales effort, again at a
great cost.
A third plan has been recommended to the Treasury by
experienced bankers and is
now under consideration. This
plan would be to give holders
of E Bonds the option of cashing them or of keeping them.
*
If they keep them, the government would pay 3% flat on
them for an indefinite period.
Thus, the holder of an E Bond
for $1000 would receive $15
every six months as long as
he chose to keep the bond.
Bankers believe that a large
majority of holders would
choose to keep the bonds and
draw this very fair rate of interest. It is also urged that,
since the Treasury would save
a lot of money in selling new
bonds, it could well be generous with those people who
bought E Bonds and held them
for 10 years.
*
This does nothing to help
the situation imposed by inflation and the declining value of
the dollar. That problem must
be met some other way. But
this third plan would eliminate part of the expense and
trouble of a new sales campaign and keep a good deal of
money out of circulation.
