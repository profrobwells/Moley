Helen and Marcantonio
Making Similar Appeal
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There could scarcely be a
greater contrast than that be-
tween the magnificent State of
California and a segment of
the city of New York that runs
along the western side of the
East and Harlem Rivers from
59th to 119th Sts. and encloses
a variegated population of
more than 300,000. But the is-
sues which agitate Vito Marc-
antonio's 18th District and the
State of California are almost
identical.
Marcantonio has been in
Congress for seven terms. His
service began in the early New
Deal days and has run through
the preliminaries to the war,
the war itself, and the after-
math.
*
His line has been consistent-
ly sympathetic with aims and
diversions of Soviet Russia.
He would deny that he is a
Communist, although he has
Communist support. But by
a demagogic appeal to class
hatreds, he sways a large, be-
nighted array of voters whose
origins lie in almost every cor-
ner of the world.
He helped create the so-
called American Labor Party,
into which drifted thousands
of soft-minded people who
called themselves liberals. And
like all such people who yearn
for a new world, they came to
a rude awakening when they
discovered that Communists
were running their party.
Then a lot of them trooped out
and formed the Liberal Party
which, of course, will ultimate-
ly be controlled by smart Fair
Deal Democrats.
*
Meanwhile, Marcantonio has
gone his brazen way, scream-
ing against the "interests" and
arraying race against race,
class against class.
In California, Helen Gaha-
gan Douglas, who, incidentally,
got a somewnat sketeny cor-
lege education not too far from
Marcantonio's district, is mak-
ing much the same appeal as
is her fellow Congressman in
New York. The same pattern
of phraseology marks her
speeches as those of Marcan-
tonioâ€”"kept press," "monop-
oly interests," "vicious reac-
tionaries," "tools of big busi-
ness," etc., etc.
*
A long series of votes lie in
her record in which she sided
with Marcantonio and against
the great majority of her par-
ty. These votes included sev-
eral questions of security risks,
the continuation of the Un-
American Activities Commit-
tee, the citation of the Holly-
wood 10 for contempt, and oth-
ers.
It is this candidate and this
record that administration
brass has been and is continu-
ing to support by personal ap-
pearances in California. The
indefatigable Vice-President
has graced the State with his
frayed and well-thumbed
speech: "We are better off than
in 1932." Mrs. Roosevelt put
in a turn. Secretaries Chap-
man, Brannan, McGrath and
Adviser Harriman are sched-
uled.
*
The retiring Democratic Sen-
ator, Sheridan Downey, used to
be regarded as a radical. But
the new kind of radicalism is
too much for him, and he has
openly opposed Douglas.
Meanwhile, her opponent,
Richard Nixon, made an issue
against the whole Truman phi-
losophy as effectively as it has
been done in any State this
year.
The California voters are
given a square choice. Good ob-
servers out there report a close
race, with Nixon gaining
ground as election approaches.
