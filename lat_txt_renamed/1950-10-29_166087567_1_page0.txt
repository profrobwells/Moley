Machine-Rule Politicos
Face Rebellion at Polls
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The early results of the New
York Daily News pre-election
poll show that Acting Mayor
Vincent Impellitteri is run-
ning about 5-3 over the hand-
picked candidate of the power-
ful Democratic Tammany can-
didate, Judge Ferdinand Pe-
cora.
These odds may change be-
fore election. But if, as it now
seems, the public is getting
thoroughly fed up with ma-
chine rule, phony issues, and
political conniving, there may
be a number of very great sur-
prises on election day.
★
In this column a few days
ago, I recounted the incredible
and unworthy scheme by
which the New York bosses
denied a nomination to which
Impellitteri, a good Democrat
himself, was clearly entitled
by virtue of experience and
the office he held.
With no organized support,
Impellitteri has carried his
case to the people, and ap-
parently they are responding
with enthusiasm.
If any lessons can be drawn
from this, it is that people this
year are deeply worried about
their country and their deep
personal interests in the gov-
ernment of their country.
They are concerned about
our perilous situation in the
world and the individual's per-
ilous position in the economy
of the country. They want,
at long last, real competence
and efficiency in office. They
want to feel safe with their
government and with the peo-
ple in charge of their govern-
ment.
They do not feel safe with
machine rule. This is especial-
ly true in New York, where
widespread police scandals
are breaking out. It may well
be true in Chicago, where
equally wretched conditions
are coming to light. It may
also be true in Missouri. It
certainly looked that way in
that State in the primary, in
which the Truman machine
choice was soundly beaten.
★
If we may draw a further
inference, it is a bad omen for
all candidates who enjoy the
support of Federal machine
patronage.
The issues conjured up in
New York against Gov. Dewey
have been thoroughly phony.
No reasonable person denies
his capacity as an administra-
tor of State affairs. But that
issue has been beclouded by
spurious charges, slogans and
contemptuous epithets. If the
Impellitteri poll is correct, the
voters will break through the
machine-made smoke screen
and re-elect Dewey.
The apparent shift in senti-
ment in Ohio in Taft's favor is
another mark of this trend.
There, too, the arguments
against Taft have been spuri-
ous and contemptible. They
are arguments against integ-
rity, forthrightness, even
against education and hard
work.
In California, the trend is
toward Warren and Nixon—
again a mark of approval for
good public service and against
the shibboleths of statism, of
handouts and class hatred.
This trend might well be
noted by Vice-President Bark-
ley, the assorted members of
Truman's Cabinet and others
who are stumping the country
in behalf of machine-made
candidates.
★
The political leaders of la-
bor, too, might well consider
this popular demand for real
issues. Even their own union
members, the people who are
supplying the money that
these labor politicians are us-
ing to defeat Taft and others,
must be feeling the urge to
break through the unreal hul-
labaloo about the Taft-Hartley
Act and get down to real prob-
lems.
Once in a long time, this re-
volt against machine politics
takes place and sweeps every-
thing before it. It may hap-
pen this year.
