Taft Reported Gaining
in Ohio Campaign Finale
BY RAYMOND. MOLEY
With the blessing of un-
usually warm and fair weather
in Ohio, the Taft-anti-Taft bat-
tle has reached a climax in its
last week.
This favorable weather
makes for larger crowds, con-
serves the health of campaign-
ers and makes easier the
distribution of the final tons
of literature by both sides.
Under such favorable natural
auspices, Ohio is experiencing
the most desperate politicking
since the Bryan-McKinley
days.
*
Weather, however, especially
in this region, may change by
election day and many Re-
publicans hope that it will.
For experts in the strange
habit patterns of farmers say
that with fine weather on elec-
tion day they will find plenty
of necessary work around
home before snow flies and
thus may neglect their so-
called priceless right to vote.
They are not mad at any-
body this year. But if they
have the day off, most of them
will vote Republican and for
Taft.
That is one of the uncer-
tainties as the election ap-
proaches. But there are many
more.
I have been in Ohio several
times during the past year, ob-
serving the ups and downs of
this long and decisive political
contest. The last visit before
this was three weeks ago. At
that time the full impact of the
political agencies of labor were
being felt. Taft's stock had de-
clined and a majority of the
best political reporters on
Ohio newspapers believed that
Ferguson would win.
*
Now that opinion has
changed. Taft, they say, has
gained steadily as the end ap-
proaches. Almost every re-
porter believes that he will
win.
One reason for this is the
growing evidence that regular
Democratic organizations are
concentrating on local candi-
dates. The tendency of a
regular organization politician,
when an outside outfit like the
CIO-PAC comes in, is to say,
"Well, let them do it." Regular
Democratic meetings and ral-
lies have almost ceased to
exist. Ferguson appears more
and more as the candidate of
and for the labor political
leaders.
The big Cleveland Demo-
cratic organization, which has
no love for Lausche, Taft or
Ferguson, is keeping busy
fighting a proposed County
Charter and ignoring State-
wide candidates. Gov. Lausche
himself, independent and un-
predictable, maintains a stead-
fast silence on the Senator-
ship.
Even Ferguson's personal
political henchmen complain.
They say their hero has been
spirited away, as it were, by
the employees of the Labor
League, popped into a car
and carried about the country
for exhibit like a prize shock
of corn or a captured piece
of old artillery.
Moreover, there is evidence
that a considerable number of
local labor leaders who have
got on well with their em-
ployers are not happy about
this invasion. Their thousands
of dues-paying workers have
heard with respect Taft's ar-
guments for the Taft-Hartley
Act.
Taft's audiences, according
to observers who have trav-
eled with him, have grown
in size and enthusiasm.

On the other side are factors
which still throw doubt on
the result. Registration has
been good, but not very good.
There is danger that thou-
sands of laggard Republicans
will not vote. I saw in Cleve-
land the report sheets of Re-
publican canvasses which
show great numbers of voters
who have not made up their
minds or are indifferent. These
people may turn one way or
the other with the final winds
of emotions.
Besides, the Labor League
is mailing to every registered
voter in Cuyahoga County a
sample ballot. This is a tre-
mendous, costly, and possibly
effective spur to voters.
But hard work, organiza-
tion, and enormous amounts
of literature are in evidence
on both sides. And as noted
above, wise observers see a
drift toward Taft.
