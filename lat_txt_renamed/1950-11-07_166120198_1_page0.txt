THE LAST
GUESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

These reflections are written
after weeks of travel and ob-
servation during this Congres-
sional campaign: They appear
when voters have for the most
part made their decisions and
before the result is known.
It is all over but the shout-
ing, but nobody knows yet the
identity of the shouters. It
may be safe to predict that
the cheers will come from so
many sources and their nature
will be so mixed that nobody
will know exactly which party
has reason to claim a mandate.
Perhaps it will help explain
how confused are the currents'
operating in this election to
say that the summary in this
column a week ago of what
reporters were saying about
the results needs at this last
stage to be somewhat revised.
Some Senatorial races that
were running one way a week
ago seem to be running the
other way now. At any rate,
that is what this writer is hear-
ing from people on the spot.
There has been little change
of opinion on the party bal-
ance in the House of Repre-
sentatives. Everyone among
the reporters I have seen still
agrees that there will be fewer
Democrats and more Repub-
licans in the 82nd Congress.

The guesses as to those Re-
publican gains range from 15
to 30. It has been my expe-
rience that when a political
tide runs one way or the other,
it is likely to go beyond the es-
timate of most experts.
Hence, my guess of a week ago
of a House division of about
225 Democrats and 210 Repub-
licans still stands. That is a
Republican gain of 37 seats.
On the Senate side, my re-
ports a week ago were that a
Republican would surely re-
place a Democrat in Pennsyl-
vania and Idaho, that there
was an excellent chance for
Nixon in California and that
there was a fair chance for a
change in Illinois, Oklahoma,
Utah, Maryland, New York
and Connecticut. On the other
hand, a Republican loss was
probable in Colorado. Taft was
safe in Ohio, Donnell in Mis-
souri and Capehart in Indiana.
Out of all this I figured a Sen-
ate Republican gain of four
seats.

*

Now, a week later, reports
of changes come in. Pennsyl-
vania still looks like a Repub-
lican gain of one seat. Idaho
reports are a bit more confus-
ing but the best opinion favors
a gain of one Republican seat
there. Reports from Connecti-
cut are brighter for a gain of
at least one seat. And Califor-
nia looks better for another
Republican gain.
On the other hand, Repub-
lican Sen. Donnell in Missouri
seems, as reporters put it, to
be in trouble, while Repub-
lican Sen. Milliken in Colorado
looks safer.
The balance in Maryland,
Illinois, Oklahoma and Utah
looks narrow.
In New York, almost any-
thing can happen. The famous
Hanley letter is balanced by
an unfortunate Lehman letter
about Hiss.
In any event, New York will
have a man of letters in the
Senate. That is about all that
can be predicted for New York.
And so it would still seem
that a Republican gain of four
seats is a fair guess.
