The capacity of politicians to
beguile the public has been
shown many times but never
more than in the last three
months.
President Truman, last Sat-
urday night, provided the last
unction of reassurance before
the harsh tidings that even he
must announce after the elec-
tion. We have had a great vic-
tory, he said, we are in piping
prosperity. Our corporations
are making lots of money.
Farmers were never better off.
And our economy was never
more free. That was the pre-
election fairy tale. That was to
make secure his power in the
new Congress.
Now in the hope that the
long-beguiled public will for-
get and forgive and that things
will get better before another
election, the reality will
emerge.
The rude tidings of things-
as-they-are will hit us from
four sides, all at once.
First, the hard facts about
the extent of our military com-
mitments in Asia.
Second, the enormous size of
our enlarged military budget.
Third, the reality behind our
apparent prosperity.
Fourth, the extent to which
our planners in Washington
intend to control the economy.
Let us look at these in order:
Gen. MacArthur's statement
on Sunday went as far as his
powers would permit to tell us
that an entirely new war has
now begun. A commander in
the field cannot declare war.
He cannot declare that war
exists with a specified nation.
Hence he spoke of a new phase
of fighting with "alien Com-
munists." He assumed that the
headline writers would supply
the specifications.
The commitment of ground
troops in Korea, as was noted
in this column many weeks
ago, was a Presidential act in
which sound military plans and
opinions were brushed aside.
The genius of MacArthur and
the bravery of our outnum-
bered troops made early vic-
tories possible.
The thrust to the Manchu-
rian border will now be—in
fact has been—attributed to
MacArthur. It was a conse-
quence of the earlier commit-
ments, however. Now we are
on the verge of unlimited war.
The brighter side, however,
is this: the Chinese Commu-
nists are involved for a limited
objective—the protection of
hydroelectric works in the
Yalu valley. Perhaps that is
all they will try to accomplish.
Also the onset of winter in
the rugged North Korea will
postpone real fighting before
long. Possibly therefore a dip-
lomatic settlement may come.
The plans of Secretary Mar-
shall may or may not be an-
nounced all in one piece or by
installments. If the former is
the case, we shall hear of a
$40,000,000,000 bill for the next
year with unbelievably high
tax proposals.
The farmers were reminded
of their high income and high
prices. The latter, however,
have been reduced by deliber-
ate efforts of the administra-
tion to encourage inflation. The
superficial nature of this boom
will soon appear.
Finally, business will receive
the full impact of controls. Per-
haps even labor will be par-
tially curbed now that it has
gone all in for the President's
candidates. The specifications
for controls have been drawn.
They were withheld for an-
nouncement after election.
Hard months and years are
ahead. We must all be pre-
pared for that.
