Three Ways to Relieve
a Man-Power Shortage
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From the beginning of the
Korean war in June to Octo-
ber, the number of people em-
ployed in manufacturing has
increased nearly two million.
Unemployment has declined
by more than a million.
The difference between
these figures has been made
up from other sources. Such
sources, however, are severely
limited and the present ranks
of the unemployed offer little
promise of important recruit-
ment.
But the demands for work-
ers will go on. If we spend
$40,000,000,000 more for war
and defense, as seems likely,
during the next year, we shall,
on the basis of present work-
ing hours and efficiency in pro-
duction, need 6,000,000 more
workers. Where are these
people to be found?
Some of them can be found
if we dig down into the lower
age groups and some can be
found among women not now
listed either among the em-
ployed or unemployed. And if
civilian production is reduced,
some more can be diverted
into necessary war production.
But all these sources together
will not meet the needs of our
economic system when 1952
comes with no lessening of the
international tension.
There are three principal
measures of relief-measures
that are possible of attainment
if Congress, the administra-
tion, labor leaders, manage-
ment and people generally can
be made to take a construc-
tive and co-operative attitude.
The first is to add some time
to the working day all along
the line. If every worker
would add 10% to the number
of hours now worked, a large
part of the problem would be
solved. This could be done in
such a way as to offer ade-
quate protection to the present
normal working week. It could
be regarded as an emergency
device to be ended when the
international emergency ends.
And even if workers should
be 'paid 50% more for over-
time, there would be, in most
cases, sufficient savings in
overhead costs in the training
of new workers and in the
superior efficiency of those
who would be doing the over-
time work, over others who
might be brought in, to pay
the difference.
Some shortsighted and self-
ish union leaders may object
to this. They will object for
a number of reasons, one of
which is that the union treas-
ury is helped in accordance
with the number of people
employed and unionized. But
the net gain would be favor-
able to labor because it would
check inflation somewhat.
A second means of relief
could be increased productiv-
ity through greater efficiency.
Some of the means toward
this might be incentives to
reduce labor turnover, effi-
ciency premiums, reduction of
the number of brands during
the emergency and simplifica-
tion of packaging.
Finally, there is the mat-
ter of taxation. An excess-pro-
fits tax, among other things, is
an incentive toward the waste
of man power. When cost is
disregarded and profits are
wiped out, inefficiency and
waste set in. There is also a
ruthless competition for work-
ers and increased turnover.
These effects were shown in
the aftermath of the excess-
profits tax in the last war.
They would certainly appear
again in a much more serious
form.
These methods of relief call
for statesmanship in govern-
ment, labor and management.
But they would be a small
price to pay for the main-
tenance of a sound economy
in the great emergency ahead.
