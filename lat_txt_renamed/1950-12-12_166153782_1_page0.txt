We Get More Personal
Diplomacy; What Else?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Amid terrifying reports that
there was under consideration
the withdrawal of all western
strength from the Far East, in-
cluding Japan, President Tru-
man, Prime Minister Attlee
and their asserted helpers have
held talks behind closed doors
in Washington.
Since we have had bitter ex-
perience with these passages in
personal diplomacy or, in the
language of Foreign Offices,
"talks at the highest level,"
there is very great concern at
what we may call "lower
working and fighting levels"
about what the "high levels"
have pledged us to.
Twenty-four Republican
Senators have expressed this
concern of those who must
pay and die by demanding in
writing that there be full dis-
closure.
*
Certainly Attlee's state-
ments, which are in the best
Attlee double talk tradition,
provide no answer for Ameri-
cans who have repeatedly
been pledged by their elected
servants without their knowl-
edge and consent.
This time let there be no
misunderstanding. For in
previous "high level" affairs
the outcome has proved that
the participants subsequently
held quite confusing and con-
tradictory recollections of
what had been agreed upon.
It is all well and good for
Attlee to say that there will
be no appeasement of Red
China, but his government has
already given a full measure
of appeasement and recogni-
tion to the regime whose mil-
lion soldiers are killing Ameri-
can boys by the hundred.
It is all well and good to say
that the British soldiers in
Korea will be there as long as
ours. But they could not get
out if Attlee wanted to get
them out. We want more than
the customary tripe about a
"meeting of minds." We want
to know where they met and
how and what about.
*
In Attlee's case, he will have
to stand before the House of
Commons and answer ques-
tions. A keen opposition party
of about 300 members will be
allowed to ask those questions.
In this land of the some-
what less free, there is no
such device for holding public
servants to account. Inter-
rogation of the President by
the Senate was tried early in
the administration of George
Washington and the Father
of His Country left the cham-
ber in a towering rage, be-
stowing as he did so some of
his famous military profanity
upon the new council of
elders. Since then Presidential
contacts have been formal,
one-way affairs.
â˜…
Of course, Acheson, whose
removal is already the earnest
prayer of more than half of
the Senate and of most articu-
late Americans, will appear
before the Foreign Relations
Committee.
We want more than this
perfunctory kind of report and
more than the customary ora-
tory of the President. We
want to know where Ameri-
cans are to fight next and who
will help them fight. Also,
when are the bickering na-
tions of Europe going to de-
cide whether Germans are to
be permitted to help?
And when are we going to
arm a million Japanese to de-
fend their country and to
provide us with a defense of
our last line of resistance in
the Far East?
These and other pertinent
questions must have been on
the Truman-Attlee agenda.
