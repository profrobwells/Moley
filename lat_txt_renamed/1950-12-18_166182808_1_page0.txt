British By-elections
Give Labor No Cheer
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While it may be argued that
since the November election
President Truman has at the
very least a shaky hold on
the American electorate, there
can be no doubt about the
position on his own home front
of Prime Minister Attlee.
The British leader holds of-
fice by the narrowest of mar-
gins and there is evidence that
if an election were held now
he and his colleagues would
be pitched out.
In the February election the
Labor Party ran short of a
popular majority by nearly
2,000,000. Its Parliamentary
margin has hovered around
seven votes. And since Febru-
ary there have been unmistak-
able signs that the tide of opin-
ion has been running steadily
toward the Conservatives.

The most recent test was in
a constituency in Birming-
ham. It was a Conservative dis-
trict but in this by-election
the Conservatives won by a
larger margin than that by
which it was carried in Febru-
ary.
Altogether, there have been
seven by-elections since the
general election 10 months ago.
In the seven constituencies
thus tested, four had been
held by Labor members and
three by Conservatives. In these
elections there has been no
change in representation. But
in every case but one the re-
sults were bad news for La-
bor. Labor seats were won by
reduced majorities and Con-
servative seats by larger ones.

A very notable fact is that
in the election in Birmingham
and in another in Oxford,
where in February Liberal can-
didates received a large vote,
the results in the elections
since have shown that most
former Liberal votes have
gone to the Conservative can-
didates. This is evidence that
if the Liberal Party had aban-
doned its dog-in-the-manger at-
titude in February, Conserva-
tives would have won a clear
and fairly workable majority
and Churchill and not Attlee
would have been conferring
with Truman.
Attlee's position is made still
more impotent because of the
deep difference of opinion in
his own party. At least 100
members of his Parliamentary
group, which is about one-
third, are uncompromising So-
cialists, ready to buy peace
with Russia at almost any cost.
Constant appeasement of this
group is in order. Key Minis-
ters like Emmanuel Shinwell
in Defense, John Strachey in
the War Office and Aneurin
Bevan in Health are not only
troublesome for Attlee but un-
doubtedly deeply distrusted by
the country.
The Liberal group of nine
is torn with disagreements.
Their ranks break wide open
on important votes. All of
them hold their seats by nar-
row margins. And in another
election they might well be
wiped out by an electorate
more interested in survival
than in theories.
Despite the threat of war
it might be well to hold another
election and determine once
and for all what statesmen
really represent the British
nation.
