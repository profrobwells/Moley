Beware the Left-Wingers
Who Write the Directives
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Charles E. Wilson and Alan
Valentine, who should have
the confidence of sound peo-
ple, will direct economic mobi-
lization. But the innumerable
orders and directives will in
the large part be drafted by
the left-wing boys who in one
spot or another have held over
from the late war.
Information from that quar-
ter indicates their preliminary
intentions. Those intentions
follow two lines, both of which
have strong political implica-
tions. It remains to be seen
whether Charles Wilson will
put his strong arm on these
busy draftsmen and restrain
their tendency to use this cri-
sis to further the march to stat-
ism. But their preliminaries
bear watching.

The Baruch policy, an-
nounced in June, of imme-
diate and over-all price and
wage freezing will still be ig-
nored. Too many powerful in-
terests stand in the way. The
intention, however, is to move
cautiously toward that goal—
subject, of course, to the will-
ingness of the Kremlin to
avoid war for the present.
The next steps will be di-
rected at big industries such
as steel and automobiles. This
alleged profits of big business.
The automobile roll back,
canceling recently announced
price increases, will not be seri-
ous. Here was a very easy
step to take which can have
wide publicity. But what will
happen will cancel the advan-
tage to the consumer. Dealers
will simply cut back trade-in
values of old cars. For the gov-
ernment can control cars at
the doors of the plants, but
not beyond.
Next, for important whole-
sale and retail lines, there will
be freezing of gross profit mar-
gins or “markups,” probably at
the percentage levels of the
past few months.

In all cases there will be a
stabilization of wages as soon
as prices are fixed.
A long series of specifications
is needed as to the elements
involved in a fair price. This
latter idea is new in American
price controls, but it was well
known in Europe in both
world wars. It can mean that
the ESA will publish prices
or percentages of profit mar-
gins considered to be fair for
a number of business lines.
Also, that the ESA will use
a measuring rod something
like that used in public utility
rate regulation. And in defin-
ing “fairness,” the rule will
be something close to prewar
net profits.
Much of this planning is in
the realm of moral restraints.
In fact, much of the Truman
proclamation of an emergency
was in the way of exhortation
to the public and to dealers
and manufacturers to be rea-
sonable and patriotic.
In general, we are still in
the preliminary stages of mo-
bilization. And we are assum-
ing that we shall have a good
deal of time to prepare for
war.
