Two Books of Criticism
of Our Military Caste
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the previous column
there was described the ex-
traordinary labor of John
Joseph Lenney, once an en-
listed soldier, who spent 40
years in studying the problem
of promotion from the ranks
in the Regular Army.
The results of his study he
now publishes, at the age of 80,
in two small books: "Rankers"
and "The Caste System in the
American Army."
Lenney's studies carry the
subject back into the history
of the private soldier in the
English army and up to the
end of his statistical research
in the American Army.
It should be said, in fairness
to present conditions, that his
statistical research was con-
cluded more than 20 years ago.
His conclusion as of this year,
however, is that "America's
military institution and organ-
ization is not in harmony with
the political and social organ-
ization of the United States"
and that the presence of caste
"makes the national defense
both inefficient and extrav-
agantly costly."
His strictures concerning
West Point and Annapolis will
seem harsh to every American
who properly respects those
great institutions, and there
may well be strong arguments
against Lenney's conclusions.
But in the light of his long
and sincere study, the subject
deserves attention, since once
more the long arm of the mil-
itary is reaching into every
hamlet in the nation.
Lenney shows beyond a
doubt that Congress has al-
ways favored a larger degree
of promotion to the status of
officer from the ranks. A long
succession of acts of Congress
proves this. Lenney also says
that over the years the War
Department through its or-
ders, examinations and ap-
pointments has indicated its
sympathy with such promo-
tions.
He claims, however, that
these expressions of policy
were, up to the end of his
studies two decades ago, frus-
trated "by the manner in
which the various prelimi-
nary and competitive exami-
nation boards have exercised
their powers."
While Lenney disclaims
partisanship, he asserts that
with respect to promotion
from the ranks, Democratic
administrations have been
less sympathetic to promotion
from the ranks than have Re-
publican administrations. The
Act of 1892, which was in-
tended to be the "soldiers'
Magna Charta," was a Re-
publican measure.
Lenney presents an array
of facts and statistics which
clearly show the value of such
enlisted men as have received
commissions. The rate of
battle deaths of rankers, or
officers risen from the ranks,
in the Army from 1775 to
1924 was considerably higher
than that of officers drawn
directly from civil life or
from West Point. They have
been more likely to remain in
military life for long periods.
And their loyalty has been of
a very high order.
Moreover, Lenney asserts
that the cost to the Treasury
of rankers has been vastly
less than that of other officers.
In this he bases his judgment
on the fact that a ranker's pro-
motion costs nothing, while
the education of an officer at
West Point is expensive.
It would be unwise to as-
sume from Lenney's studies
that West Point and Annapo-
lis are not indispensable na-
tional assets. He himself dis-
claims any such assumption.
But since we probably face a
future in which a larger Army
will be essential, Congress
and the public at large might
well insist that promotion
from the ranks be given more
attention than it has in the
past.
