'You're Another' Technique
Applied to Foreign Policy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Apparently, it is not only
music critics that move President
Truman to ill-tempered,
banal and not altogether sensible
replies.
This mood seems to prevail
against anyone who has suggestions
about foreign or domestic
policy which disagree
in any way from those of the
administration. And since it
is not clear what the Truman
policies really are, this "you're
another" technique is applied
to any constructive suggestions
from any source. People
apparently are expected to
bow humbly and maintain a
discreet silence.
In his remarks about the
Hoover speech, the President
sounded like a man in the
midst of a rough-and-tumble
campaign where all is forgotten
except name calling. This
mood is exceedingly disturbing
at a moment when the
great values of civilization are
at stake.
The President's crack at
Sen. Byrd, whose offense was
to present a list of reasonable
economies in nondefense expenditures,
was equally out of
order. His remark was that
he doesn't think Sen. Byrd
knows very much about the
budget. The "round of laughter"
that greeted this must have
been directed by the reporters
at the President, because they
know and probably every
member of the Senate who has
served long with Sen. Byrd
knows that the man from Virginia
has made the budget the
subject of indefatigable study
for more years than Mr. Truman
has been in Washington.
The State Department seems
to have caught the infection
that afflicts the President. Its
announcement that John Foster
Dulles would "reply to
Hoover" was not only untrue,
according to Dulles himself,
but a wholly ridiculous assumption.
It was politically
inspired, of course, because the
obvious purpose was to reveal
division in the Republican
Party.
Since Dulles was employed
by the State Department as a
Republican and to provide a
faint and very deceptive appearance
of co-operation between
the parties, could it be
assumed that he would permit
himself to be used as a stooge
for the administration?
This Dulles has himself repudiated
and if he is attempting
to bridge the gap between
the administration and Mr.
Hoover, as he undoubtedly is,
he will have to accept enough
of Hoover's contentions to
deny the President's charge of
isolationism.
The facts that come from
European dispatches every day
and the comment in responsible
British journals and
newspapers make it clear that
the rearmament of Europe is
not so bright a prospect as
Messrs. Truman and Acheson
would have us believe. In
short, they are not telling
Americans the bitter truth.
â˜…
In appointing Gen. Eisenhower
to command European
forces, the administration is
following the policy of those
Republicans who believe that,
with Eisenhower at the head
of their party, all will be well.
For the offering of the general
to Europe is still only a
token. A general is not an
army, just as a head is not
a man.
All the problems that have
perhaps fatally delayed the
arming of Europe still are unsolved.
French suspicions,
British incompetence and German
bargaining still reduce
matters to an impasse.
But high among all our problems,
foreign and domestic, is
the problem of the President's
capacity to restrain his tendency
to make snap decisions, to
curb his irritation in the face
of honest criticism, and to supplement
his own scanty equipment
with the best and wisest
counselors in the nation.
