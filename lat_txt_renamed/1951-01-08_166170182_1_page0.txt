MISQUOTED
HOOVER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A very dangerous human
frailty has already appeared in
the debate on foreign policy
precipitated by Herbert Hoo-
ver's speech.
This human failing will
grow in seriousness as the
weeks pass in the major de-
bate in the Senate and else-
where on our duties and re-
sponsibilities in the world. It
is the tendency to get farther
and farther from the facts that
starts an argument. It is char-
acteristic of all argument,
even over the question of
whether daughter Mary or son
Jimmy shall use the car on
Sunday afternoon.
★
The words that start a de-
bate are paraphrased by the
opponent in a way to suit his
answer. Then someone else
submits a new version of the
paraphrase, and so on. Final-
ly, the battle is carried on
with wholly new premises and
about wholly different values.
Webster recognized this in
his introductory words in his
reply to Hayne. "When the
mariner has been tossed for
many days in thick weather,"
he said, "he naturally avails
himself of the first pause in
the storm to take his latitude
and ascertain how far the ele-
ments have driven him from
his true course." And so he
asked to have the basic res-
olution read.
Sometimes it is a question
of semantics. The same words
have various meanings for
various people. More often,
there is the political instinct
to pervert the position of the
opposition. Always, there is
the habit of lazy minds to use
without discrimination catch-
words and cliches to convey
meaning.
★
To get our bearings on Hoo-
ver, we must remember that
his speech was intended to re-
assure bewildered and fright-
ened Americans and sharply
to warn indifferent and unrea-
sonable Europeans who, to use
Hoover's word, "higgle" in the
face of peril. If this warning
fails, he said, we should not
"land another man or another
dollar on their shores."
In line with some of our
own brethren, European pa-
pers uttered a great cry of
"isolationism." However, on
New Year's Day, the London
Times, after measured thought,
reached a different conclusion.
It deserves credit for what it
said 12 days after Hoover
spoke:
★
"(The speech) was not only
a warning to the White House
itself of the continual need to
make sure that the American
passion for freedom is
matched by understanding of
what is in fact at stake. It was
also, in its way, a solemn re-
minder to the peoples of West-
ern Europe-and, not least, to
the British people-that if
peace is to be successfully de-
fended, with all the might of
the United States behind it,
they have themselves to do
their duty in coming months."
That is the issue that Hoo-
ver has presented. Let it be
recalled from time to time as
the debate proceeds.
