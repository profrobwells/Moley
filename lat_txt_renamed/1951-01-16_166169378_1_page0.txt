Sen. Byrd's proposal of a
Federal sales tax has not been
explained in detail, but it is
assumed that he means a tax
levied on retail sales.
There is great need for a
thorough consideration of this
means of raising new revenue,
not because it is the best
means but because it raises
fundamental questions that
need airing before Congress
tries to squeeze present in-
come-tax payers still further.
There are three strong argu-
ments for a Federal retail
sales tax. First, it would yield
a great deal. Second, it would
be noticed and therefore un-
derstood that this war effort
is something that everyone
should help to support. Third,
its objectionable features are
so obvious that, after the
emergency, we might easily
get rid of it.
The last time a general sales
tax was widely discussed was
in the hard days of the de-
pression, Roosevelt was urged
to use it, but it failed to win
his fancy. His objections
were largely rooted in poli-
tics. The labor union leaders
objected because, they said,
it would be a tax upon the
poor.
A decisive economic objec-
tion to it at that time was its
deflationary character. That
objection would not be valid
now, because we need all the
deflationary forces that we
can find.
A fairly serious objection to
a retail sales tax is that its
enforcement would require a
tremendous amount of red
tape and a vastly enlarged bu-
reaucracy. The number of re-
tail outlets where a sales tax
would be collected, even if
food were excluded, has rough-
ly been estimated at 3,000,000.
Collections would require on-
erous paper work and an army
of collectors.
An easier way to spread the
load on consumers would be
a general manufacturers' ex-
cise tax. That would tax con-
sumers' goods at their place of
origin, and the burden would
of course be passed on to the
buyers. Such a tax would
yield whatever amount Con-
gress wished to raise.
It has been reliably esti-
mated that a 5% tax of this
kind would yield between
$1,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,-
000. A higher rate would yield
more. Perhaps $10,000,000,000
to $15,000,000,000 could be the
take.
A manufacturers' excise tax
would be much easier to col-
lect than a retail sales tax,
since the places where it
would be collected would be
fewer and easier to control.
It has been estimated that
the number of manufacturers
and others who would pay it
would number about 300,000,
or one-tenth of the retail out-
lets. It would be collected at
the final point of manufacture.
This would avoid double or
triple taxes on various proc-
esses.
There are three major rea-
sons why we must find a new
and very broad base for fur-
ther revenue raising. One is
that we are very close to the
point of no return in the per-
sonal income tax. Another is
that bonds are going to be
very, very hard to sell to the
public.
And if we force the banks to
take the bonds we shall be
adding fuel to the fire of in-
flation.
