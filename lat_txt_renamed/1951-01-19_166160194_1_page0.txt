DEBATE BUT
NO SCHISM
By RAYMOND MOLEY
Last Sunday I concerned
myself with seeing and hear-
ing four radio and television
discussions of foreign policy.
Later in the day I had what
was scheduled to be a half-
hour "debate" on television
with an all-out globalist and
collective securityist.
A number of fairly impor-
tant conclusions occur to me
after this experience in hear-
ing, seeing and talking.
The first is that if we shake
all this talk down to its es-
sence there is no fundamental
division of opinion. The dif-
ferences relate to ways and
means, some of which need a
great deal of thought before
agreement can be reached.
*
A second conclusion is that
too many of us are talking
about what somebody else has
said, rather than what we
think by and for ourselves.
A third is the great defect of
all debate, which is the tend-
ency of participants to put a
slanted interpretation on what
the other fellow says and then
lustily to demolish the straw
argument thus created.
When we speak of the essen-
tial agreement of the major
figures who have made
speeches on the subject we can
well rule out such utterances
as that of Ex-Ambassador Ken-
nedy, who advocated almost
complete abandonment of our
implied commitments beyond
the Western Hemisphere and
our strategic outposts.
We can also ignore the reck-
less position taken by such
people as my Sunday oppo-
nent, who would thrust our
limited forces into every dan-
ger spot in the world. This, I
may add, is what is known in
New York as the Park Ave.
or cafe society position. It is
a very charitable interpreta-
tion of this position to say
that the resources and inter-
ests of the United States are
almost wholly subordinated to
the needs, real or imaginary,
of other countries and that it
centers its concern on Europe,
not Asia.
*
But among such spokesmen
as Hoover, Taft, Dulles, Stas-
sen and Truman there is a
consideration of ways, means
and capacities. All agree that
we will fight if Western Eu-
rope is attacked; all recognize
our concern in protecting the
vast resources of the Middle
East and Africa, and all would
build up our own defensive
and striking power to the ut-
most.
The second point mentioned
above was well illustrated Sun-
day in the joint discussion of
Sens. Dirksen and Douglas and
in Harold Stassen's meeting
with the press.
It seems to be an obsession
of moderators to turn the dis-
cussion to what their guests
think about Hoover, Taft, or
somebody else, rather than to
get their guests to discuss is-
sues on their own.
And guests are likely to fall
into this byplay unless they
resolutely resist the tempta-
tion. It was therefore disap-
pointing to have a commentary
by Dirksen and Douglas on
Hoover, rather than the opin-
ions of the two men them-
selves.
*
Stassen's interviewers side-
tracked him into giving his
views about Taft's position. He
said he did not agree with
Taft, but he failed to state why
and he failed to give his alter-
native prescription.
Such discussion does not
help Americans to form their
own judgments.
The worst feature of the cur-
rent debate is the tendency to
misrepresent what someone
has said and then to demolish
the misrepresentation, often
with contemptuous epithets.
My opponent Sunday stated
flatly that he disagreed whol-
ly with Hoover and Taft and
then claimed that Hoover
would "crawl into his shell."
A "shell" extending from the
North Sea to the Sea of Japan
and from the North to the
South Poles is pretty bigâ€”
that being the Hoover area for
defense. But such considera-
tions have a hard time against
name calling and political slo-
gans.
Everyone at the moment is
awaiting Gen. Eisenhower's
report on Europe. For the mo-
ment, both sides are disposed
to accept his judgment, pro-
vided it is straightforward,
publicly, not privately, ex-
pressed, and constructive.
*
If, however, the general
evades the real issue the
wave of doubt and controversy
will mount, and quite probably
that may seriously impair the
general's great and deserved
popularity. No man has ever
faced a greater responsibility
and opportunity. He can re-
solve this debate in the minds
of all reasonable people, or he
can intensify it. We wait and
hope.
