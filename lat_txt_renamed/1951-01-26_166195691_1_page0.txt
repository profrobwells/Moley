Truman's Tax Program
Paints a False Picture
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The passion of President
Truman for higher and still
higher discriminatory taxes
may still justify the Republi-
can taunt, "High Tax Harry."
For it is hard to see any im-
mediate situation which re-
quires hasty and drastic rais-
ing of rates.
If Congress will assert its
constitutional rights and, as
Sen. Byrd demands, cut from
$5,000,000,000 to $7,000,000,000
of nonessentials from the Tru-
man budget we may get by in
fiscal 1951 with no deficit at
all and in fiscal 1952 with a
relatively small one.
★
The school of economic
thought which holds this en-
couraging view has on its side
a body of evidence from previ-
ous years which is challeng-
ing, if not entirely convincing.
The fiscal year 1950, which
ended on June 30, 1950, had a
nominal deficit of $3,100,000,-
000.. There was, however, no
cash deficit at all.
Employment taxes yielded
for the Social Security account
about $3,000,000,000 more than
was needed for that fund, and
this surplus was turned in
to nonnegotiable government
bonds. This sort of financing
is, of course, a cruel joke on
Social Security but it does
provide current funds for
other government purposes.
★
This actual although dubi-
ous method of raising money
will continue, and there will
continue to be a greater yield
from the same tax rates. The
demands on Social Security
funds will decline during a
period of full employment.
There will be less demand for
relief, and plenty of jobs for
older people.
We can conservatively ex-
pect a repetition of the 1950
$3,000,000,000 from Social Se-
curity in the next two years.
★
But there will be a much
more important source of in-
creased revenue from existing
tax rates. As this column has
repeatedly pointed out over
the past four years, receipts
from tax rates rise faster
relatively than an increase in
national income and gross na-
tional product. Hence, in
years when that happened,
President Truman's estimates
of tax income were billions
short of actual receipts.
This year, his advisers have
partially caught up with this
economic law, but hardly
enough to justify the demand
for higher taxes.
The President's Council of
Economic Advisers reports
that for the first half of fiscal
1951—that is, up to Jan. 1, 1951
—there was a surplus of $3,-
900,000,000. This was despite
the Korean war and the fact
that the new tax rates imposed
last year had not gone into ef-
fect. Moreover, the heaviest
tax receipts come in January
and March.
Therefore, it is probable that
instead of Truman's predicted
deficit of $2,700,000,000 for fis-
cal 1951, there will be a fairly
sizable surplus with no new
taxes.
For 1952, Truman estimates
expenditures of $71,600,000,000;
receipts, $55,100,000,000; defi-
cit, $16,500,000,000. Let us an-
alyze this predicted deficit.
★
It is a fair guess that even
if Sen. Byrd fails to cut the
nonessentials, this huge defi-
cit will not be realized when
June 30, 1952, rolls around.
Always with the proviso that
full-scale war with Russia does
not develop before then!
There cannot be the slight-
est doubt that our current
rate of national income of
$250,000,000,000 will be exceed-
ed in fiscal 1951 and fiscal 1952.
Two or three million addi-
tional people will be employed.
The government will spend
$27,000,000,000 more, and the
secondary income from this
will add an even larger
amount to the total national
income.
★
It may be anticipated, there-
fore, that the rate of national
income will reach $300,000,000,-
000 to $310,000,000,000. The
rule mentioned above would
give us about 15% greater re-
ceipts, which would raise the
Truman figure to almost $63,-
000,000,000. We can add to
this the $3,000,000,000 Social
Security surplus. So that even
without real economy, a fiscal
1952 deficit would be around
$5,000,000,000.
★
This picture is not to sug-
gest that we shall have no
evil results from our Federal
finances. We shall have infla-
tion, and we are deluding our-
selves about Social Security.
For the bonds must be re-
deemed in the future. But that
Truman's demand for higher
taxes is based on dubious
grounds can hardly be denied.
