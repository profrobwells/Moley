Our casualties in Korea,
even at the present slow rate
of fighting, are mounting at
the rate of more than a thousand a week. Last week's report put the total figure at
46,201.
This is serious business. Expressed in human terms, it
means tragedy in tens of thousands of American homes.
In terms of the future fiber
of our nation it means the
steady attrition of our stock
of vital, venturesome young
men who would in a decade or
two be the driving power in
our economic, social and political life.
In terms of military
strength it means the loss of
a larger part of the flower of
our small Army, which must
be the basis of a larger Army
now in the blueprint stage and
our protection against the
looming peril of the future.
For these casualties are
overwhelmingly among fighting men and, as we know,
fighting men are only a minor
proportion of those who make
up a military establishment.
The rest are serving the fighting men.
I suppose that in terms of
diplomacy, "faces" are being
saved by this continuation of
hopeless resistance against the
multitudinous hordes of Asi-
atics. We are told that that
shadowy figment of international chit-chat, our "prestige"
or the "prestige" of the white
man in Asia, is being saved.
We may also be saving President Truman's face or Dean
Acheson's or that of our top
brass.
But "faces" can be rehabilitated. They have no maimed
bodies to carry through life
and no graves to hide in. Forgetfulness or the luster of another day restores them. No
other day can restore our
honored dead.
If this hopeless struggle is
intended to justify the hasty
decision that sent our ground
troops into Korea in June the
effort is futile. Nor can it
justify the decision to go
north of the 38th parallel. For
enough of those decisions is
now known to mark them as
fatal mistakes.
Evidence is mounting that
sound military men, high in
rank, who know more of Asia
than Marshall, Bradley or Truman can ever know, believed
the committing of ground
troops in Korea to be a mistake. Gen. MacArthur is said,
on very reliable authority, to
have so informed John Foster
Dulles in Tokyo before the die
was cast.
It was apparently a decision
of our civilian Commander in
Chief, momentarily playing
the role of amateur strategist,
meekly approved by the very
top brass in Washington and,
of course, hastily agreed to by
a befuddled Secretary of State.
I have been in a number of
widely separated American
cities, and everywhere there is
strong sentiment for withdrawing our ground troops
and for continuing air and
naval attacks.
Perhaps to call this strong
sentiment is an understatement. The fact is that feeling
is growing more and more bitter and pronounced. There is
little faith in the help our allies are giving us, and there is
a growing despair in the
United Nations. This sentiment may grow to panic proportions, which would be most
unfortunate.
It is time to get our troops
out. Then we can reinforce
our opposition against any
appeasement with Red China,
consider all aspects of European policy and move toward
the restoration of the Japanese economy and of Japan's
power to defend itself. We
could then bargain from
strength, not from distress as
at present.
