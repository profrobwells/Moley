CRIME AND
POLITICS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Far from Washington's war
problems, Sen. Kefauver is en-
ergetically moving his inquisi-
tion from elty to city. His fun-
damental purpose is to estab-
lish the theory upon which
his committee was set up by
the Senate. That purpose was
to show the interstate char-
acter of big-time criminal op-
erations.
*
Each city, however, provides
new headlines, and in each
case it is to be hoped that the
community is alerted to dan-
gers in its midst. Ultimately,
Sen. Kefauver will reach his
own State of Tennessee, and it
will be interesting to see what
is unearthed in the Memphis
machine, which without suc-
cess sought to defeat Kefauver
in his race for the Senate.
The net outcome of the Ke-
fauver investigation presum-
ably will be proposals for new
Federal legislation enlarging
the power of Federal law-en-
forcement machinery.
Such enlargement of the
Federal power has been going
on ever since various forms of
communication, transportation
and other avenues for unlaw-
ful activities became inter-
state rather than local. And
there is undoubtedly definite
need for stronger aids in law
enforcement.
*
However, there is always
danger that in turning to the
Federal government for the
control of crime we shall im-
pair the vigor of State and lo-
cal agencies. When the FBI
or other Federal enforcement
agencies come into a local sit-
uation, the authorities tend to
"let Uncle Sam do it." Local
responsibility flags, and ex-
cuses are provided for lazy
and incompetent police and
prosecution.
The Kefauver committee, if
it will venture to do so, can
highlight a very important de-
velopment in Federal-State re-
lations.
It is proverbial that when
a local government is vested
with the duty of special law
enforcement, there grows up a
sinister connection between
local politics and crime. The
promoters of criminal activity
naturally attempt to control
enforcement through political
connections.
*
This is especially true in the
the handling of crimes such
as gambling, in which there
are large financial returns and
also in which there is a large
part of the population that
regards such activity as per-
missible. This is the abiding
disease of machine politics.
The issue of this sort of cor-
rupting influence at the Fed-
eral level now rises. We have
been developing a species of
machine politics at the Fed-
eral level, especially since the
rise of Harry Truman—an old
local machine member—to the
Presidency.
*
The extension of law en-
forcement in the Federal gov-
ernment opens the way for
connections between crime and
politics on a larger scale. The
participants are bigger
"shots," and the stakes are
higher. But the old rules pre-
vail.
This is what Sen. Kefauver
must attack, if his investiga-
tion is to be anything more im-
portant than a stirring of lo-
cal pools of inquiry.
