Organized Crime Still
With Us in New Forms
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since those days, 30-odd
years ago, when Chicago,
Cleveland and other cities be-
stirred themselves about the
problem of organized crime,
a great many things have hap-
pened in and to our civiliza-
tion.
In those days, and notably
a little later, in the 1920s,
many of those cities organized
citizens' agencies such as
crime commissions and
through them put sufficient
heat upon enforcement officers
to bring about improvements.
The Kefauver committee in
its travels through the cities
is now showing the need of
some sort of action again.
But the patterns of the prob-
lem have changed, although
the flaws in human nature
that cause crime remain the
same. These patterns change
from generation to generation
with the progress—if we may
call it progress—of civilization.

In the period from the end
of World War I to the 30s, I
participated in investigations
of criminal law enforcement
in a good many cities, includ-
ing Chicago, Cleveland, St.
Louis, Kansas City and New
York.
Everywhere I found the
cause for the great growth of
organized crime to be the shift
in interest of the Capones and
others of his ilk from the
meager profits of protected tin-
horn gambling and prostitu-
tion to the lush gains of boot-
legging.
Then prohibition was re-
pealed and the government
raked in the money produced
by the illimitable thirst of
mankind. And the Capones,
like Othello, found their “oc-
cupation gone.”
Now Kefauver is finding
new and different patterns of
crime.
★
In the first place, there is a
lot of money in circulation,
what with full employment
and inflation.
Next, the inventive mind of
man has contrived interest-
ing new ways to throw mon-
ey away, such as slot ma-
chines. Communications are
better, and this enables gam-
bling to operate on a national
scale.
People who never saw a
horse race are betting their all
on the nags that they know
only by name. As far as bet-
tors are concerned, those
horses might be as mythical
as Pegasus.
Automobiles and good roads
are moving gambling out into
the country. Los Angeles, for
example, has grown so rapid-
ly and haphazardly that many
safe islands exist in the coun-
ty that the city police cannot
reach.
This movement of gambling
out into the country has
thrown the most astute and
well-heeled crooks squarely in-
to the jurisdiction of the most
antiquated and incompetent
office in the nation, the Sher-
iff.
★
This office has changed very
little in character since its
dim origins in medieval Eng-
land. He operates generally
under no board or other au-
thority.
There is a sort of responsi-
bility to a remote Governor,
but that control means very
little. There is little auditing
of the Sheriff’s books, and
there are no real tests of fit-
ness in his choice of deputies.
Moreover, the removal of
the big centers of gambling
from urban life permits them
to escape measurably from
the sharp eyes of the city
newspapers—always in the old
days the eternal prods behind
law enforcement officers.
The pressure of organized
crime always seeks the weak-
est spots for its heaviest at-
tack. The basketball scandals
in New York are an example.
★
When most of us were very
young, this game was a rather
unimportant stopgap between
the football and the baseball
seasons. Now green and impe-
cunious college boys are play-
ing to vast crowds with im-
mense gate receipts far from
the campus.
Big money temptations are
thrown against immature and
largely unwatched kids. A col-
lege president in New York
testified a few years ago that
he had never known of bet-
ting on games. If so, he was
about the only adult in New
York who was so ignorant.
And so goes the chase. The
conscience of the people, pre-
sumably entrusted in law en-
forcement officers, chasing the
elusive violators of law. To-
day, capture seems to be as-
sured. Tomorrow, the crooks
are in “fresh fields and pas-
tures new.”
