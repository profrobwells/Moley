Truman Shares Spoils
in Setting Up Controls
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On a trip to Nebraska and
Iowa it is easy to note a growing
cynicism concerning the
first steps taken by the President
in meeting his proclaimed
emergency.
The most recent of these
steps shows naked politics at
its worst. Tens of thousands
of jobs are involved in price-wage
control. In the late war the
number of full-time salaried
positions ran between 60,000
and 90,000. Among these were
many sizable plums worth more
than $5000 a year.
In the Roosevelt years, however,
there was always the appearance
if not the reality of establishing
some sort of test other than
political service in making
appointments. To be perfectly
fair to the late President, his
impulse was to hold in restraint
the voracious appetites of job-
minded politicians from Ambassadorships
to lowly clerkships. This often
irked politicians, but they had
to limit their expressions of
anguish to private conversations.

It is different now. The old
rule that to the victor belong
the spoils is openly proclaimed
and observed. And the victors
in the White House lexicon are
the heroes of the 1948 miracle.
To reassure the country and
presumably to win the confidence
of the industrialists, without
whom there could be no tanks,
planes and guns, Charles Wilson
was appointed as economic czar.
But the frailty of the czar's
scepter is already apparent. Alan
Valentine was no party hack. He
failed to hold on. Eric Johnston,
definitely more politically
minded, succeeded him.
But with Michael DiSalle, an
authentic Fair Dealer, the
political business began, and
Wilson, apparently very busy
with his industrialists, has decided
to let DiSalle handle the details.
These details involve the shaking
of the plum tree.
In Nebraska, which sends no
Democrats to Congress, price-wage
control patronage goes through
the regular Democratic organization,
and to make matters perfectly
secure, the Democratic political
leader out there gets the big job
himself.
In Iowa, which has Democratic
Sen. Gillette, there is deference
to the Senatorial political supremacy.

Hence, through the good offices
of Sen. Gillette, the supreme
Democratic command in Washington
presents Al Loveland for district
price-wage administrator. Loveland
is in a real sense a Democratic
lame duck, for he left the Department
of Agriculture to run unsuccessfully
for the U.S. Senate.
His "business" experience has
been that of a government employee
for years, running back to the
beginning of Roosevelt's AAA.
Reports from Washington indicate
that price-wage jobs are going
only to Democrats, and Truman
Democrats at that. Dixiecrats and
Republicans are barred. Presumably,
on the home front where there will
be no casualties, this will be a
strictly Democratic war.
It is small wonder that there is
widespread cynicism about price-wage
control. The grounds for this began
when Congress gave the President
discretionary powers.
It mounted when no plans were
made for the stupendous job over
the months since. It rose higher
when no businessman was selected
as chief but, instead, a routine
politician such as DiSalle. It grew
further over a comedy of errors
about a "30-day freeze." It is
complete now, when a week of
freezing is succeeded by a week
of thawing and jobs are handed
out to hungry partisans.
