Apparently President Tru-
man decided that to demand
new taxes for all of his $16,-
500,000,000 estimated 1952 def-
icit might expose the whole
phony skeleton of his budget.
So he decided to divide the
fraud in two installments, on
the theory that the smaller
the deceit the less likely the
discovery. So it is $10,000,000,-
000 now, and the rest later.
Two weeks ago I pointed
out in this column the rea-
sons why new taxes of the
kind that the President had in
mind, on the face of his
figures and the certain future
course of national production,
are not justified. Now, after
the Truman tax message, I
summarize those reasons.
For fiscal 1950--ending June
30 last--there was no cash def-
icit but, rather, a small cash
surplus. That was due to the
availability of $3,000,000,000
collected for Social Security
and not used.
The same $3,000,000,000 or
more will be collected in fiscal
1951 and in fiscal 1952. This
must enter into a real apprais-
al of the future situation. It
means that for fiscal 1951
there may be little or no def-
icit and for fiscal 1952 an in-
itial minimum of $3,000,000,000
must come off the $16,500,000,-
000 estimated deficit.
This prognosis is fortified
by the fact that in a period
of full-plus employment there
is less demand for Social Se-
curity money in all depart-
ments except pensions.
The President's Council of
Economic Advisers has al-
ready admitted that for the
first half of fiscal 1951 there
was a surplus of nearly $4,000,-
000,000.
This rapid rise in receipts
will grow and grow, for the
simple reason that the nation-
al income and gross product
will grow. It will rise very
rapidly in dollar amounts be-
cause there will be more peo-
ple employed, more wages for
those already employed, more
goods made and sold and more
inflation.
Tax receipts always rise
more rapidly, relatively, than
national income â€” largely be-
cause of graduated income tax
rates. Hence, every half year
until June 30, 1952, we will
get news of this rise. It would
not be surprising if the Tru-
man estimate of receipts, at
present rates, of $55,000,000,-
000 were exceeded by perhaps
$5,000,000,000. That would
whack another $5,000,000,000
from the predicted deficit,
bringing it down to about $8,-
000,000,000.
This is where Congress
comes in. Sen. Byrd's plan
calls for cutting more than $9,-
000,000,000 from fiscal 1951 ex-
penditures. If this amount is
Byrd's estimate for the cur-
rent year, we may assume that
the estimated cut should be
higher for fiscal 1952.
Of course, it would be futile
to expect Congress to rise to
such an austere height. But
if it should bring itself to cut
$1,000,000,000 or $5,000,000,000
from expenditures the fiscal
1952 deficit could drop to some-
where between $3,000,000,000
and $4,000,000,000.
So with such a reduced def-
icit in prospect the problem of
raising taxes presents an en-
tirely new and greatly reduced
aspect. The margin could be
covered by closing the "loop-
holes" that the President is
talking about and perhaps by
a small general manufacturers'
excise tax of not more than
5%.
What the President as a
politician really wants to do is
to pluck the taxpayers' feath-
ers with one hand while he
administers the national emer-
gency opiate with the other.
Then, whatever comes, there
will be money for the hand-
outs so essential in winning
elections,
