Truman Flouts Intent
of Federal Reserve Act
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We are learning fast that a
President whose limited re-
spect for great constitutional
principles is matched only by
his stubborn drive for power
can become a greater danger
to those principles than strong
but informed Presidents like
Woodrow Wilson.
Closely following Truman's
headlong plunge in Korea and
his determination to reserve
the right to place a standing
army in Europe is his effort to
dictate the policies of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board. This is
no mere squabble over half a
point in interest rates, but a
great constitutional issue.
If, as is reputed, the Presi-
dent is fond of history he
might turn with profit to the
story of the origins of the
Federal Reserve System. He
can find that record in a book
by Carter Glass, the legislative
sponsor of the Federal Re-
serve Act, entitled "An Adven-
ture in Constructive Finance."
The record. also appears in
the various papers of Wood-
row Wilson and in the Wilson
biography by Ray Stannard
Baker.
The historical setting of the
act was the heyday of pro-
gressivism before the first
world war. Wilson's economic
philosophy held that private
monopoly was rampant and
needed to be checked. He held
that monopoly was fostered
by credit control centralized
in the big New York banks.
As a Jeffersonian the new
President sought to decentral-
ize that control in districts
under reserve banks privately
owned but vested with a quasi-
public character. He insisted
that the Federal Reserve
Board be composed of mem-
bers appointed by the Presi-
dent and that it be govern-
mental in nature. In this he
was following the advice of
William Jennings Bryan and
Louis D. Brandeis.
There was tremendous op-
position by the bankers who
favored a system in which the
banks would be represented
on the board in Washington,
Carter Glass, fearing political
control, at first supported the
bankers.
The result was a compromise
in which it was made perfect-
ly clear that while the mem-
bers of the board should be
appointed by the President
their terms would be long and
overlapping. It was clearly
understood at the time that the
board should be independent
of the President. For a while
the Secretary of the Treasury
was an ex officio member, but
to emphasize the independence
of the board he was later ex-
cluded by Congress.

Moreover, the board was
made free of dependence on
Congress, for its expenses are
paid by the Federal reserve
banks.
All this was to protect the
board utterly and irrevocably
from political control.
But now, despite this his-
tory and despite the legal posi-
tion of the board, the Presi-
dent and the Secretary of the
Treasury presume to issue or-
ders to the board on the vital
matter of interest rates.
Back in the boom days be-
fore the depression the Fed-
eral reserve bank in Chicago
wanted to raise the discount
rate in an effort to check in-
flation. But the board in Wash-
ingten prevented it.
★
It was noted at the time
that this was owing to the
administration's desire to keep
money cheap so that Europe
could borrow here and so that
Britain could maintain sterling
parity.
In that instance the board
permitted the administration
to dominate it, with the dis-
astrous result that inflation in
stocks continued until the
crash.
Something of the same sort
may happen again if the Presi-
dent prevails. The board has
only two options — resigna-
tion or inflexible opposition.
