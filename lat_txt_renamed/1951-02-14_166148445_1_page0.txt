INTEREST ON
U.S. DEBT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is far beyond the capac-
ity of one commentator to
keep up with the deceptions
and misrepresentations of the
Truman taxing and spending
program. The deceptions are
too numerous and the general
misrepresentations too great.
About all that this writer can
do is to pick out a few
whoppers and expose them for
what they are.
The task today is to exam-
ine one of Secretary Snyder's
arguments against the Federal
Reserve Board's desire to raise
the interest rate from 2½%
to 3%.

The Secretary is quoted as
saying that to pay one-half
of one per cent more interest
on the government debt would
cost the Treasury $1,250,000,-
000. This is probably true, as
far as it goes. Our national
debt is very large, and even at
low rates of interest the gov-
ernment must pay out bil-
lions in servicing it.
I suppose Secretary Snyder
means that to pay one-half of
one per cent more on new
bonds and to refund old ones
at the new rate would thus
burden the budget with that
additional amount. So far, so
good.
But he should add that he
would recover a very large
part of this $1,250,000,000 in
new taxes. For the additional
interest would go to taxpay-
ers, and it would be added to
their surtaxable income and
be subject to tax.
★
We cannot exactly deter-
mine how much would be re-
covered, but let us consider
the cases of some holders, on
the basis of the tax rates now
asked by the administration.
Some of the bonds would be
held by people with very large
incomes, where the tax "bite"
would be 95%. On the addi-
tional interest paid to these
people, the government would
recover 95 cents on every addi-
tional dollar paid them.
Every corporation with an
income over $25,000 which
held bonds would have to give
back between 55 and 85 cents
on every additional dollar paid
by the Treasury.
Then if the corporation paid
out the remaining 15 to 45
cents that it had left in divi-
dends to its stockholders, Sec-
retary Snyder's tax collector
would grab some additional
tax money. It would be pos-
sible—and an excellent tax ac-
countant, L. Robert Driver,
has carefully calculated these
figures for me—for the Treas-
ury to get back as taxes as
much as 99¼ cents of a dollar
paid to corporations.
★
On the additional interest
paid to smaller individual in-
come tax payers the amount
recovered would vary from
person to person. But on bal-
ance it would be very large.
And so Secretary Snyder's
"alarm" about the cost to the
government if the rate is
raised is either a gross over-
sight or some more of the Tru-
man administration's efforts to
scare us out of our wits. The
increase proposed is a very
sound step toward checking
ruinous inflation—an inflation
for which the Truman admin-
istration is very, very much
to blame.
