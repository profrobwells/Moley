Gov, Dewey has a habit of
using Lincoln's Birthday not
to praise but to attack mem-
bers of his own party. This
year has provided no exсер-
tion. If his vigor in creating
an issue with fellow Republi-
cans had been matched against
Truman in 1948, he might well
have won the Presidency.
Of late Dewey has asserted
his right to speak as the titular
leader of his party. I have no
expert knowledge of how a
titular leader should behave,
never having been a titular
leader of any party or group,
but I have the opinion that a
leader, titular or otherwise,
should seek the broadest pos-
sible area of agreement among
his colleagues. This is appar-
ently not the Dewey conсер-
tion of his duty.
There has developed in the
course of this debate on for-
eign policy definite ground for
the hope that Republican lead-
ers might reach a fairly gen-
eral agreement. There is also
reason to believe that, with
some compromise on both
sides, the two parties in Con-
gress might create an atmos-
phere in which certain funda-
mental principles might be de-
veloped on which the nation
might face a confused world.
The more recent speeches of
Hoover and Taft have shown
an attitude toward Europe and
Asia with which it would not
be difficult to reconcile that
of a number of reasonable
Democrats. A careful compari-
son of the speeches of Sens.
Douglas and Taft shows far
more points of agreement than
disagreement. The whole is-
sue might be reduced to mat-
ters of ways, means and quan-
tities.
Even on the point of the
constitutional powers of the
President and Congress there
could be agreement, with no
real surrender by either side.
Such an attainment of har-
mony in Congress could then
be used to bend the adminis-
tration's course.
The Lincoln Day speech of
Dewey, however, was neither
in tone nor substance a contri-
bution to unity. It reads as if
a new speech writer has been
employed, whose training had
been gained in the Truman
camp in 1948.
It was a "hit the heads you
see" speech in the Donny-
brook tradition. It was, more-
over, the speech of a prose-
cutor determined to win by
extravagance of utterance,
with no weighing of the value
of the opposition's case.
It broadly intimated that
certain unnamed Republicans
wanted to see their country
"shrinking timidly from its
obvious destiny and waiting
for destruction." Dewey, on the
other hand, wants "to see my
country act with courage and
honesty."
This, of course, creates an
issue of black and white, of
cowardice or valor. And
Dewey is with the angels.
He has suggested an Army
of 100 divisions, which consid-
erably exceeds present mili-
tary plans. This is a Dewey
practice. When, a few years
back, President Truman
wanted 100,000 refugees ad-
mitted to Palestine Dewey
raised the bid to something
like seven times that number.
In suggesting that the Pres-
ident should have complete
freedom in "deploying" troops
Dewey casually suggested that
there were 100 precedents.
This is a very reckless use of
precedents and a failure to
make a distinction between
mere "deployment" and the
determination of a vast, new
policy.
The stationing of a very
large army on foreign soil to
operate as a part of a larger
international army for what
may be 10 to 20 years is not
mere "deployment." It in-
volves a grave national deci-
sion which Congress should
authorize in advance and with
complete knowledge of all the
facts and conditions. No doubt,
Congress would authorize
such a move, but the casual
endorsement of a theory that
Congress should not partici-
pate in the decision is a sure
way to hinder the whole oper-
ation.
Dewey has not helped the
cause of constructive action in
defense of Europe by such ex-
travagance. He has impaired
it.
