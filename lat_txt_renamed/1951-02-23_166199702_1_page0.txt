We Must Arm but Still
Guard Against Collapse
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A farsighted businessmen
commented recently, after a
visit to Washington, that it is
not too early to think about
what should be done when,
after a year and a half or two
years and no war intervenes,
we have reached major goals
of production. He added that,
unless such consideration is
given to the future, Russia
may achieve without a war
her main purpose of prostrat-
ing our economy.
Since the mobilization of
our productive effort was sad-
ly neglected for so long, it was
started with an almost hys-
terical jerk. All hands and all
minds were turned to the sup-
plying of war equipment.
The prospect was grim, the
need great and the time short.
With no little confusion,
but with great haste and ener-
gy, the machinery has started
to move. There is a fairly
good prospect that another
miracle of production will
take place. There is plenty of
experience to guide rearma-
ment and there are pieces of
excellent plans. There is also
a vastly greater proportion of
the industrial plant that can
be quickly adapted to war pur-
poses, because only a few
years have passed since it was
used for war production. The
goals set for late 1952 can
probably be reached.
But this mobilization differs
fundamentally from that
which prevailed in the two
world wars. There is no ma-
jor war in progress now to
consume this production as
fast as it is ready. We are, in
fact, preparing not for partici-
pation in a war but for the
prevention of a war. This is
based upon the strong hope
that if we are ready and if we
contribute to the readiness of
our allies, the Soviet will not
dare start a war. What the
Soviet will do is, of course,
unknown. Perhaps the Soviet
leaders do not know.
There is, however, a good
reason to believe that the So-
viet leaders would rather
wreck our economy than en-
gage us in battle. Many Com-
munists have said just that
and all Communist folklore is
based upon the Marxian dog-
ma that capitalism will com-
mit suicide.
We must therefore include
in our calculations the strong
possibility that the Soviet will
watch and waitâ€”perhaps in-
definitely. They will expect the
dream of Marx to come true,
for that is what they have
been taught to expect.
We shall feel much more
secure when we are fully
armed.
But the problem of adjust-
ing our economy to the situa-
tion operating in an armed
country is wholly new and
pregnant with difficulties.
This challenge means that
businesses with large war
production must keep them-
selves in readiness to veer
their course toward civilian
production with no lag in
time. They must maintain
their sales potential. They
must keep their names before
the public. They must give
consideration to research and
to the eternal quest for new
or improved products.
And government must lend
a hand in this preservation of
a stable economy not only by
planning its production needs
intelligently but by giving
fair notice when its quotas
are reaching fulfillment.
There never was a more im-
portant reason for a sympa-
thetic attitude by government
toward business. For if our
economy bogs down the na-
tional security is gravely
threatened.
