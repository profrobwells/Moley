Federal Jobs Up for Sale
as Truman Settles Scores
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A few weeks ago it was duly
noted in the press that State
administrators of price stabili-
zation were being appointed
on the basis of straight party
regularity. Lame ducks and
party officials were on the pre-
ferred list. Republicans and
Dixiecrats were out. And busi-
ness experience and compe-
tence in dealing with this eco-
nomic problem seemed to be
ignored as qualifications.
Now we are beginning to
get the news about what this
sort of thing means when it
gets down to the county level.
In a very serious and dignified
manner the two Senators from
Mississippi, James O. East-
land and John C. Stennis, have
made grave charges of corrup-
tion in their State and have
demanded an investigation.
Neither of these Senators is
a man who makes rash and
unfounded statements. Both
are good lawyers, and Stennis
was a judge for 10 years.
They have stated on the Sen-
ate floor that some time ago
they jointly employed an in-
vestigator to determine the
truth of rumors of jobbery
and that their suspicions have
been verified by facts.
They say that county Office
of Price Stabilization. jobs are
selling at $300 to $100 each;
that prospective government
contractors are being shaken
down, and that postmaster-
ships and rural routes have
been "sold for hard money."
They claim further that the
administration was warned
about what was going on some
time ago, but that nothing was
done.
All this seems to be a by-
product of President Truman's
determination to avenge him-
self for the failure of certain
southern leaders to support
him in 1948. There has been
set up in Mississippi a rump
political organization called
the Mississippi Democratic
Committee to supplant, if pos-
sible, the regular organization
there.
Sen. Eastland says that this
outfit was created by the Dem-
ocratic National Committee.
Presumably, the purpose is to
handle jobs and patronage and
to take over control of the
Mississippi delegation to the
Democratic National Conven-
tion.
Senators and Congressmen
from the State are punished
by denial of patronage. The
two Senators, fearing the sort
of thing that has now hap-
pened, tried to get the admin-
istration in Washington to
take the pains to consult rep-
utable people not under the
ban for Dixiecrat activity
about these jobs and contracts
under the mobilization effort.
This suggestion, too, was ig-
nored.
Thus, we have another piece
of evidence that, despite the
fine words of Charles E. Wil-
son and Eric Johnston, despite
the President's plea for unity
and unselfish devotion, and
despite the grave national
emergency that faces us, vi-
cious political jobbery is still
a major concern of the Fed-
eral administration and of the
Democratic National Commit-
tee.
The echoes of this Missis-
sippi situation will be loud
and lasting, and it may well
be found on investigation that
similar situations prevail in
many other States.
