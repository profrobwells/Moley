These have been taxpaying
days for millions of Americans. And it is probable that a
large proportion, until this
week, never appreciated how
fast the burden has been
growing since the day when
the much abused 80th Congress made the last cut that
we are likely to have for some
time.
It is also probable that, in
the harried hours after we
learned the bad news as we
filled out the tax forms and
anxiously scanned our bank
accounts to see whether we
had the money to pay, we
asked, over and over, what
was happening to our money.
The answer can be stated in
many ways. The war emergency, we all know, bears a
large responsibility. But what
about the other things for
which our government is
spending so much? What is
the welfare state costing us?
One answer can be stated in
a few simple figures from government sources. Let us take
1941 for our basis of calculation, the best year before war
broke upon us. And let us, for
comparison, use the figures of
1941 on a basis of par, or
100%.
First, take the cost of living. With 1941 at 100%, the
comparative figures rose steadily until the end of the war.
Then war costs dropped, of
course, but the cost of living
moved up faster. In 1946 the
cost of living was 132%, or
about one-third over 1911. But
in December, 1950, it was
160%. So much for that phase
of inflation.
But wages have a lot to do
with inflation. In all manufacturing, wages rose from 100%
in 1941 to 215% in 1950. And
more than half of this rise
has been since 1946.
John L. Lewis has done
much better for his workers
than this average. Wages in
bituminous coal mining have
gone from the 100% 1941
level to 252% in 1950.
And while we are scanning
these wage increases, note
this: these increases do not
take into account other benefits such as full employment,
paid vacations, pension plans,
welfare funds and the like.
These add to the cost of production and fall upon the consumer.
Now let us consider the
people who get the earnings
of capital, who are the objects of constant attack by
politicians and others. The
yield of their stocks rose from
the 1941 level only 9%. Compare that 9% with the 115%
increase of wages.
The bondholder has not
gained at all. He has lost. In
1950 his yield was 86% of that
in 1941.
Now let us take a look at
where a lot of the tax money
has been going. In the statistical terminology of the government there is an expression called "transfer payments." This means money
paid out by Federal, State
and local governments for
which no services were performed. It includes money
spent for direct relief, old-age
benefits, unemployment insurance, pensions and other
welfare purposes. Taking
1941 again as a base at 100%,
these payments rose in 1946
to 366%. And in 1950 they were
481%. The total of these payments in 1950 was one and
a half times the entire farm
income of the nation.
That is one way of stating
the cost of the welfare state.
Perhaps in normal times,
with no great armament costs
to meet, we can stand that
nonproductive spending. For
we are a humanitarian nation. But we must realize the
cost.
This is a fact to be remembered by the taxpayer long
after his March aches and
pains have been eased by the
passage of time. When he
hears the glorious promises of
politicians, he must ask himself: "How much welfare can
we afford?"
