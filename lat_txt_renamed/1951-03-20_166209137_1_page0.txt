INTERLUDE
OF CALM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Now, with more than half
of March gone, the time has
arrived when, according to
some American commentators,
war was to break in the Bal-
kans. In fact, a few commen-
tators have gone over there to
see the beginning of the third
world war. If they look sharp-
ly, they will see some shoot-
ing. There is always feuding
along the Albanian and Greek
borders at this time of year.
But no war has yet broken out.
Despite alarms, rumors and
unquestioned dangers, there
seems to have settled over the
American people a pronounced
reaction.

This may be a very foolish
and dangerous attitude. The
danger to our interests, except
in Korea, is no more remote
than it was six months ago.
Certainly, since the President
issued his vast estimates of
future spending, the danger
to our economic structure is
even greater.

Perhaps our suddenly com-
placent mood is due to no
change in conditions at all, but
is the result of psychological
letdown. Since we are all acute-
ly aware, because of experi-
ence, of the conditions induced
by a big war, we are inca-
pable of stiffening ourselves
against the mere threat of a
big war.

But some of this reaction is
due to the lack of confidence
in the very people who pro-
claimed the emergency and
frightened us into a spirit of
action a few months ago. The
administration simply does not
look like or act like a leader-
ship that expects anything se-
rious to happen.

The President stubbornly
maintains in office Secretary
Acheson and the State De-
partment group that opened
the way to the great Chinese
disaster.

The people in and around
the RFC who played politics
with precious public funds
while we were squeezed with
emergency taxation are still
there. Gen. Marshall's forget-
fulness and lack of old-time
energy are not inspiring. And
no one can take the war
mobilization people seriously
while politics is played as
usual in price stabilization
and in negotiations with labor
leaders.

What are we to think and
feel when our leaders fail to
lead? When there is no leader-
ship, the people languish.

There is, moreover, a creep-
ing suspicion that, despite our
continuing losses, the Chinese
in Korea never had the po-
tential strength that was once
announced.

Some economic facts may be
emerging from this changed
mood. The rush to buy seems
to have stopped. Food prices
are no longer rising. Grain
prices are easing. Vegetables,
perhaps seasonably, are low-
er. Meat will become more
plentiful.

Businessmen's inventories,
greatly increased after Ko-
rea, are high. They are becom-
ing a burdensome embarrass-
ment in some lines, such as
in appliances, textiles, leather
goods and finished cotton
goods.

Perhaps all this is a lull be-
fore another storm, but here
it is.
