DOLLARS
IN FLIGHT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

SAN ANTONIO — In this
city, which might be called
the major gateway to Mexico,
conditions in our neighbor na-
tion are closely watched and
clearly understood. At the mo-
ment, Mexican economic con-
ditions take on a rosy hue.
And strangely enough, that
nation, once believed to be on
the verge of Socialism, has
become the sanctuary for
frightened American capital.
All over the United States
our own people have become
increasingly conscious of dan-
gerous inflation, the threat of
more inflation, higher taxes,
low interest rates, and the con-
sequent fear for the security
of savings and risk capital.
Evidence of that fear can
easily be found in the beha-
vior of movable money. The
flight to Mexico is high on
the list of such portents,

The dollar reserves of the
Bank of Mexico have been ris-
ing at a rapid rate for many
months. This is a measure of
the movement of money into
Mexico.

It was estimated that in the
six months after Korea 250,-
000,000 American dollars
found their way into that coun-
try. Part of this, of course,
was in money spent by a rising
tide of tourists, and part was
for the purchase of raw mate-
rials.
But the greater proportion
was in money sent in for in-
vestment. Some of this went
directly into new industries,
but most of it went into com-
mon industrial stocks. Only a
small part went into mining.
These stocks have gone up
in money volume 30 to 35%
since Korea.
Meanwhile, a normal offset
to this trend, Mexican buying
in the United States, has de-
clined, largely because of the
rise in prices here.
There are many obvious rea-
sons for this movement of
money to Mexico. The Mexi-
can tax rate is only about one-
third of that in the United
States. Under President Ale-
man there has been growing
confidence in the conservative
character of the Mexican gov-
ernment, especially in its fis-
cal policies under Treasury
Minister Ramon Beteta, who
seems to know what he is do-
ing.

As the reserves of the Bank
of Mexico have been rising,
Beteta has been converting
traditional silver and Amer-
ican dollars into gold. Clearly,
this shows a belief that Amer-
ican dollars are not what they
used to be.
All this is a strange rever-
sal of history. Not so many
years ago Mexico was believed
in the United States to be
moving toward a leftist revolu-
tion. The vast labor move-
ment was regarded as an ir-
resistible force for Socialism,
if not Communism.
And now capital from what
the Communists regard as the
heart of capitalism—the Unit-
ed States—is running to the
relative security of Mexico,
