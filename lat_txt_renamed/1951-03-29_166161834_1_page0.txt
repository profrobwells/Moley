SAN ANTONIO—Only one
American can truthfully be
described as a man who can
prove that he would rather
be right than President. He
is living peacefully in Uvalde,
Tex., keenly appraising the
turn of national events, but
offering no advice to those
who are attempting to guide
them.
There can be no question
about the fact that John
Nance Garner could have
been President. In 1940 the
nod of his head would have
assured him renomination for
Vice-President, A Democratic
convention that took Henry
Wallace with bitter reluctance
would have named Garner,
whether Roosevelt wanted
him or not.
He says now that if he had
become President when
Roosevelt died, he would not
be living now, But that is a
point about which, after a
visit with him on this trip, I
should be inclined to disagree.
In 1940, however, Garner
made his decision not to run,
on the principle that no President or Vice-President ought
to serve more than two terms,
His understanding after the
1938 election was that Roosevelt shared that conviction,
but he learned later that convictions based upon principle
were not heavily weighed on
the President's scale of values.
In any event, Garner—who
in person is "Mr. Garner" to
everyone, even to his son—
parted company with his two-
time running mate and returned to Uvalde immediately
after the inauguration in
1941.
He has watched the slow
course of the 22nd Amend-
ment through the nation's
Legislatures with deep concern.
People who adored the late
President hesitated to admit
that he had ever been wrong.
But in Texas, as well as elsewhere, the myth of Roosevelt's infallibility is dying.
Finally, this year the Texas
Legislature acted favorably.
That there was a well-directed
but unpublicized nudge from
Uvalde cannot be doubted, although the elder statesman
will not admit it.
Garner is, however, quite
willing to express his approval of the limitation of the
tenure of the President. It
will have a very wholesome
effect upon our entire political life.
There can never be much
doubt about any President's
renomination. His job holders will see to that. But after the first four years there
can be a vote of confidence in
him and if he is not satisfactory, the voters can put him
out.
After the second election
the President's power over
his party will decline. Prospective successors will appear
and be considered and tested.
The field will be open. And
the net result will be vastly
more healthy party life and
more of a chance to hold elections without the domination
of a Federal machine.
For these and many other
reasons the 22nd Amendment,
now the law of the land, is a
healthy sign of the survival
of sound principle. And Garner as well as many other
Democrats believed in that
principle long before the voters were able to appreciate it.
