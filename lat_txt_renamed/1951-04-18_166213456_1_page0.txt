Everything Is Fine If
You Don't Look Closely
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In an excellent new book,
"The New Welfare State," a
talented, practical economist,
Jules Abels, points out how
implicitly the advocates of the
welfare state depend upon ap-
pearances rather than reali-
ties. "The business outlook,"
said the Assistant Secretary of
Commerce a while ago, "is
what you make it."
Mr. Abels calls this method
to which our government econ-
omists are so addicted "pros-
perity by Coueism." Since Dr.
Emile Coue predated the New
Deal by some years, it may be
well to tell younger readers
that he was a famous French
psychotherapeutist who ad-
vised his patients to say inces-
santly to themselves: "Day by
day in every way I am becom-
ing better and better."
*
Perhaps the great depres-
sion, in which bitter realities
broke in upon the self-decep-
tions of people, did something
to end the Coue influence. But
in another form it still is the
guiding spirit of the national
administration.
Abels describes several
methods by which government
politicians and politician-econ-
omists try to bring about a
state of euphoria. First, there
is what Abels calls "the horta-
tory technique."
That has been very promi-
nent in President Truman's
speeches. Vast, glittering pic-
tures are drawn of a future of
dynamic progress. What does
it matter, Truman says in sub-
stance, if we scatter a few bil-
lion in handouts? It will all
come back in unbounded prog-
ress and a boundless national
income.
*
Another method Abels calls
"protective caress." This con-
sists of occasional sweet words
for business, while in the next
breath a demand is made for
a hike in corporation taxes.
Leon Keyserling, the Presi-
dent's chief economic adviser,
is a master at this method.
Then there is the "gadfly
technique." Business is re-
minded that if it does not get
better and better, something
awful will happen. The steel
industry is told that if it will
not build more and more facili-
ties, the government will do
so.
For the beneficiaries of hand-
outs, there is, of course,
a tremendously intoxicating
brew. Just vote right and per-
fect lifelong security will be
the reward.
*
Then there is the deluding
economic doctrine common to
both government and labor-
union economists, the mass
purchasing power idea. We are
told that it is much better to
raise the lower incomes than
those higher up, because poor-
er people spend more than
richer people. Hence, every
wage increase not only helps
the recipients but the econom-
ic system as a whole.
Finally, there is the resort
to inflationary scares and to
inflation itself. The bureaucrat
is just as happy to scare peo-
ple by warnings about infla-
tion as he is to see inflation
itself. For the scare produces
the reality. And since people
fail to calculate the loss in
purchasing power as rapidly
as the loss takes place, the
politician is always ahead of
the game.

Americans should be ready
to anticipate plenty of appli-
cation of Coueism in the next
few months. It is now likely
that the spring and summer
months will show some decline
in prices.
The administration will use
this to warn, threaten and ca-
jole Congress into voting for
the welfare items in the budg-
et. For the cry then will not
be the emergency or defense,
but the danger of deflation.
In the administration's book,
nothing must stop the flow of
spending.
Boethius offered a maxim
which might be considered as
a motto to be inscribed on
the stone face of the Treas-
ury: "Nothing is miserable but
what is thought so; every es-
tate is happy if he that bear-
it be content."
