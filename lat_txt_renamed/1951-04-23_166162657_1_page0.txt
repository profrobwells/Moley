Germany Does Well,
Say Private Sources
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the midst of confusion,
conflict and discouraging news
from Europe, it is pleasant to
note. some encouraging facts
and conclusions about Ger-
man recovery and fighting po-
tential.
This information comes from
excellent private sources, com-
municated to important for-
mer German citizens now liv-
ing in this country. It is un-
tainted by official propaganda
and diplomatic maneuvering
and double talk.
It is not the same sort of
story that German journalists
and officials give to Americans
for the purpose of serving
German interests in this coun-
try and to elicit from us vast
new grants of material and
military aid. But it is true.

The state of German recov-
ery is far ahead of that of
Britain. The food is less ra-
tioned and is much better.
Visitors in Switzerland say
that half of the good automo-
biles are of German make. The
misery of the first postwar
years is gone and self-confi-
dence is growing in every way.
In the iron and steel indus-
try the enormous technical
superiority of German engi-
neers and organizers is al-
ready evident and in the op-
eration of the Schuman plan
the Germans are sure to play
the first fiddle. In the coming
collaboration in agriculture the
same will be the case.

The Germans of course were
compelled to surrender their
merchant fleet to the allies
after the war. But they are
now prepared to build another
with what, they hope, will be
loans from the United States.
Western German Economic
Minister Ehrhardt is prepar-
ing to come over here to see
what he can do about that.
Whatever German officials
may say for purpose of propa-
ganda, Western Germany is
prepared to fight. It cannot
endure the prospect of the
certain destruction of its Ruhr
industry by our air power in
case of Soviet attack.
Private sources of informa-
tion, mareover, indicate that
in planning the military de-
fense of Europe, the West Ger-
mans would like to put the
eastern line of defense further
east than American strategy
would have it. They would
establish that line along ten-
able natural defenses, east
of Hamburg through middle
Germany, over Frankfurt, then
it might perhaps go to the old
French Maginot Line and down
to the Alps and the Mediter-
ranean.

The most heartening of all
this information concerns the
East Germans, The Soviet
has made a great propaganda
gesture of the "progress" that
Communist infiltration has
made in that region, A great
hullabaloo has been created
over the organization of some
hundred thousand German
youngsters in a Red front.
But it will take more than a
forced and clumsy mobiliza-
tion by the Soviet to overcome
the hatred and fear of Rus-
sians that have existed there
for centuries. That hatred has
been sharpened by brutal
treatment since the war. Any
mobilization of East Germans
against the West Germans is
unthinkable and the Soviet un-
doubtedly knows that.
*
The fact is that if a free
vote were allowed in the Rus-
sian sector, including East
Berlin, 95% of East Germans
would go anti-Communist,
Moreover, there is a well-
defined underground move-
ment of Germans operating in
Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The prospect of such a danger
behind its lines is not an as-
sured deterrent to Soviet plans
for an attack upon the west,
but it is a very serious factor.
What is needed is a resolute
effort by the American gov-
ernment to overcome British
and French reluctance to arm
the Germans, for they not on-
ly are ready to fight but also
are indispensable to our cause.
