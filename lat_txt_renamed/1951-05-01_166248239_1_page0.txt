JACKSON, Miss.—It is a
political axiom, verified by his-
tory, that sections with simi-
lar economic interests will, ul-
timately have common politi-
cal sympathies.
For that reason the great
economic revival that is going
on all over the South, and no-
tably here in Mississippi, of-
fers the best hope that a na-
tional coalition party will ulti-
mately grow out of the con-
servative elements in the Dem-
ocratic Party in the South
and a large part of the Re-
publican Party of the North.
This will depend upon the
capacity of Republicans to
note the ominous handwrit-
ing on the wall and transform
their policies and name to
make a true coalition possi-
ble. This will not take the
form of enlisting Southern
Democrats in the Republican
Party, but it would come
through mutual concessions
based on common interests.

Mississippi offers a magnifi-
cent example of how rapidly
the differences between the
economic civilizations of the
North and South are vanish-
ing. The time is approaching
when it will be difficult to dis-
tinguish Southern States such
as this economically from such
Northern States as Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio.
The days of a South con-
signed to an almost exclusive
agricultural economy passed
some time ago. Now its agri-
culture is rapidly moving
away from the old one-crop,
cotton era and entering a pe-
riod when it will be raising
the same products as Iowa
and Nebraska.
The cattle industry is grow-
ing by leaps and bounds. The
advantages for this form of
agriculture are obvious. Long
grazing seasons of 10 months
lighten the burden of housing
and feeding. Lush vegetation,
artesian wells and cheaper
land are other advantages.
And it may be added that
there is presently a tax ad-
vantage in cattle raising. Cat-
tle raisers are moving into
Mississippi from Kansas, Iowa,
Texas, California and Canada.
It is reliably estimated that
the value of cattle and poul-
try output is almost up to that
of cotton and would have
passed it except for war
prices and more cotton acre-
age this year.

In the delta country along
the Mississippi River more
corn, oats, and rice are being
raised. Some of this soil is
the richest in the world, since
it has received top soil from
States to the north which per-
mitted the impoverishment of
their land by the elements.
As in other Southern States,
industry is moving in at a
great rate. There are lower
taxes, abundant labor supply,
and, what is very important,
conservative State and local
governments not yet dominat-
ed by the political arms of or-
ganized labor.
The pulp industry is devel-
oping very fast. There is oil,
too, and some natural gas.
The immense Negro popula-
tion is progressing economi-
cally and in other ways. Farm
ownership by Negroes has
multiplied manyfold in 10
years.
As one man said today: "Mis-
sissippi isn't finished yet. It
is just beginning. And it is
free enterprise and individual
energy that is making this
true."
The political outcome of
this is clear. More and more
the political interests of the
South will, to use a MacAr-
thur word, "mesh" with those
of the North. In the face of
these economic facts, there is
no common sense in keeping
alive ancient rivalries, politi-
cal distrust and party divi-
sion.
