CONFUSION
IN COTTON
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
NEW ORLEANS—The fit-
ful, capricious policies of our
many-headed government are
well illustrated this year in
the cotton business. At the
moment, resentment is rising
among producers of that com-
modity much like that recent-
ly reported in the meat busi-
ness.
It is an old, twice-told story
that restrictions on cotton
raising in the early Roose-
velt years brought into be-
ing a great expansion of cot-
ton raising abroad. That re-
sulted in a long series of com-
plications, the end of which
may never be reached.
The events of the past year
illustrate the tangled web
that is woven when govern-
ment attempts to take mat-
ters out of the hands of a free
market.
After the outbreak of the
Korean war, the price of raw
cotton on the farm started to
rise. It was approximately 30
cents a pound in June, 1950,
and more than 41 cents in
January of this year.
Alarmed at the prospect of
a domestic shortage, the gov-
ernment last fall placed a re-
striction on exports, a cut
from 6,000,000 bales last year
to 4,000,000 for 1951.
This caused a rise in the
price of Brazilian cotton. It
rose 30 cents a pound higher
than American cotton at one
time and now stands at about
20 cents higher. That means
that a Brazilian producer gets
$100 to $125 more for a bale
than does an American.
Secretary Brannan in the
fall also exhorted farmers to
plant enough cotton this
spring to produce 16,000,000
bales. Domestic consumption
will be about 10,600,000 bales.
But no one can estimate how
much will be raised by in-
creased acreage. And until the
reports on planting are pub-
lished in July, that will re-
main a mystery.
However, despite the advice
and protests of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, the Eco-
nomic Stabilization Agency
has slapped a ceiling on cot-
ton prices. And to make the
confusion still greater, there is
now a threat of rollbacks.
While the effect of this on
the farmer is serious, it is pro-
ducing even greater trouble in
the complex and delicate sys-
tem of financing and distribut-
ing cotton.
Millions of dollars have
been advanced on the assump-
tion of a stable ceiling price
for cotton. Contracts have
been made for the delivery of
cotton at the ceiling price—cot-
ton that has not yet been
grown. Chaos would result
from any rollback that failed
to take these loans and for-
ward delivery contracts into
account.
E. F. Creekmore, president
of the Cotton Exchange here
in New Orleans, says: "Roll-
backs constitute the greatest
possible danger to cotton mer-
chants. There are disturbing
elements in President Tru-
man's message; however, it is
inconceivable that he would
consider an action that could
undermine the entire agricul-
tural economy."
All this shows how difficult
it is for any government to fix
prices and guarantee incomes.
But this difficulty is infinitely
greater when one arm of the
government is unable to co-
ordinate its efforts with an-
other. There will be plenty of
uproar in Congress before cot-
ton-picking time.
