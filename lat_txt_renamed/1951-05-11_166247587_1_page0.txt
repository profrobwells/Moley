MacArthur Has Forced
Retreat to a New Line
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
To adopt one of the military
terms to which we are becom-
ing accustomed, the MacArthur
attack has caused his opposi-
tion to retreat to new but not
well-prepared positions.
There was never a better ex-
ample of what public opinion
can do if it is sufficiently
strong and vociferous. Even as
stubborn a spirit as Truman's
and as outwardly calm a self-
assurance as Acheson's must
give plenty of ground in such
a case as this.
We are now assured that
measures are being taken to
ready Chiang's army for the
contingency of action some-
where, if not in Korea. The
notion of abandoning or trad-
ing off Formosa, once enter-
tained in high circles, is as
dead as the dinosaur.
Administration supporters
consider at least reconnais-
sance over enemy bases in
Manchuria if the present mili-
tary situation turns to the
worse. And official opinion is
veering toward unilateral ac-
tion to stop our so-called allies
from trading with the Chinese
Reds.
This looks very much like
the acceptance in part of all of
MacArthur's four prescrip-
tions. Perhaps that is all that
could have been expected. And
it must be conceded by all that
MacArthur's return, his recep-
tion by the public, and his tes-
timony before the Senate com-
mittees have brought this
about. MacArthur has thereby
performed a great service.
This cracking of the line of
bitter opposition is most no-
table among members of Con-
gress who are closer to the
electorate and more sensitive
to public opinion than is the
administration. It appears also
in the opinions of newspapers
which have been more or less
favorable to the administra-
tion's foreign policy.

The New York Times finally
realizes that the United Na-
tions in its dilatory tactics to-
ward taking any action de-
signed to stop the pouring in
of supplies through Chinese
ports is. in effect contributing
to the defeat of its own de-
clared purpose of stopping ag-
gression in Korea.
The niggling jabs at Mac-
Arthur by the President are
evidences of badly shaken self-
confidence. If, as the President
has said more than once and
his supporters many, many
times, MacArthur made a
wrong guess about Chinese in-
tervention, there is opened a
wide avenue of counterattack.
For the whole foreign policy
of the administration has been
marked by a series of bad
guesses.
The surreptitious release of
the so-called record of the Tru-
man-MacArthur conference at
Wake Island suggested the
cheap tactics of a befouled
campaign for Alderman or
County Sheriff. That sort of
stuff doesn't belong in this sort
of debate. It has backfired bad-
ly.
*
And the miserable admis-
sion of the hiding of a stenog-
rapher behind a door, "auto-
matically" taking notes, has
suffused the "revelation" with
banal comedy. It seems that at
Wake no one was asleep.
Meanwhile, the tide of pub-
lic opinion remains over-
whelmingly critical of the ad-
ministration.
The tide of battle in Korea
may change this situation, but
it can hardly wipe out the
memory of the long record of
fumbling with the vital securi-
ty of the country.
