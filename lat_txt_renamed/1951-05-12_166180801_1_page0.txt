This Report on Crime
Puts Nation to Shame
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It would be very easy to
comment on the excellent re-
port of Sen. Kefauver's com-
mittee in cynical terms. Its
wealth of detail and its many
conclusions and recommen-
dations are not new mate-
rial. The patterns of crime
change very little, and the
remedies are obvious.
*
But this report and the in-
vestigation which preceded it
were valuable contributions to
the public interest. It is well
to have these activities, of
which most of us are well
aware, spread out in detail
with names, dates, and places.
The presence in this en-
lightened and wealthy coun-
try of an illicit industry with
profits of billions and peopled
by unprincipled scoundrels is
a disgraceful reflection upon
all of us. If this broad land
were poor and illiterate we
might expect it to be in-
fested with lawless bands of
thieves and murderers. That
is what uncivilized countries
have had—and no wonder.
*
But here we are, rich
enough to spend billions on
government, on education
and law enforcement; en-
lightened enough to have the
feeling of holding the torch
in a dark world; strong
enough to conquer continents
and seas; a nation of essential-
ly decent, kindly people—
here we are, living cheek by
jowl with a larcenous crew
of mobsters and corruption-
ists.
These people bribe and out-
wit the people we put in office
to protect us; take our money
with tricks and toys that we
know are crooked; live un-
ashamed in our hotels; hang
around our public offices, Leg-
islatures and courts; boss the
people who control elections.
From what the report says,
a good many shady characters
found it easier to see Bill
O’Dwyer, Mayor of New York,
than did the principals of
schools where our children are
taught morals and good gov-
ernment.
Over the nation there is
plenty of money to buy votes
by handouts but not enough
to stop illegal interstate trade
in crooked, gambling devices.
The Federal government has
found power and time to
harass many businesses, but it
hasn’t been able to prevent a
telegraph company from act-
ing as a medium of communi-
cation for illegal betting.
*
The government squeezes
the last cent of taxes from
honest people, but “huge sums
in cash handled by racketeers
are not reflected in the in-
come tax returns.”
A responsibility falls upon
the Federal government to cor-
rect these Federal matters.
The Kefauver report spells
them out.
Our wretched law enforce-
ment in many States is re-
vealed. It is up to State Legis-
latures and Governors to bring
law enforcement in the coun-
ties up to the standard of some
of the good cities. That can be
done by enlarging the powers
and facilities of the State po-
lice systems and reducing
Sheriffs to the homely tasks of
process servers and jail tend-
ers.
It is now up to the press to
take on some of its crusad-
ing zeal of old.
*
It is up to the profession of
the bar to drive out of its
ranks the lawyers whose pres-
ent occupation is to keep these
crooks out of trouble.
And it is up to the public-
spirited citizens in many cities
to create crime commissions to
watch and support law-en-
forcement officers. The Kefau-
ver report is right in saying
that “crime is largely a local
problem.”
