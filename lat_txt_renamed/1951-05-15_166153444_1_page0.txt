Exports to China Laid
to Attlee and Not Britain
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After noting the answers
made by President Truman
and Secretary Marshall to the
MacArthur demand that Brit-
ish shipments to the Red Chi-
nese be stopped, we have a
right to wonder whether it is
Britain herself or the Labor
government thereof that our
administration regards as an
ally.
For we are told by them
that to take steps to stop those
outrageous and indefensible
shipments would lose us our
"allies."
The fact is that the British
Conservatives are as angry
about such shipments as is
our Republican Party. It may
result in another vote of con-
fidence and the downfall of
Attlee. Hence, it may be well
for us to confine our indigna-
tion to the British government
and withhold our condemna-
tion of the British nation.
The debate in Parliament on
this subject has been very bit-
ter. Under the heavy fire of
Churchill, Eden and others,
the president of the Board of
Trade was forced to disclose
that British exports to China
for the first quarter of 1951
were four times as great as in
the first quarter of 1950. This,
of course, included great quan-
tities of rubber and other es-
sential war materials.

Emanuel Shinwell, Attlee's
strange selection as Minister
of Defense, was first chal-
lenged by Conservatives. This
man, who is supposed to be
the directing genius of Brit-
ain's meager help to us on the
bloody field of Korea, claimed
that he was unable to answer,
but that "the government had
taken a decision some time ago
to prevent, so far as practica-
able, the export of strategic
materials to China."
He was then confronted
with the reports of the presi-
dent of the Board of Trade.
Weakly, Shinwell answered
that "no aircraft" had been ex-
ported. He could not deny the
export of rubber, locomotives
and ships. Then Eden demand-
ed that the government pub-
lish what it considered to be
strategic raw materials.
At this point it should be
noted that MacArthur was
able to name them in his testi-
mony without any hesitation
at all. But Shinwell said that
he was not prepared to com-
mit himself.
*
Then the Olympian Church-
ill arose and contemptously
said:
"You don't know anything
about it at all."
The report of the debate con-
cludes by saying that Shin-
well's answer was "lost in the
uproar" that followed.
A day later the Prime Min-
ister came to the rescue with
a lot of double talk about how
the United Kingdom's so-
called "licensing" of trade
with China was working. To
an American, as well as to his
Parliamentary opposition, his
explanation was wholly with-
out meaning.
So much so that when an
exasperated Eden demanded
the figures on rubber exports
to China Attlee weakly re-
ferred the matter back to the
president of the Board of
Trade.
It deserves to be added that
on that same day those figures
appeared in the London Times.
That an American blockade
is essential to stop this trad-
ing with the enemy goes with-
out saying. The best answer to
what Britain would do in such
a case was made to me at a
meeting in New York 10 weeks
ago. Before a large audience
I asked an important British
official what his government
would do if we blockaded the
Chinese ports.
He replied: "We couldn't do
a (blank) thing."
