EVERYONE'S
ANXIOUS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems odd to note that
the stock market and Presi-
dent Truman are manifest-
ing erratic behavior these
days and that the same fac-
tor is largely responsible 'in
both cases.
The President, of course, is
acting as he has for a long,
long time, and the market
seems to be responding to
some impulse that is quite
immediate.
Both, however, must be in-
fluenced by the plain fact that
in the very near future the
fighting in Korea is going to
tell us a great many things
that we do not and cannot
know now. The answers to
many of our economic and
political problems will be
written over there in the for-
tunes of war.
There is this difference. The
stock market reflects the cau-
tion of people who are trying
to protect themselves. The
President apparently feels
that he has already lost so
much that nothing he can say
will help much and that the
fighting will make the deci-
sions anyway.
Manufacturers are wonder-
ing what will happen to their
defense orders if peace comes
in Korea or if a decisive mili-
tary victory occurs. Business
is worried also by the fact
that everybody seems to be
loaded with inventories of
civilian goods.
Congress is marking time,
waiting to see what happens.
If the fighting in Korea ends
or the prospects of victory
brighten, Congress is not like-
ly to renew most of the con-
trols legislation which is due
to expire soon.
The President presumably
continues to hope for the best.
He has already yielded about
half of what MacArthur de-
manded. But instead of quiet-
ing down and thus permitting
the MacArthur controversy to
fade away, he lights up the
fires with his ineptitude.
*
He must realize now what
he proved by his statement
that he was considering the
general's removal a year ago.
It explains—and the meaning
is not lost by the hasty White
House correction—why he did
not consult MacArthur about
entering the war in Korea a
year ago.
In short, he decided to start
a war and to dump it without
warning into the lap of a gen-
eral in whom he had no confi-
dence.
Meanwhile, because Mar-
shall shifted so much responsi-
bility to the State Department,
every knife in Congress is be-
ing whetted for the Secretary
of State.
Despite his jaunty behavior,
the President must feel as did
Wellington when the sun was
low in the west at Waterloo.
"Blucher or night," said the
Iron Duke.
