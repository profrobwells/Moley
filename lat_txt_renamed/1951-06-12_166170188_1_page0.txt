BANKRUPT'S
PROGRESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Senate has now author-
ized, by a vote of 50 to 28, the
gigantic Central Arizona Proj-
ect. As was noted in this col-
umn three weeks ago, this
project involves the building
of a dam on the Colorado Riv-
er above Hoover Dam and vast
power and irrigation pumps
and conduits to carry water
to Lower Central Arizona.
The present estimate of
cost, increased since last year
by $80,000,000, is $788,000,000.
The House committee has
bottled up an identical bill,
HR 1500, by a 3-to-1 vote. The
building of this great proj-
ect cannot under the terms of
the bill start while present
emergency controls on prices
and materials prevail. And it
must wait until the Supreme
Court has decided that Arizona
has a right to the water, Cali-
fornia and Nevada deny that
right. But by the Senate vote,
in which there is much evi-
dence of old-fashioned logroll-
ing among Senators, the proj-
ect has passed its first stage.
Two aspects of this action
should provide doubt and ap-
prehension to taxpayers in the
45 States which are not in-
volved in this controversy. The
first is the heavy burden of
paying for such an enterprise
placed on this and the next
generation.

For the beneficiaries are rel-
atively few in number. The
Bureau of Reclamation esti-
mates that 6000 farms will
benefit directly. Proponents of
the scheme estimate that 30,-
000 farmers will benefit direct-
ly or indirectly.
The other aspect of this ac-
tion is the wide departure
from the original principles
that governed reclamation
projects back in the days of
Theodore Roosevelt, when the
first great Arizona project, the
Roosevelt Dam, was con-
structed.
In those remote days it was
a principle of the reclama-
tion law that farmers using
the water should repay the
costs. The Hoover Dam is
paying and will repay, dollar
for dollar.
But that principle is ap-
parently no longer in fashion.
When the Hoover Dam was
built the yardstick of repay-
ment by water and power
users was 50 years. This Ari-
zona project moves the period
up to something between 73
and 100 years.
In the future, under this
new principle, we may expect
reclamation and power proj-
ects to be, in effect, vast en-
terprises in subsidizing agri-
culture at the expense of the
generality of taxpayers. In
short, this is another long
step toward the welfare state
and the inflation, expropria-
tion and bankruptcy that such
a state will involve.
