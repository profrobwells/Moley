ON FREEING
OUR VOICE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Whatever the journalistic
supporters of Secretary Ache-
son may say of his clever tes-
timony, it is already clear that
he made a number of state-
ments which, in the light of
other testimony and revealed
facts, were serious mistakes of
judgment.
Also, the record of his de-
partment, for which he can
hardly escape responsibility, is
deplorable. An overwhelming
majority of Americans have
lost confidence in the State De-
partment, and there must fol-
low from this a general disbe-
lief in what the department
says. It is ridiculous there-
fore to call the voice of the
State Department the Voice of
America. This lack of confi-
dence at home is exactly what
the Soviet will use to discredit
all propaganda from that
source.
*
The Formosa memorandum
which advised American diplo-
matic representatives to dis-
count the possible loss of that
island was, as Acheson con-
fessed, not a true statement of
the department's position. It
was designed to save face if
Formosa fell.
Such a false expression of
American interests as this
would be binding on the Voice
of America, which is an organ
of the State Department.
The voice of truth should
seek a new home. It should
not be in the Central Intelli-
gence Agency either, for that
agency must be concerned in
directing "psychological war-
fare," which we hope is the
energizing of the underground
in Russia and the satellites
with something more deadly
than talk over the radio.
The Voice of America should
be an independent agency re-
sponsible only to the Presi-
dent. It should have some tie
with the Central Intelligence
Agency to avoid working at
cross-purposes. And it should
have some contact with the
State and Defense Depart-
ments. But it should be sub-
ject to none of these depart-
ments.

The forerunner of the Voice
of America, the OWI, in the
war was rendered ineffective
in' undermining the morale of
Germany and Japan because it
was bound by such top-level
decisions as "unconditional
surrender" and the Morgen-
thau plan.
Its directing heads were not
free because these policies—
we now know how wrong they
were—were the basis of all
propaganda. In short, the
more we talked to the people
of the enemy countries, the
more determined they were to
fight to the end. Something of
the sort is likely to be true of
the present broadcasting of the
policies of the State Depart-
ment.
