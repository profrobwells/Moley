Eccles' Theory on Why
Truman Discharged Him
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Marriner Eccles, former
chairman of the Federal Re-
serve Board, apparently has
not learned two of the cardinal
principles of politics. His book
of reminiscences, "Beckoning
Frontiers," proves this in con-
vincing fashion.
I was told of the first of
those political principles by
Jimmy Walker, once Mayor of
New York, who in turn learned
it from Charles Murphy,
shrewdest boss in Tammany's
history. Walker said that when
Murphy had to announce the
unpleasant news to a hopeful
candidate that his ambition
was not to be realized he never
gave a reason.
His reason for this omission
was that he wanted to save
the feelings of the disappoint-
ed man. Hurt feelings, he be-
lieved, would be salvaged by
the ego of the person con-
cerned. He would invent his
own reasons which would not
injure his self-esteem.
Eccles has done this by
ascribing his removal from
the chairmanship of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board to the in-
fluence of the Bank of America
and the Transamerica Corp.,
whose expansion he had
vigorously opposed.
★
He pieces together a cir-
cumstantial case. There were
friendships between Secretary
of the Treasury Snyder and
officers of the bank and there
was the possible influence of
the bank in California, which
Truman hoped to carry in 1948.
No direct evidence is offered.
Against this theory is the fact
that Truman has repeatedly
shown himself to be inflexible
in his support of his officials
when they are under attack.
There is also the fact that the
Bank of America had for a
long time been at odds with
the Truman administration, as
it had been with that of
Roosevelt.
To prove his case Eccles
would have to show that the
bank was really in a position
to exercise political power and
that would be difficult if not
impossible.
There were much more
plausible reasons to which we
may attribute the Truman de-
cision. Eccles has many excel-
lent qualities, but among them
the capacity to get on with
people is lacking. He had no
serious differences with Roose-
velt, because he agreed with
Roosevelt's spending policies.
He also agreed, very un-
wisely, I believe, that the
chairman of the Federal Re-
serve could be removed at the
will or caprice of the Presi-
dent. He lived to feel the bit-
ter force of this surrender of
principle.

Eccles irritated a great many
people in Roosevelt's first two
terms. To be perfectly frank
about it, his talking had no
terminal facilities. He is a
smart person and he gave peo-
ple the impression that he was
quite aware of his gifts. No
doubt the political crowd
around Truman, perhaps the
President himself, resented
this.
The second political lesson
that Eccles had apparently not
learned is that while poli-
ticians like Roosevelt were
quite willing to seize the
Keynes-Eccles rationalization
of spending to end a depres-
sion they will never take the
further extension of that doc-
trine to stop spending in an
inflation.
Eccles was quite logical in
this and made no secret of
his opposition to the inflation-
ary policies of the Truman
regime. Surely the Eccles ene-
mies would vigorously remind
the President of this. Here
Eccles was striking at the
vitals of the Fair Deal. He
could not have expected the
President to sustain such
"heresy." For such a sin
even angels must fall.
