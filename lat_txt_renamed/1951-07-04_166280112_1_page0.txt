'But 'Twas
a Famous
Victory'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The anniversary of the war
In Korea and the negotiation
to end it brought forth from
administration apologists
some strange substitutes for
victory. They could not an-
swer little Peterkin's ques-
tion in Southey's poem: "But
what good came of it?" ex-
cept, as old Casper did:
"Why, that I cannot tell,"
said he:
"But 'twas a famous victory."
That answer seems to be
enough for Acheson.
One way in which the claim
of victory is explained has
been to say that Russia might
have made an attack some-
where else, except for the
Korean war. This is the weak-
est of all the claims, because
if the Soviet had wanted to
attack it would have had a
greater advantage while we
were so heavily committed in
Korea.
*
We also hear the refrain
that followed Pearl Harbor.
Then it was said by some who
had agitated for war through-
out 1940 and 1941 that, great
as our loss was on the fatal
December day, it was worth
it because it aroused the
American people.
Now it is said that "we"—
that is, I suppose, Mr. Tru-
man—were moved after the
Korean war began to expand
our armed strength, and now
we are much stronger. Behind
that claim is the everlasting
excuse of those at the head of
our affairs that the American
people had to be stirred be-
fore the administration could
do its duty.
This nonsense deserves a
sharp answer. It was not the
fault of the American people
that our defensive force was
permitted to fade away.

The American people had
nothing to do with our with-
drawal from South Korea and
our failure to give South Korea
military aid after Congress had
authorized it. That was the
failure of the President and
his State and Defense Depart-
ments.
Finally, we are told by the
armchair strategists that our
troops in Korea are now bat-
tle-hardened and fit to fight
elsewhere. This is a very cal-
lous and heartless way to dis-
pose of what has really hap-
pened. No mention is made of
the fact that those troops may
be less, rather than more, effi-
cient after 12 grueling months
of fighting in jungles, moun-
tains and bitter cold. Our cas-
ualties are not battle-hardened.
Most of them will never fight
again.

Finally, the apologists come
to the United Nations. It is
stronger now, they say, be-
cause it has taken steps toward
"collective security." That is
hard for Americans to believe,
for they now know that "col-
lective security" has not been
"collective." As far as the line
has been held in Korea, it is
owing to our own forces, with
valiant if not always effective
help from South Koreans. The
prestige of the United Nations
has never been at a lower ebb
in this country. It has prob-
ably gained no ground abroad.
The Korean war has been
costly in lives, military equip-
ment and in the burden it has
imposed on the American econ-
omy. And it has profited us
nothing. Acheson's talk about
"victory" suggests the com-
ment once made by a visitor at
the Louvre who, after looking
at the battered figure of
Winged Victory, said, "If that
is victory I would like to see
defeat."
