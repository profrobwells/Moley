Truman's Budget Errors
Have a Political Taint
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Once more, with the end of
the fiscal year 1951, the Tru-
man estimates are proved to
be grossly out of line with the
facts. His guess was a deficit
of $2,700,000,000. The fact is
a surplus of $3,300,000,000. This
is a $6,000,000,000 error.
History will give President
Truman two distinctions. He
has had the two largest yearly
surpluses in history. He has
also made the worst blunders
in his estimates. Perhaps his
political mind will figure that
the first of these will merit
the gratitude of his country-
men. But the second should
throw a dark curtain of doubt
over anything he says about
government finances.

Because of this, Congress
ought to sweep aside all his
calculations, requests and
plans for taxes for 1952 and
make its own policy. Nothing
else can reassure a country
that has been treated annually
to such outrageous misrepre-
sentations as the President
has incorporated in his Jan-
uary budget estimates.
Perhaps the President and
Secretary Snyder will try to
explain why January red fig-
ures have turned to June black
figures. They would give the
following reasons:
1-Military equipment has
been ordered but not delivered.
Hence, it has not been paid
for. But this is something
that could have been foreseen
by the brass in the Defense
Department. If the expensive
planners there could not fore-
see that, they are poor people
to be planning the defenses of
the nation. If a man in private
business were unable to calcu-
late better than that he would
soon be in bankruptcy.
2-The great inflation that
was accelerated after Korea
pushed up employment, per-
sonal incomes, corporation
profits before taxes, and the
amount of goods subject to ex-
cise taxes. But anyone on
Jan. 1 could have anticipated
such inflationary rises. They
were open, obvious facts.
3-With inflation certain
government benefits to agri-
culture and personal aid were
bound to decline.
4-Certain efforts of govern-
ment to curb inflation reduced
the necessity for government
outlays.
5-Another factor which
does not appear in the surplus
but is an actual gain is the
rate at which Social Security
taxes pour into the Treasury
and provide cash to pay gov-
ernment expenses. This must
be taken into consideration in
determining whether we need
higher taxes for fiscal 1952.
This underestimation of in-
come and overestimation of
outgo by the President is not
new. It has come to be a
Presidential habit. In 1947-48
he was wrong by nearly
$8,000,000,000,. He has been
consistently wrong.
My insistence on this point
is not based on hindsight. In
this column year after year I
have pointed to the error not
after the event but early in
the year. I did so this year in
January. My calculation was a
simple appraisal of what in-
flationary trends accompanied
by greater business volume
and employment do to tax re-
ceipts. There is nothing mys-
terious about this. It is simple
arithmetic.

We cannot believe that
Presidential advisers in the
Treasury and Budget Bureau
have not known this all along.
There are many experienced
people there and they are not
fools.
What we must reluctantly
conclude is that politics pro-
duces these misrepresenta-
tions. In 1947 Truman was fac-
ing a Presidential election.
He probably wanted to pro-
duce two effects: First, to have
an unexpectedly bright finan-
cial picture for his campaign
for re-election; second, to pre-
vent the 80th Congress from
reducing taxes so that he
would have more money for
his welfare state.
That is probably why the
same deceptive figures have
been produced exactly four
years later-before 1952.
