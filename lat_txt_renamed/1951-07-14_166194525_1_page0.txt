Russia Fears Mao's Rise,
Jap Businessman Thinks
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a letter to me a well-in-
formed Japanese businessman
states his interpretation of the
reasons why Soviet Russia
may have desired an end to
the fighting in Korea.
The views of this man are
his own and cannot be inter-
preted to be those of Japan or
of the Japanese government.
Nevertheless they open some
avenues of speculation which
have not occurred to our arm-
chair strategists in Washing-
ton far from the complex scene
in Asia.

He says that Soviet leaders
may well be concerned lest
Mao Tse-tung and a consolidat-
ed Red China may sometime
be a very troublesome threat
to Russian interests in Asia.
Therefore they are not averse
to a scattering of Mao's mili-
tary potential to Southern and
Southeastern Asia. They are
willing to have the Red Chi-
nese worry the western na-
tions by thrusts toward Ma-
laya, Indo-China and India.
That would definitely play the
Soviet game and also keep
China off balance and weak
against Russian encroach-
ments in Northeastern Asia.
My Japanese correspondent
is not at all assured that a
cease-fire in Korea will end
our troubles with Mao. He
points out that Mao may want
a negotiated truce merely to
get a political solution on his
own terms. In the Chinese
civil war he made repeated
agreements with Chiang Kai-
shek and violated them all
when it suited his purposes
to do so.
The struggle in Asia, says
this Japanese, will he a long
one and the western nations
will face a challenge that will
last a generation or more.
His letter further expresses
the view, following MacAr-
thur's advice, that we should
give Chiang the arms he needs
and permit him to keep the
Chinese Reds off balance by a
threat to open hostilities on
the Chinese mainland. Also
that we should help and en-
courage the guerrilla forces in
the interior of China.
Much of this makes good
sense, especially the point
that Russia wants to remove
the heat of actual warfare
from the neighborhood of
Eastern Siberia and her inter-
ests in Manchuria. Hanson
Baldwin, military commenta-
tor of the New York Times,
makes the point that the So-
viet has lost no important mili-
tary force in the Korean war.
The tanks and planes de-
stroyed have been mostly ex-
pendable, outdated types. Rus-
sia's losses have been insig-
nificant and she cares nothing
for the deaths of Chinese. Her
real reason for favoring a
cease-fire is to remove the pos-
sibility of American bombing
of Manchurian bases. For Rus-
sia does not want to provoke
a world war now.
*
If that be true the Soviet,
President Truman and Gen.
Marshall are in agreement.
Thus the Russian leaders are
disturbed by the extent to
which MacArthur's demands
have gained favor in the Unit-
ed States and by the danger
that if the war in Korea is in-
tensified those demands, es-
pecially for the bombing of
Manchuria, may be turned into
action.
Thus, by an ironical turn, it
may be that MacArthur has
won his argument.
