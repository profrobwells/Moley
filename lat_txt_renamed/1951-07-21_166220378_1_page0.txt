The Dixiecrats Prepare
for States' Rights Fight
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
By an interesting coin-
cidence, two speeches were
made on June 25 by United
States Senators which may
well be the opening of hostili-
ties in a conflict of great his-
torical importance.
In the Senate on that day,
Sen. Hubert Humphrey of
Minnesota introduced with
elaborate oratorical flourishes
a series of bills embodying the
entirÄ— Truman civil rights pro-
gram.
On the same day, in a speech
at Atlanta, Sen. Harry F.
Byrd declared the determina-
tion of the Democrats of the
South to resist, to the point of
repudiating the Democratic
ticket, any effort to force this
program upon the party.
There is not likely to be any
cease-fire in this battle. And
the result may be the defeat of
Truman if he runs again and
continues this assault on what
the South conceives to be the
rights of its States.
Humphrey was joined in
sponsoring the legislation by
Democratic Sens. Benton,
Douglas, Lehman, Magnuson,
Murray, Neely, Pastore, and by
the nominally Republican
Morse. The bills generally fol-
low the recommendations of
the President's civil rights
committee of three years ago.
They provide for Federally
enforced and legally defined
equality of employment oppor-
tunity, the abolition of the
poll tax as a condition of vot-
ing, and the granting of power
to Federal authority to pre-
vent lynching and to punish
people responsible for it, in-
cluding local law enforcement
officers who fail to prevent it.
These are the major bills,
but there are a number of
others dealing with related
subjects. As a whole, this mass
of legislation includes the en-
tire program of those who for
years have been agitating for
Federal interference in mat-
ters which the South regards
as the constitutional rights of
the States.
Essentially, there has been
no retreat from the extreme
position taken by the Presi-
dent three years ago. It was
Humphrey, it will be remem-
bered, who brought about a
reluctant vote on the civil
rights issue in the Democratic
convention in 1948, after which
the Dixiecrats left the hall.
An examination of the full
text of the Byrd speech in
Georgia makes it clear that the
southern Democrats will not
only fight this Humphrey pro-
gram but will demand specific
protections of the rights of
the South as a minority in the
Democratic Party.
They will demand the resto-
ration of the two-thirds rule,
which would give the South a
chance to veto the nomination
of a candidate. They will de-
mand the adoption of a States'
rights amendment such as the
one which was rejected in
1948. And they will fight all
platform endorsements of So-
cialistic measures. The latter,
Byrd explained in his speech,
include government medicine,
the Brannan plan, and "so-
cialized housing."
There is no direct statement
by Byrd that he will join in
an effort to prevent Truman's
election by freeing southern
Presidential electors from any
pledge to support the Demo-
cratic ticket or a movement to
run another national Demo-
cratic ticket.
All he says is that "no Demo-
cratic President can be elected
without the votes of the South-
ern States."
If Byrd later implements
this veiled threat with specific
suggestions of action, the Tru-
man ticket will have hard go-
ing next year. For apparently
this stubborn President is de-
termined to offer no truce in
his civil rights fight.
