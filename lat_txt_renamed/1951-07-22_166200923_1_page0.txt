Some of the Overtones
of Youngdahl's New Job
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
MINNEAPOLISâ€”It could
not have been mere coinci-
dence that within the space
of days Sen. Hubert Humphrey
introduced and sponsored Pres-
ident Truman's controversial
civil rights program in the
Senate and at the same time
was able to secure for the Gov-
ernor of his State an appoint-
ment as a Federal district
judge. However, it is hard to
determine who won what, for
both Truman and Humphrey
seem to have got fine hands
in this deal.
Humphrey now has the dis-
tinction of sponsoring a pro-
gram in the Senate which he
favors, but which will once
more disrupt the party of
which he is a nominal member.
He has removed from his
State a very popular Republi-
can who might have won his
Senate seat in 1954. Truman
has, he believes, disrupted the
Republican Party in Minneso-
ta and has dealt a heavy blow
to Harold Stassen, the man
who in 1948 called him the
country's worst President.
Gov. Luther W. Youngdahl
has won the satisfaction of his
desire to return to a judicial
career which he left to run
for Governor in 1946. He has
also won a barrage of bitter
criticism from people who
have always worked on his
behalf.
Most of Youngdahl's public
life has been spent in judicial
positions. He was a municipal
judge, a district judge and
finally an elected member of
the State Supreme Court. Per-
haps the justification of this
return to the bench would
have been greater if the new
post were in his home State.
It is not, however. He is to
be a Federal district judge in
the District of Columbia. The
propriety and justification of
his decision is now an aca-
demic question, for it is an
accomplished fact. He leaves
the Governorship on Sept. 1.
Youngdahl is the last of
what may be called the Stas-
sen dynasty of Governors.
There was Stassen himself,
elected in 1938, 1940 and 1942.
Then there was Thye, who
served out Stassen's third
term and was himself elected
in 1944. Then there has been
Youngdahl.
The Youngdahl ideology is
considerably to the left of that
of Stassen. He has been a
spending Governor. His first
term's appropriations were
$155,000,000; his last, $280,000,-
000. He has also advocated a
great deal of social legisla-
tion, including an FEPC
which the Legislature failed to
pass. His great vote-getting
capacity is not questioned. He
could easily have been elected
for a fourth term.
Despite the loss of Young-
dahl, the Republican Party in
the State will be in good
shape. Its leader will be Roy
Dunn, national committeeman
and leader in the Legislature.
The man who will succeed
Youngdahl for the 16 months
remaining in his term is C.
Elmer Anderson who, if he
does well, will run to succeed
himself.
He is less showy than his
predecessors but will be able
to work in harmony with his
party. Generally, he is con-
servative.
Harold Stassen, who is still
desirous of retaining his
status in Minnesota politics,
is very bitter about the Young-
dahl appointment because it
will seriously damage his
chance of dominating the dele-
gation to the national conven-
tion in 1952.
Taft is the gainer, because
generally the regular Repub-
licans favor him and will con-
trol the party from now on.
Truman's chance of carrying
the State in 1952 may be some-
what better but is by no
means a certainty.
