Socialism Masquerades
in Clothes of Defense
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Nothing could more clearly
show the intense efforts of the
prevailing advisers of President
Truman to Socialize the
economy than the recent proposals
for a new defense production act.
Proposed additions to the
law enacted a year ago have
been eliminated after a struggle
in Congress. But the fact
that they were seriously offered
by the President and his
leaders in Congress shows
how unrelenting the fight
must be between our traditional
freedoms and national Socialism.
The bill that the President
so ardently spoke about in his
address to the nation five
weeks ago was the most obvious
grab for power that has
yet been made by his administration.
Many of its provisions
were completely unrelated to
price, wage and credit controls.

The President would have
been able, under its provisions,
to grant and to revoke licenses
for every business in the United
States. Under the Selective
Service Act the President already
can take over any business
if it fails to manufacture
what the administration wants
for the defense effort. But under
this new bill, the President
could put the government into
any business. He could set up
government-owned plants
with government-owned corporations
in competition with
private industry. He could
move privately owned plants
from their present locations.
For the complete regimentation
of the farmer, the President
could impose marketing
quotas. Finally, the President
in this bill sought to put on
the statute books the most important
feature of the discredited,
Socialistic Brannan plan
through so-called production
subsidies. The latter would
have been a politician's dream,
because they would have given
the farmer high prices and
the consumer cheap groceries.
The taxpayer would have
stood the cost, but it is an assumption
of this administration
that it can make people
believe that nobody pays taxes
but the well-to-do.
In 1948 Truman sought such
powers as these without an
emergency. In the spring of
that year he sought the power
to put the government into virtually
any business if he was
not satisfied that the national
interest was being promoted
by the people already in that
business.
There was the Spence bill,
which followed the lines of
these Presidential recommendations.
There was also the
fantastic Murray bill. There
was the Brannan plan.
Still earlier, there was the
so-called full-employment bill,
which was passed in a greatly
whittled down form.
All this indicates the Socialistic
trend in administration
thinking. It is more subtle and
vastly more dangerous than
the problem of lax morals revealed
in the RFC and elsewhere
in the government. For
a government in which some
individuals are on the make
can be endured. But a government
which is intent upon
fundamental changes in the
structure of our free system is
stealing from everyone and is
stealing irreparably.
There will be political efforts
this year and next to
blame Congress for watering
down this defense production
legislation. But when such
charges are made, it will be
well to remember that what
Congress actually did was to
frustrate an effort to enact not
only controls but a basic reorganization
of the economy.
