BOISE, Ida—In the fierce
battles with Fair Dealers in
the Northwest and 'bureau-
crats from Washington over
the plan for a Socialistic Co-
lumbia Valley administration
—a battle which now seems to
be running against the Fed-
eral government—the State of
Idaho has stood solidly on
the conservative side.
With the exception of oc-
casional diversions such as
the election of Glen Taylor
to the Senate, the State moves
to the right, especially on is-
sues dealing with electric
power. Among all the West-
ern States, it stands with Ore-
gon as one of the two States
in which public ownership of
electric utilities has made the
least progress.
At the moment Idaho has
a fight of its own against all
the forces of the Interior De-
partment backed by the Presi-
dent. Under the leadership of
Gov. Len Jordan, the State
government and to all appear-
ances most of the people of
Idaho are opposing the con-
struction of the Hell's Can-
yon Dam on the Snake River
on a site where the river is
the boundary between Idaho
and Oregon. The issues in-
volved are too numerous to
be described here. But one
of them has bearing not
only on all Federal power
projects, wherever construct-
ed, but on the future of eco-
nomic freedom in the nation.

Since the day, 18 years ago,
when the late Sen. George
Norris fathered the Tennessee
Valley Authority and Harold
Ickes became Secretary of the
Interior, it has been the pol-
icy of the national administra-
tion to supplant private owner-
ship of the electric power in-
dustry with a government mo-
nopoly.
The legal basis of this in-
vasion was laid in the Tennes-
see Valley legislation. It pro-
vided that in the sale of TVA
power preference should be
given to "States, counties, mu-
nicipalities and co-operative
organizations." Later, in set-
ting up the Bonneville project
in 1937 this discrimination was
made still more positive. The
same idea has been incorporat-
ed in practically every project
since.

Harold Ickes, in his last days
as Secretary of the Interior,
issued directions to "imple-
ment" this Congressional pol-
icy. The Ickes directions were
not only to give preference to
public power and co-operatives
over private utilities but to
give active assistance to the
setting up of public and co-op-
erative agencies to buy power
from Federal projects. Thus,
like the policy followed in the
Wagner Act, in which the Fed-
eral government helped to or-
ganize unions where none ex-
isted before, the Federal gov-
ernment deliberately set out
to create Socialistic agencies
to use Federal power. These
principles have been carried
on to the present day.
A private power company,
no matter how fairly and ef-
ficiently it is serving the pub-
lic, is placed at a terrific
disadvantage. It can usually
buy power only from year to
year with the risk of being
cut off at the caprice of the
Interior Department. Thus, it
is unable to invest its funds
in transmission lines and other
distributing facilities because
of its uncertain and precari-
ous status so far as the source
of its power is concerned. This
is a policy which if followed
to its end will result in a
monopoly for the government.
This threat is in the Hell's
Canyon project; and the State
of Idaho, which is satisfied
with its chief supplier of elec-
tricity, the Idaho Power Co.,
is unwilling to permit this in-
justice to take place.
That is where the contro-
versy stands at this moment.
The decision rests with Con-
gress.
