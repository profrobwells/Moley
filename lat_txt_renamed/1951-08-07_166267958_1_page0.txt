REVERSING
A RIVER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
ASPEN, Colo.—Wherever I
have traveled in the great
mountain region from the
Dakotas to Arizona, I have
found citizens keenly con-
cerned about the planning ac-
tivities of the Bureau of Rec-
lamation and the Army En-
gineers.
It seems that for every
stream, however small, and
for every valley, however de-
tached, the planners of our
busy government have a proj-
ect of some sort and that each
one involves the expenditure
of many millions of dollars. In
a very large number of these
cases the people of the local-
ity have never asked for these
projects and, in fact, violently
oppose them. That is especially
true of the people in and
around this city of Aspen.
The project here is known as
the Gunnison-Arkansas proj-
ect. If constructed, it would
defy the line fixed by nature
at the Continental Divide,
take water from the western
slope of the Rockies and
dump it into the Arkansas,
which flows into the Mississip-
pi.
★
Bureaucrats from the Inte-
rior Department were recently
quoted in a national magazine,
saying, "We and our contrac-
tors enjoy pushing rivers
around." It might have been
added that they also enjoy
pushing around the people who
depend on those rivers.
The setting of this new plan
is the highest section of the
Rockies, about 150 miles direct-
ly west of Colorado Springs.
Just east of the Divide is the
source of the Arkansas River,
which flows south and east
through Salida and Pueblo.
West of the Divide rises the
Roaring Fork River, which
flows north and west past As-
pen and into the Colorado
River at Glenwood Springs.
Running into the Roaring Fork
between Aspen and Glenwood
Springs are the Frying Pan
River and Hunter's Creek.
The great design of the plan-
ners is to build dams on the
Frying Pan and Hunter's Creek
and take the captured water
through 40 miles of tunnels
and canals to the Arkansas.
Then there will be power dams
and plants and irrigation down
the valley of the Arkansas.
★
The irate people on the
western slope are supposed to
be pacified by still another
dam on the Roaring Fork
above Aspen. This is supposed
to capture and supply some
of the water lost by the diver-
sion.
But the people here sus-
pect that sometime later the
diversionists will take the
Roaring Fork water, too, and
give it to the eastern slope.
The cost of this project is
now estimated at about $150,-
000,000, but if the record of
other such projects is dupli-
cated, it will cost three times
that amount.
That is something for the
taxpayers of faraway States
to think about. For at such a
cost there can never be re-
payment to the Federal treas-
ury.
★
Some years ago, there was
constructed a diversionary proj-
ect near Estes Park. It was
the so-called Big Thompson
project. In that case it was
necessary, because of the denial
of water to the western slope,
to build other dams and reser-
voirs for the people there. That
may well be the case here.
Of course, all the usual trick
bookkeeping of the govern-
ment appears in this plan, such
as charging millions off to the
recreational values involved,
including fishing. But from the
appearance of the figures the
fish planned for are of pure
gold.
★
A serious economic problem
may be involved in this diver-
sion, because less than 100
miles from here, down the
Colorado River, is Rifle, where
another branch of the Interior
Department, the Bureau of
Mines, is now conducting ex-
periments in extracting oil
from shale.
This may later be a tremen-
dous industrial development,
for it has been reliably esti-
mated that there is more oil
in Colorado shale than has
been extracted from all the
wells in this country for a
century. Suppose that one
bureau starts something that
makes the diversionary efforts
of the other bureau prove to
be a ghastly mistake. Such
things have happened before in
government planning.
