GOVERNORS'
MEETING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If Gen. Eisenhower accepts
an invitation to be the leading
speaker at the Governors' Con-
ference this year he may find
that the issue of States' rights
will share attention with his
expected plea for European
aid.
The presence of Eisenhower
would be excellent for the con-
ference because it would di-
rect public attention toward
an annual meeting which de-
serves more attention than
it usually gets.
Time was, not many years
ago, when States' rights was
regarded as a somewhat out-
dated shibboleth.

But while civil rights is
still a burning issue which will
probably tear the Democratic
Party asunder, northern con-
servative Republicans are now
concerned with the bearing
of States' rights on many
other great national questions.
An unbeatable alliance against
the party machine headed by
Truman might be created if
those northern Republicans
could make common cause
with their conservative Demo-
cratic brethren in the South.
The time and the place of
the conference should be very
favorable for an airing of the
issue. It will be held in the
South, at Gatlinburg, in the
Great Smokies of Tennessee.
And instead of the usual hot
June meeting, it will be held
on the last day of September
and the first three days of
October. It will be reeking
with political talk and plan-
ning.

There are several reasons
why States' rights will be
prominent in the off-and-on-
the-record talk of the Gover-
nors. The Truman program of
Federal force bills to carry
out his civil rights program
has been introduced in the
Senate by Sen. Humphrey
and a group of Fair Deal col-
leagues.
Apparently, there will be no
abandonment by the President
and his Fair Deal following of
this cause. Sen. Byrd has
warned the President and the
Fair Deal majority of the
party that no Democrat can
be elected without the help of
the South and that the South
will insist on a States' rights
declaration in the Democratic
platform next year.
This demand will almost
certainly be ignored. In many
States of the North, notably
in the West, Republicans are
growing more and more con-
cerned about Federal en-
croachment.
Gen. Eisenhower could, if
he would, bring some unity
between most Republicans
and the South on this issue.
Certainly he will be carefully
and persistently questioned on
the subject if he appears at
the Governors' Conference,
