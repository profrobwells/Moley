Bevan, who is no friend of
the United States, begins by
saying that we have 7% of
the world's population but en-
joy 42% of the world's in-
come. In the first place, I can-
not imagine where he gets fig-
ures on the world's income.
The figures of our own nation-
al income are highly decep-
tive, despite the fact that hun-
dreds of statisticians are
working on them.
A determination of
the world's income would
have to be an act of pure Bev-
anesque imagination. Bevan
goes on to say that every year
things are getting worse-that
is, America is getting richer.
Bevan, following the Labor
Party pattern, does not men-
tion that United States money
has been pouring into Brit-
ain, continental Europe and
the rest of the world. It was
one of the points made by
Churchill in 1950 that the
Labor Party manifesto had de-
liberately failed, in reciting its
achievements, to mention the
help given by the United
States to the British people.
But Bevan proposes that we
give the rest of the world
some real money. We should
give $14,000,000,000 annually
to help develop the undevel-
oped countries. Thus, we
would raise the income of
such countries by 2%.

This calculation is again a
piece of imagination, for no
honest economist could or
would make such an esti-
mate. Bevan asserts that the
United States could easily
provide such a gift to the
world because we are, he says,
spending $68,000,000,000 annu-
ally for military purposes.
We could take it out of that
and we would still have sever-
al billions left for armament,
he says.
Then the demagogue holds
out the promise of plenty for
the British workingman. In
his world mutual-aid plan
Britain would give no money
but about a quarter of a bil-
lion dollars' worth of goods.
This budget of goods would
have to be paid for. Presum-
ably, we would do that. Thus,
British workers would get
more work and more pay.
They would have more food,
better housing, more social
services, free spectacles and
false teeth.
Bevan disposes of the dan-
ger that would accompany a
reduction in armament by
merely asserting that we all
have grossly overestimated
Russian strength and that we
should make a supreme effort
to negotiate a settlement with
Soviet Russia. Thus he piles
guess upon conjecture, with
wishful thinking for frosting.
All this is, of course, "the
stuff that dreams are made
on."
But that is the sort of stuff
that a Labor government has
been using to delude the once-
realistic British people for
years.
Among the many accom-
plishments of Aneurin (Nye)
Bevan as a demagogue is an
amazing capacity to do tricks
with statistics.
In the 1950 Parliamentary
campaign I heard him capti-
vate and stir to action an audi-
ence with nothing but a few
figures that could be written
on half a post card. He would
mention a figure and then ex-
pound for several minutes on
what it meant to British work-
ers. The figure was at best a
half-truth. But before he fin-
ished, his audience had forgot-
ten it and remembered only
the great things that it prom-
ised for the poor of Britain.
In the manifesto "One Way
Only," recently issued by
Bevan and the other left-wing
rebels in the Labor Party, the
Bevan trick with figures is
clearly in evidence. By a few
simple figures he would stop
war threats, rebuke the United
States and provide a long
range of material blessings for
the British working people. It
is all done by the reflection of
statistics in a mirror.
