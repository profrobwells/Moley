Our benevolent government
has always made political cap-
ital of what it would like to do
for little business. And the im-
plication has always been that
the evil oppressor of little busi-
nesses is big business.
It has never admitted that
the real enemy of the little
fellows is big government with
its arbitrary and onerous regu-
lations, its support of big un-
ions, and its tax laws that
hamper small and growing
enterprises.
An excellent example of
what big government can do to
small business is what is hap-
pening to it under the present
mobilization agencies. Most
machine tool companies are
relatively small as industries
go. And their production is
vitally necessary. The prob-
lems they are facing are well
shown by the following ex-
cerpt from a letter written by
a machine tool manufacturer:
"Our very existence is sub-
ject to the whims of the Office
of Defense Mobilization, the
Defense Production Authority,
the General Services Adminis-
tration and the Office of Price
Stabilization. From what little
we have seen of what has-hap-
pened to us so far, we think
it might be a good idea for the
people of these organizations in
particular, and in some of the
other organizations in general,
at least to meet each other oc-
casionally. Sometimes it seems
to us that the folks in these
different agencies never speak
to each other and in fact don't,
even know each other."
This man said further that
only three top officers in his
small company were in posi-
tion to handle the answering
of the many questions that
these agencies were asking, or
could fill out questionnaires, or
hire labor, or buy materials, or
talk with customers, or ar-
range finances with the bank.
They have only a few dozen
employees and they could not
afford to hire more people to
handle all these managerial
problems.
It is truly a harassing life
for these managers of small
businesses, the products of
which are suddenly in great
demand. They must tear off
to Washington every week or
even more frequently. They
must also go to places where
they think they can get
necessary materials.
The writer of the letter said
further that, after he finally
filled out the questionnaire re-
quired under General Price Or-
der 30, he heard that filing had
been postponed the second
time. Also, he then learned
deadlines that had been fixed
had been postponed indefinite-
ly.
It is true that government
does some classifying accord-
ing to the size of businesses,
intending to lighten the load.
But it does not classify them
according to the nature of the
business â€” that is, between
businesses that make what is
known as a repetitive product
type and those that make a custom
type.
Not only is the machine tool
business one which requires
great exactness, but it must
meet constantly changing re-
quirements. Much of it must
deal with custom products. It
is hard enough to keep up with
the infinitely varied require-
ments of production, but when
several agencies in Washing-
ton that are poorly co-ordinat-
ed themselves bear down all
at once, the burden is almost
too great to carry.
