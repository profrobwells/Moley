Missouri States Should
Form a Flood Compact
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the memory of the great
summer floods in the Missouri
Valley fades out in the process
of repairs and reconstruction,
It would seem to be wise if the
States concerned respond to
two of the lessons that are sug-
gested by that damaging ex-
perience.
The first is quite obvious.
Such outbreaks of natural
forces can be prevented by
wisely conceived projects for
flood control.
The other lesson, which
ought to be obvious, is that
when the States in a great
river valley fail to agree upon
a plan of water development
they are inviting all of the So-
cialistic consequence of a Fed-
eral valley authority.

There is every reason to be-
lieve that the exchange of let-
ters on the subject between
President Truman and Philip
Murray, head of the CIO, was
carefully planned in advance.
Rarely do such exchanges take
place without such planning.
The President does not sit
down with his morning's mail
and dictate several pages in
answer to a message, however
long or important it may be.
Someone suggests the ex-
change, and not infrequently
both letters in the exchange
are written by the same per-
son. Perhaps the latter is not
true in this instance, for the
Truman letter is full of authen-
tic Trumanisms. But the theme
is the same, and the conclu-
sions are substantially alike.
The clear purpose of the let-
ters was to force once more in-
to public view the idea of a
Missouri Valley Authority,
modeled after the TVA. An
MVA has been a pet project
of Federal planners for a long
time.
The broad implications of
the plan are quite clear. Un-
der the guise of setting up
a board of control in the re-
gion, instead of in Washing-
ton, with vast powers over
property and State authority,
the plan would in fact vest
enormous control in the Presi-
dent.
The proposed MVA and the
proposed Columbia Valley Ad-
ministration are veritable
blueprints for statism. Beyond
them, the planners have in
mind spreading valley authori-
ties all over the nation. The
result would be what is clear-
ly outlined in the so-called
Rankin bill-a new nation con-
ceived in Socialism, reduced to
seven or eight instead of 48
States, and dedicated to pur-
pose of an ambitious Chief
Executive.
There was practically unan-
imous opposition to an MVA
by the 10 States in the val-
ley, and the Congressional
representatives of those States
have succeeded in stopping
the plan. The Pick-Sloan plan
was not so much a compro-
mise with an MVA as a deal
between the Army Engineers
and the Bureau of Reclama-
tion to pool their respective
building ambitions. The Presi-
dent and Murray are right in
pointing out its inadequacy.
*
The proper solution of such
interstate problems is a com-
pact among the States, by
which they retain control of
their own affairs, with the
Federal government as a part-
ner. This has been frustrated
by the differences among the
States, notably between those
in the upper basin and those
in the lower basin.
It is such differences among
States that provide the argu-
ment for Federal interven-
tion. If the Missouri Valley
States really want to retain
their traditional authority and
rights, it would seem that
their next step should be to
work out some plan of their
own. They must choose be-
tween surrendering some spe-
cial advantages to their fel-
low States or losing all to the
Federal octopus.
