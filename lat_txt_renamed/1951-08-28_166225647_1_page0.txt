BARKLEY
HEDGES
BY AYMOND MOLEY
Vice-President Alben Barkley
has always been regarded
by Senate colleagues of both
parties as a fair-minded and
likable man. He is a gentle-
man and a Democrat of the old
school who, within the limits
of strict partisanship, has
listened to his conscience
without always speaking his
mind.
He has had his crosses to
bear with Roosevelt and Tru-
man, for many of their poli-
cies have been in violation of
every principle for which the
Democratic Party stood when
Barkley was first elected to the
Senate.
It is characteristic of his
many, many campaign speech-
es that he harks back to the
early days of the New Deal,
before Roosevelt veered to the
left. However unrealistic this
habit of living in the past may
be, it has probably been sooth-
ing to the Barkley conscience
but it has not helped to heal
the festering split in his party.
One of the principles for
which Barkley and the Demo-
cratic Party once stood was
States' rights. This is openly
flaunted by Truman's effort to
enact his civil rights program.
In an interview for the
United States News the Vice-
President cautiously approach-
es this subject, which promises
to bring about in 1952 a more
serious revolt than that of
1948.
First he tries to belittle the
issue. He calls it a "little dis-
agreement." It certainly is not
little, because if it were there
would have been some compro-
mise after four years. That
there has not been a compro-
mise is shown by the fact that
Sen. Humphrey, with the
probable blessing of the Presi-
dent, introduced the whole
Federal force-bill program in
June.
But Barkley reassures the
South by saying that the pro-
gram will not be passed in this
session and "probably not in
this Congress."
But Barkley would not
dare to leave such a flat state-
ment unqualified, because that
would be out of line with Tru-
man, so he gives a rather tepid
defense of the poll-tax and fair-
employment features of the
program. It is to be noted that
he does not mention the inde-
fensible antilynching bill,
which is the most objection-
able of all to the South.
Then Barkley brushes aside
the idea of a coalition between
the Republicans and the con-
servative elements in the
South. It is "impracticable,"
he says. The South can vote
Republican if it wishes, he
says, but it will not.
Once more, we may assume
from what he says, the South
will rally to the ticket, despite
its opposition to the Truman
program.
These are, from a partisan
standpoint, hopeful sentiments.
But they are not without a
note of anxiety. For Barkley
is too wise a politician to be
unaware of the signs of the
times. The opposition to Tru-
man in the South is far greater
than it was four years ago.
The major issue in such pri-
maries as the recent one in
Mississippi has been States'
rights. The candidates vied
with each other in opposition
to the Truman program.
The threats of Byrd and
other important southern lead-
ers are far more pointed than
they were in 1948. And the
determination of Trumanites
like Humphrey to prevail is
greater than ever. The conflict
grows more and more irrepres-
sible and nothing that Barkley
can say about a truce can help.
