MR. TRUMAN
AND BONDS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Every right-thinking person
will actively support the campaign of the government in
its savings bond drive which
starts after Labor Day. It is
one of the many possible ways
to check inflation. For whatever is kept out of the stream
of purchasing power through
investment in bonds will
check prices by just that
much.

A person in a position of
influence may have grave
doubts about the sincerity and
effectiveness of the Truman
administration in its alleged
efforts to check inflation in
other ways, but he has a duty
to use his influence to induce
as many persons as possible
to put money in bonds, not
only as a means of saving but
as a personal contribution to
the fight against inflation.

★

The Treasury is properly
emphasizing the note of sacrifice in its preliminary advertising. For to buy bonds at
this time is a sacrifice to most
people. Because of inflation
they are finding it more and
more difficult to supply themselves with what they need
and want. Moreover, the burden of taxation is narrowing
the margin of money that remains after their needs are
supplied.

But President Truman has
a greater responsibility in this
campaign than anyone else.
His responsibility is especially greater than that of any
person who has no official
position. What he says reaches more people. He is the official head of the nation.

★

When he says what he did
in his message on the new
Defense Production Act, which
he reluctantly signed, he is
certainly not encouraging the
buying of bonds. This act is,
he said, "a law that will push
prices up" and over and over
throughout the message he
repeated this idea.

His condemnation of the
controls provided in the new
act is unquestionably inspired
by politics. If, as is predicted,
prices go up in the next year
the President as a candidate
for the Presidency or any
other Democrat who may be
nominated must blame someone. And the 1948 formula
worked so well that it is certain to be tried again.

Such a note will be a counter to the charges by his opponents of extravagant spending, the encouragement of
progressive wage increases and
a stubborn refusal to use the
only really effective means of
checking inflation — a rise in
the interest rate.

★

Economic Stabilizer Johnston joins the chorus by saying that prices will go up 5
to 8% in the next few months.
The effect of such a prediction,
provided anyone takes any
stock in what Johnston says,
would be a rush of dollars into
things before the rise takes
place. Also, it would mean
the withholding of those dollars from the purchase of
savings bonds. For if there is
any such increase it will be
more than the bonds could
possibly earn.

Here is another case of what
happens over and over — one
department of the government
working at cross-purposes with
another. The Treasury's task
will be immensely handicapped
by these inflationary statements.

For it must induce people
to do what the President says
will not be in their interest.
But the Treasury's cause is a
good one and all of us will
have to help where the President has failed.
