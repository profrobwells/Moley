SAN FRANCISCO — The
spontaneous applause that
greeted President Truman's
reference to Gen. MacArthur's
"outstanding leadership" in
Japan was a reminder that the
deposed supreme commander
is far from a faded memory
among the delegates to the
peace conference and the public
in attendance.
In the judgment of this auditor
the response to the reference
was the loudest and most
genuine reaction that greeted
anything the President had to
say. MacArthur has been denied
the honor of being present at
the formal signing of
a peace which he did more
than anyone else to win. That
may be because of many reasons
which need not concern
us here. But he is not forgotten,
and his advice has not
yet been discredited.
Meanwhile, on the same day,
in Washington, the only member
of the Senate panel of 26
who seems willing publicly
to support the President's
method and timing of the general's
removal, Wayne Morse,
filed his lonely, sophistic, quib-
bling, unconvincing and unnecessary
report. It will live
in the obscurity of the long
printed record, but the issues
raised by MacArthur are far
from dead. This is true for
several reasons.
Japanese diplomats are too
tactful to discuss the case here,
but it can be learned from Japanese
correspondents, who are
more free to talk, that the
abrupt removal of MacArthur
was not only a shock to the
Japanese, but that they could
not find justification for the
method and occasion under
which it was done.
They had learned to believe
that MacArthur's way was
America's way, and his attitude
ours. They had tried sincerely
to conform to our purposes,
and MacArthur was the
means through which those
purposes had been communicated
over a period of six
years.
Another reason why MacArthur
is a very live figure here
is the fact that this gathering
has over it the looming threat
of intensified, perhaps decisive
and history-making military
action in Korea. No doubt the
puppets negotiating with
Adm. Joy were told to horse
around—if I may misuse metaphors—until the Gromyko
play could be made here.
But the inscrutable purposes
of the Communists in
Korea may be more than a
mere delay in reaching an
agreement. Informed people
here are profoundly disturbed
by the massing of strength in
Manchuria.
It may prove to be the preparation
for an immense drive
for victory over our forces in
Korea, and none can tell the
outcome. All that we can
know is that if that should be
the next chapter in Korea, it
will bring tragedy to thousands
of American homes. If
that should come, the State
Department control of strategy
there will probably be
broken, and our military will
use the means they have to
win.
That will, in such a case,
be the MacArthur formula
and not the policy of caution
so far followed by the administration.
Despite the words of cheer
and reconciliation that mark
the oratory here, everyone
knows that this treaty business
is only a small item in a
vast play of world forces that
will go on and on for a long
time to come.
