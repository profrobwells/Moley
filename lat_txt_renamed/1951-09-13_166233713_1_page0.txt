RETURN TO
REALITY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The basic issue decided by
the new Japanese treaty and
the U.S.-Japanese security
pact was not stated in the
flowery oratory that marked
the end of the San Francisco
conference. Those speeches
and statements were, as might
be expected, full of the spirit
of peace and reconciliation.
But what has been decided
now by the United States and
other Pacific nations signing
the treaty is the establishment
of a new balance of power in
the Pacific, with a new line of
American defense, consistent
with vital American interests,
from Alaska through Japan,
the Philippines and Formosa
to Australia and New Zealand.
The free nations involved in
that line have already joined
in agreement for mutual aid.
Not so many years ago it
was the habit of one-worlders
to speak of spheres of influence
and balances of power
with horror. World War II
was to end all that and all nations
were to join in a parliament
of man.
But the one world has refused
to come in being. Our gifts
to Soviet Russia have proved
to be fatal acts of folly. Once
more we are thrown back on
realities and we have turned
to the tested means by which
peace has been kept in the
past and by which nations
have protected their essential
interests.
Statesmen like Seward in
the 60s, Blaine in the 80s and
later John Hay and Theodore
Roosevelt recognized that the
protection of vital American
interests and safe defense
against attack from the Far
East required the acquisition
of defensive positions far in
the Pacific. For that reason
Alaska was purchased, Hawaii
annexed and the Philippines
acquired, first by naval strength
and then by purchase. Now two
factors have demanded that
our line of influence be moved
farther to the west and firmly
consolidated by agreements
with friendly allies.
One of those factors is the
rise of air power and other
means of transportation and
communication which have diminished
the strategical area of the
Pacific. The arm of possible
attack is longer now and hence
the arm of defense must be
longer and stronger. The other
factor is the menace of Communist
imperialism and the emergence
of Communist China as a great
military force. Science and enlightenment
have created the first
of these factors. It was the
folly of our diplomacy in dealing
with Russia and China that
created the second.
The Truman-Acheson regime,
the heir and to a degree the
maker of those ill-fated decisions
at Yalta and in China, has
finally seen things as they are
and has taken its stand on the
principles of Seward, Blaine,
Hay and Theodore Roosevelt.
To a degree this change marks
the ascendancy in the history
of foreign policy of T. R. over
F. D. R. It will also mark the
acceptance of MacArthur's assertion
that our interests and our lifeline
demand that Formosa remain
in friendly hands. This despite
the foolish policy, earlier held
by our State Department, that
Formosa was of no strategical
importance to us. The die is
now cast for the new policy,
which is in a sense a return to
the facts of the past. Despite
threats and dangers from the
Communist world, we cannot
waver or compromise.
