Truman's Skipping Over
Mail Rate May Rebound
BY RAYMOND MOLEY.
The facts do not justify the
President's charge that the
government's postal rates are
a subsidy to newspapers and
magazines. From the days of
George Washington these
rates have been regarded as a
subsidy to those who read
newspapers and magazines,
*
Throughout our history the
principle has been stated over
and over, by Presidents and
others, that the government
is justified in carrying cer-
tain second and third class
postal matter at some cost to
the Treasury, as a means of
disseminating information to
the people of the country.
This, it has been emphasized,
is in the interest of promoting
intelligent and informed citi-
zenship.
The President completely
ignored this principle in his
recent speech to postal em-
ployees. Instead, he claimed
that the postal deficit of $500,-
000,000 a year is a "juicy"
subsidy to newspapers and
magazines, notably to the
"slick" magazines and their
publishers. These "slick" mag-
azines have been criticizing
him for the cost of govern-
ment, and this is his way of
squaring accounts with them.
*
The President was speaking
in support of legislation now
before Congress to raise the
mailing rates of magazines
20% a year over the next
three years and of newspa-
pers 10% a year over the next
three years. Labor, religious,
educational and fraternal pe-
riodicals are exempt from this
discriminatory increase.
The President may not real-
ize it, but this effort to at-
tack the "slick" magazines,
whose critical comments he
does not like, may well miss
its mark and mortally injure
a larger number of periodi-
cals against which he has no
present grudge.
For if by "slick" magazines
he means journals of large na-
tional circulation, he is mere-
ly putting up to them a prob-
lem of either raising their
prices or of using means
other than the postal service
for their circulation. It was
pointed out two years ago by
the publisher of one of the
country's largest weeklies
that these magazines can sim-
ply use express and other
services for their major means
of distribution.
*
This will take a very large
amount of business away from
the postal service, and be-
cause of the fact that the
same postal overhead and dis-
tributing facilities must be
maintained, the income of the
Post Office Department will be
sharply reduced. The result
may well be that the postal
deficit will not be reduced at
all.
Another result will be an
increase in advertising and
circulation rates, which can
be sustained by strong maga-
zines. The real victims of the
President's attack will be
small and relatively weak
periodicals, mostly weeklies,
which can neither use other
distributing facilities nor
raise rates. The net of this
will be an increase of resent-
ment in such quarters at this
effort of the President to
punish his critics.
*
The implication in the Presi-
dent's remarks is that if the
magazines are good boys and
quit criticizing his spending
policies, they will not be pun-
ished. This, of course, is an
intolerable condition. A free
press will continue to express
its views, whether the Presi-
dent likes it or not.
