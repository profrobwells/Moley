REPUBLICAN
WOUND
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In politics a low level of
sagacity is just as fatal to
party success as a low level
of morality. That truth is
driven home once more by the
parallel cases of National
Chairmen Gabrielson and,
Boyle.
In the Gabrielson case, the
labor of many months by able
Senators to build up a case
against the Truman adminis-
tration was wiped out by
publicity concerning a situa-
tion that informed people
knew for a long time, that was
never secret but a matter of
public record.
As a matter of law and
probably of business judg-
ment, the RFC loan to Car-
thage Hydrocol, Inc., of which
Gabrielson is president, is not
subject to question. No one,
apparently, was paid for the
use of influence. It seems
likely that the government
will not lose money on this
loan. If public opinion were
not involved, Gabrielson's ex-
planation would be accepted
by any board of directors or
any jury as evidence of com-
plete probity and loyalty to
his responsibilities as a busi-
nessman.

But public opinion will not
weigh all these considerations
and make allowances for
them. When Republicans
charge Truman intimates with
using the. RFC for personal
and political purposes, the
answer will be that the Re-
publican chairman was bor-
rowing for his company, too.
The whole case of bad morals
against the Democrats will
fall flat.
Even the resignation of Ga-
brielson will not repair the
damage. The echo of his inep-
titude will linger on.
Moreover, it seems that Ga-
brielson is still unable to grasp
the fact that the real issue is
not how the RFC is being
used, but the very existence
of the RFC in these times,
long after the reasons for its
creation have vanished.

It is the deliberate opinion
of Herbert Hoover, the foun-
der of the RFC, and of Jesse
Jones, its administrator for 13
years, that it should be abol-
ished.
But even after the fact had
been well established that the
Republican Party as an advo-
cate of sound government
should press for the abolition,
Gabrielson, then president of
Carthage Hydrocol, accepted
the Republican chairmanship.
In short, he directly placed
himself and his party in this
embarrassment, and the lead-
ers of his party who elected
him and have kept him in
office must bear some of the
blame.
