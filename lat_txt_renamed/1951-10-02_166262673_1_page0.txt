THE YEAR'S
BOOK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
To anyone concerned with
the present and future of our
economio well-being, the most
Interesting book of the year
should be the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce survey of
national income, 1951 edi-
tion.
This volume has just ap-
peared after a delay of about
two months. In most years
a condensed version of its
statistical data appears in
the July number of the De-
partment of Commerce sur-
vey of current business. But
apparently in the years be-
fore Presidential elections a
supplement is issued—a de-
luxe affair with a wealth of
graphs and tables and a text
very well printed indeed. At
any rate, one of these ap-
peared in 1947, and another
this year.

Whether the thought oc-
curred to the administration's
people who got this book out
that it might be useful in a
Presidential campaign, de-
ponent answereth not. But
the book, it may be assumed,
will be the more or less holy
script for Democratic orators
next year.
It can be standard refer-
ence, however, for the op-
position, if said opposition has
the wit to arrange some of
the figures to portray what
has really been happening to
our economic life under the
Fair Deal. For the material
is all there, to be used by our
citizenry at the small cost of
$1 a volume.
Already the figures in the
book have been used by Fair
Deal Senators to attack Sen.
George's Senate tax bill. For
in dollar amounts personal in-
comes and corporate profits
have reached exciting heights.
But reduced to dollar and per
capita values, they present a
quite different picture.
Presidential advisers are al-
ready portraying our prosper-
ity in estimates of vast in-
creases in national income.
Workers will be reminded of
immense increases in pay over
the last two decades, and
farmers are reminded of their
unparalleled prosperity.

Space does not permit any
adequate review of the book
here, but from time to time I
shall make selections for use
in this column.
In one spot the authors of
the book have provided a key
to a more rational analysis of
the dollar figures in the book.
The gross national product
was $283,000,000,000 in 1950. In
1939 it was $81,339,000,000. But
corrected for 1939 dollars, it
was a little more than $150,-
000,000,000 in 1950. That is still
a substantial rise.
But before this increase is
taken as a measure of the in-
crease in our national well-
being, we should take into
account the fact that some-
thing has happened for which
neither President Truman nor
President Roosevelt can claim
credit. We have more people
who produce and who can con-
sume.
Reduced to a per capita
basis, using the census figures
of 1940 and 1950, the per capita
income for 1950 was approxi-
mately $1000. For 1939 it was
$631. That is still a fine in-
crease for our collective selves.
It is a real per capita gain of
nearly 60%. Some of us in-
dividually did better than this.
Some did not do so well.
Turning to the comparisons
of average personal incomes,
we find various examples of
wage increases since 1939. In
the manufacturing of "prod-
ucts of petroleum and coal"
there was a dollar increase
from $1852 in 1939 to $4320 in
1950. Reduced to 1939 dollars,
this is an increase from $1852
to $2289. In "water transpor-
tation," the increase has been
from $1553 to $4413. Corrected
for 1939 dollars, this is an in-
crease from $1553 to $2338.
In less fortunate callings, the
increase in the cost of living
and hence the decline in the
value of dollars has brought
about losses—sometimes very
serious ones. Many in the
white-collar group are barely
as well off or worse. Retired
people are decidedly worse off
and their situation is getting
still worse every day.
Before we submit to the psy-
chology of prosperity evoked
by the government, we should
recall that we are not all get-
ting better and better. Some
of us are; some are not.
