F.D.R. SET
A LIMIT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the days pass, the color
of Washington life takes on
a darker and darker shade.
In no period since the short
Harding regime have so many
revolting examples of shabby
ethics been revealed. There
were plenty of lapses from
grace in the Roosevelt years.
Some of them have been re-
vealed, and more examples
are to come. But Roosevelt,
with all his shortcomings, had
a streak of idealism which re-
vealed itself from time to time
in very obvious ways.
It was Roosevelt who, in
1934, declared that no mem-
bers of the Democratic Nation-
al Committee or, in fact, no
high political figure should
maintain a private law prac-
tice in the District of Colum-
bia. Some of the gentlemen
affected by this declaration
quit the committee; others de-
cided to practice their trade
elsewhere. Good lawyers were
hit by this policy, such as Ar-
thur Mullen of Nebraskaâ€”
lawyers who could make a liv-
ing without political influence.
But when the Roosevelt blow
fell, there were several who
were not so gifted and, like
Othello, they found their "oc-
cupation gone."

I was in a position in the
early years of Roosevelt's ad-
ministration to see this at first
hand.
When diplomatic posts were
to be filled, there were many
who felt that they had bought
Ambassadorships and other
jobs by fat contributions to
Roosevelt's campaign. Reso-
lutely he declared a policy of
promoting a fairly large num-
ber of competent career men,
despite political demands of
several whose sole claim was
monetary.
That rich hunting ground
for political profits, the Treas-
ury, was guarded by Henry
Morgenthau, whose shortcom-
ings did not include any tol-
erance for improper private
profit seeking.

Jesse Jones was not blindly
suspicious but he was unbe-
lievably shrewd in protecting
the RFC. He had plenty of
nudges from the White House
and from people around that
place of power. But when a
loan was suggested that was
abhorrent to his business
sense, he found a way, some-
times a circuitous way, to
frustrate it.
As time went on and Roose-
velt felt the security of a sec-
ond and third term, the earli-
er streak of idealism nar-
rowed. But in general there
were limits to political profit
at public expense.
There were no splittings of
hairs about a political figure
who accepted cases before he
received a party salary and
after. And the RFC was not
nearly so receptive to bad
loans. Probably things would
have worsened in a fourth
Roosevelt term, but they al-
ways do when a party has
been in power too long.
