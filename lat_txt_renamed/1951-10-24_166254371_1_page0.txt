A SCANDAL HITS HOME
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may well be that the most
serious indictment of the Tru-
man regime will not come
from the spectacular investi-
gations of Fulbright, Kefauver
and McCarran, but from the
investigation of Federal tax
collectors energized so far by
Sen. John J. Williams of Dela-
ware.
Williams is not one of the
more prominent Republican
Senators. He is not brilliant
or showy, but slow, earnest
and deeply concerned with the
problem of integrity in gov-
ernment. He comes from a
small town in what used to
be called contemptuously in
Delaware, "the sands of Sus-
sex." He left high school at
18 to enter the grain business.
If any Senator knows what
will stir the so-called "common
man" of America, it is Wil-
liams. And of all the moral
failures of this administration,
this internal revenue mess is
most likely to move voters to
action.
*
For a very considerable
time, subcommittees of both
House and Senate have been
investigating charges of inter-
nal revenue irregularities
made by the Kefauver com-
mittee. Last May, Sen. Wil-
liams, in a long speech in the
Senate, gave detailed informa-
tion about the strange and, if
true, very wrongful activities
of James P. Finnegan, who un-
til his resignation was Collec-
tor of Internal Revenue at St.
Louis. Again and again since
then, Sen. Williams has added
new facts and charges concern-
ing other internal revenue ir-
regularities. Meanwhile, the
House committee has kept up
its investigation.
Now we learn from testi-
mony more information about
the Finnegan affair. Secre-
tary of the Treasury Snyder
says that he asked for Finne-
gan's resignation in August,
1950. He apparently repeated
this request over a period of
several months without suc-
cess. Finally, when Finnegan
did resign in April, 1951, Wil-
liams wrote to Snyder urging
him to give the reasons for the
resignation and to state what
the Secretary proposed doing
about conditions in the St.
Louis office. Snyder replied
that Finnegan's resignation
was purely voluntary and that
there was nothing wrong in
the St. Louis office.
â˜…
Thus, Secretary Snyder had
a lapse of memory either in
April or in October. Perhaps
he has forgotten what he
wrote in April.
Moreover, if he was able to
say in April that nothing was
wrong in St. Louis, he cer-
tainly was woefully ignorant
of what many people knew
more than a year ago. And if
nothing was wrong in St.
Louis, why has Snyder laid
down a whole series of rules
of conduct for collectors?
Snyder's confusion is almost
as deplorable as the failure of
President Truman and his sec-
retary, Matt Connelly, to back
up Snyder's effort to oust Fin-
negan.
This unfolding picture of in-
come-tax fixing is the most se-
rious moral failure yet. I can-
not recall that there has ever
before been a serious charge
of that nature since the adop-
tion of the income tax amend-
ment nearly 40 years ago.
None came to light under the
suspicious and honest Morgen-
thau. This is something new,
and something very bad in-
deed.

How can the government ex-
pect millions of people to sub-
mit honest tax returns if they
know that the people who get
them may be dishonest? Noth-
ing could do more to encour-
age cheating, just when the
government needs more and
more money.
Moreover, these revelations
will stir the resentment of peo-
ple far more than the irregu-
larities in the RFC. They will
hit them directly in their own
pocketbooks. It is bad enough,
the average man will say, to
be called upon to pay more
and more taxes. But to respond
to this call when people fa-
vored by politicians are escap-
ing their own taxes is too
much indeed.
