The most recent issue of Col-
lier's magazine is devoted to a
piece of fiction that should
never have been written. If
written, it should never have
been published. It is exactly
the sort of thing that Soviet
propaganda will use to
"prove" that the United
States is determined to con-
quer the world. There has
been nothing like this since
Orson Welles' radio show
about the invasion from Mars.
The general title of this
lurid affair is "Preview of the
War We Did Not Want." A long
list of people, many of them
well known, are featured con-
tributors. Most of them should
have known better than to
contribute to this collection.
The major or "theme" article
is by Robert E. Sherwood.
This anthology tells of an
imaginary war with Soviet
Russia, beginning in Yugo-
slavia in 1952. The United
States is joined by principal
U.N. nations in a declaration
of war. "Hostilities" go on
three years until Russia is
crushed, occupied, and com-
pletely set to rights according
to the prescriptions of the
Collier's authors.
The great cities of the
United States are A-bombed,
with terrific carnage. Wash-
ington is practically destroyed.
North America is invaded.
Then we bomb Moscow and
other Soviet centers. We land
parachute troops in the Urals
at a cost of 9000 men. The
slaughter drags on until Rus-
sia disintegrates into a state
of chaos.
Commentators tell breath-
less, on-the-spot stories of our
exploits. And artists provide
sensational pictures of ruin
and destruction on both sides.
The loss of life, civilian and
military, is tremendous.
But after all is over and we
occupy Russia, wonderful
things are done by the con-
querors. Art, religion, educa-
tion and sports are intro-
duced according to Collier's
standards. And a Roman, or
U.S.-U.N., peace settles down
for all time.
All this fits in very well
with the stuff that Soviet Rus-
sia has been telling the world.
We are, they say, war-minded.
We are determined to use our
power to destroy those who
disagree with us and their
forms of government and their
culture. This text and these
pictures can now be used to
bolster their case.
It doesn't matter that this
imaginary war, according to
Sherwood et al., was started by
Russia. In Soviet propaganda
that part of the story can be
blacked out. What they will
undoubtedly do will be to use
this bit of journalism to
"show" what the United States
plans to do.
The impact of this indiscre-
tion in print will be used in
Western Europe as well.
Aneurin Bevan, the left-wing
leader of the British Labor
Party, can use it to show his
followers that we are "lead-
ing" the British people into
war. It can be used by ev-
ery "neutralist" in France to
discredit American aims. In
Britain and in France there
is plenty of talk already that
the United States is not arm-
ing for peace but for war.
That falsehood will be be-
lieved by more people now.
I will not speculate on what
journalistic or publishing pur-
pose has motivated this effort.
It is sensational, to say the
least, and it will be bought
and read. Certainly such a
terrible warning is not needed
by the American people. For
the Congress just adjourned
has voted the vast sums asked
by those who are preparing
our defenses. And the people
are behind that action by their
representatives.
Journalism has a purpose
far more important than the
stimulation of emotions or
newsstand sales. It is to lead
opinion wisely. Moreover, it
is properly to portray our na-
tional purposes, our govern-
ment and our culture to oth-
er countries. This specimen
will not meet that test. It is
not responsible journalism.
For it does not represent the
true purposes and feelings of
the American people.
