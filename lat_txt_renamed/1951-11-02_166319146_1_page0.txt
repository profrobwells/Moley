SELF-HELP
ON WATER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

MOUNT POCONO, Pa.—A
serious group has been meeting
here to plan the development
of the Delaware River through
an interstate compact
among four States—New
York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
and Delaware. Above all,
these people are determined
to keep the ubiquitous nose of
the Federal government out of
this particular job.
They want no tyrannous
Federal “authority” in this region.
And they make no plea for the
narcotic of Federal money in
this great conservation project.
This is a most wholesome
declaration of the almost
neglected American principle
of States’ rights. Perhaps,
after all, this is the sort of
issue upon which conservative,
self-dependent people both in
the North and South can unite.

The Interstate Commission
on the Delaware River Basin
calls itself the Incodel. It
originated in 1936 and for a
long time carried on a slow
process of education. Finally,
in 1919, there was enacted by
the Legislatures of three
States, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and New York,
legislation authorizing a comprehensive
engineering survey of the
Delaware River. The objective
is a water conservation
project for the great basin of
the Delaware.

The Delaware River rises in
the mountains of New York. It
flows southward and bounds
the four States associated in
Incodel. It provides the indispensable
means of life for the most
populous and heavily industrialized
area in the nation. New York,
Philadelphia, Wilmington, and
many other cities must, as the
years pass, depend upon the
waters of this river and its
tributaries. At the moment,
most of this water flows
wastefully into Delaware Bay.

Exceedingly serious is the
problem of sea water in the
lower ranges of the river. This
is an acute menace to the vast
industries of the region around
Philadelphia, Camden and Wilmington.
Equally important is the grave
threat of water shortages in New
York City and Northeastern New
Jersey. No New Yorker needs
to be reminded of the great fear
of a threatened water shortage
in his city two years ago. Nature
came to the rescue then, but
Nature cannot be relied upon.
The Incodel plan is to build
four dams in the upper reaches
of the river above the Delaware
Water Gap. These would hold
up hundreds of billions of gallons
of good water. From that store
there would be drawn through
tunnels and aqueducts an abundant
supply for New York City and
eastern New Jersey.

Through the regulation of
the river flow, clean, fresh water
uncontaminated by salt from
the bay would go to the people
and industries of the lower
basin. There would, incidentally,
be created artificial recreation
areas in the upper valley. New
York, with the frightening
experience of two years ago in
mind, is eager to go ahead with
the project. New Jersey, too, is
ready to go. In fact, New York
State proposes to go it alone by
action before the Supreme Court
if the project is further delayed.

The national significance of
this proposal is an example and
a warning to other States which
have foolishly permitted ambitious,
grasping agencies of the Federal
government to invade their water
resources through great tax-supported
reclamation projects. Incodel
says—bluntly that if there should
be created a Federal Delaware
Valley authority, it would mean
control by “a handful of men in
Washington.”

That would mean the end of
States’ rights and responsibilities
in the field of water conservation
and development. It would threaten
the essential sovereignty of every
State concerned.
