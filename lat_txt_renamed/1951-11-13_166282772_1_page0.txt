ELECTION
SHADOW
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The election of Rudolph
Halley to the important office
of President of the City Coun-
cil of New York has been at-
tributed to the general wave
of indignation against corrup-
tion in government. This also
explains the result in Phila-
delphia and in several other
places over the country.
But there were factors in the
New York City election which
deserve a great deal of atten-
tion and which have a distinct
bearing on the 1952 prospects.
Taking a leaf from the book
of the Dewey of the 1930s,
Halley presented himself as a
fearless enemy of crime and a
gang buster. He was also pro-
moted as the exponent of the
Liberal Party—a party which
favors a wide measure of So-
cialism short of Communism.
His opposition to the present
3% city sales tax won the
votes of many people who are
coming to be sharply conscious
of the taxes generally.
The sincerity of this gesture
toward lower taxes can be
questioned, because the Abra-
ham Lincoln of the New York
Liberal Party, the late Fio-
rello LaGuardia, originally
sponsored and secured the en-
actment of the New York City
sales tax. The phoniness of
this issue of Halley’s is further
underlined by the advocacy of
his Liberal Party of all sorts of
Fair Deal welfare which would,
if enacted, make the present
tax burden seem puny in com-
parison.

But aside from these means
of vote catching, Halley’s vic-
tory was attended by other
very significant portents. The
most important of these was
the evidence of continued de-
cay in the once invincible New
York City Democratic machine.
For more than 20 years the
most powerful figure in New
York politics has been Edward
J. Flynn, boss of the Bronx
and formerly chairman of the
Democratic National Commit-
tee. His influence with Presi-
dent Roosevelt was very great,
almost decisive. Federal pat-
ronage flowed into the Bronx,
where Flynn’s word was law.
Great Democratic majorities
were always easy to get. It
was the most securely held
and bossed of all the boroughs.
Even the Republican leader
there was held in hostage by
a good job which Flynn per-
mitted him to hold.

But ever since the death of
Roosevelt there have been evi-
dences of decay in the Bronx.
In 1946, Flynn lost a Congress-
man to a Republican. This was
an astonishing turn of events.
In 1945 it was William O’Dwyer
who put himself into the race
for Mayor. Flynn reluctantly
had to accept him. In 1950
Flynn took a double beating.
His candidate for Governor
was a Bronx Congressman who
made a deplorable showing
against Dewey. And Vincent
Impellitteri defied Flynn and
roundly defeated Flynn’s man
for Mayor.
Meanwhile, the Bronx dis-
trict leaders are growing old.
For too long they have lived
peacefully in the Flynn Wel-
fare State of politics.
The Bronx vote this year
was low, which is always a
reflection on political leader-
ship. In 1949 when O’Dwyer
was running, he had nearly
50% of the vote. Last Tuesday
the Democrat received 29%.
This is not the Bronx of old.
★
Another significant portent
in the New York City vote was
the strong showing of the Re-
publican candidate for Council
President, Congressman La-
tham of Queens. He cam-
paigned mainly on national is-
sues, with the Truman ad-
ministration as a target.
So while the Philadelphia
election may place heavy odds
against Republican chances
of carrying Pennsylvania next
year, the New York City result
should favor a Republican vic-
tory in New York State.
