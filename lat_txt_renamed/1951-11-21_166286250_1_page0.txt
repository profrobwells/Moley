Sen. Taft's book, "A Foreign
Policy for Americans," ought
to lay the ghost of isolationism
so far as he is concerned. For
this statement of his faith pic-
tures the United States as a
great, predominant influence
in the world.
In comparison, the Truman-
Acheson policy is narrowly
nationalistic. For Taft is not
only willing to lend a strong
arm to Europe but he draws a
line of American interest in
Asia far to the west of that
formerly favored by Roose-
velt, Truman, Marshall and
Acheson.
In the light of this, Sen.
McMahon's complaint that
Taft is still an "isolationist" is
ridiculous. Apparently that
Truman spokesman is unable
to argue except in epithets.

It takes courage for a candi-
date for the Presidential nomi-
nation to write a book. Most
successful candidates for Presi-
dential nominations in our his-
tory have been canny and non-
committal. Their talk was
mostly double talk. Most men
with specific records have
either failed to get the nomi-
nation or have lost the elec-
tion.
The politicians who nomi-
nate a President do not prefer
frankness in a candidate. Taft's
record is already made. It is
in thousands of speeches and
hundreds of Senate roll calls.
He could not be noncommittal
if he chose to be. The best he
can do is to clarify, condense
and underline his views.
This he has done in the field
of foreign policy in the 125
pages of his book. And it de-
serves to be said that Taft em-
ployed no ghosts to write his
book. He wrote every word
himself. In fact, I heard one
Republican who is very near
to and friendly with him say
that he was overanxious in ac-
cepting no help from anyone.
★
This book will be of distinct
value to two sorts of people.
It will provide for friends of
Taft a quick way of answering
the cliches that they must hear
every day about Taft's isola-
tianism. It will also provide
for the general reader a good
summary of the problems fac-
ing us in the world from the
point of view, of course, of a
Republican and an opponent of
the party in power.
There are two aspects to this
book. The one is an indict-
ment of our government's for-
eign policy in the past. The
other is Taft's forward look.
Anyone could have written the
indictment. Only Taft could
have, stated his present out-
look. That outlook certainly
takes a broad view of our re-
sponsibilities in the world.
In Europe he would have us
live up to our obligations in
the Atlantic pact and fight if
any our our allies are attacked.
He favors contributing a num-
ber of divisions, presumably
six, to the proposed European
army. He would contribute
arms for European elements in
such an army.
★
In Asia he would hold For-
mosa at all costs and also give
aid and encouragement to Chi-
ang's Nationalists. His views
on the Korean war are not un-
like those of Gen. MacArthur.
Generally, he would avoid
committing large armies of
foot soldiers, either in Europe
or in Asia. He would develop
air power far beyond the plans
of the administration. And he
would favor committing the
United States to war if any of
our Atlantic pact partners,
any member of the British
Commonwealth, Japan, For-
mosa or the Philippines were
attacked.
Taft's fear is that in stress-
ing an army of foot soldiers
we shall break down our
economy. Therefore, he would
place a limit of $75,000,000,000
on the budget. For he believes
that it would be an ill service
to the world to break ourselves
in the process of giving to
others.
