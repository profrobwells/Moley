VINSON AND
THE SOUTH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A very prominent anti-Tru-
man southern Democrat whom
I questioned about the pro-
posal to placate the South by
nominating Chief Justice Vin-
son replied sharply: "Read the
Texas and Oklahoma opinions
by Vinson. They will tell you
why we are against him, too."
I read the opinions again
with great care, and I can
clearly understand my south-
ern friend's indignation. The
Texas case (lawyers can find
it in 339 U.S.) involved a Negro
who in 1946 applied for ad-
mission to the Law School of
the University of Texas at
Austin.

He was barred. However,
since the interpretation of the
14th Amendment to the Con-
stitution at that time permit-
ted separation of the races in
schools but required States to
provide equal school facilities,
Texas provided a State law
school for Negroes.

This first school was tem-
porary, but before the Vinson
decision, another, better one
was created. This one, accord-
ing to Vinson in 1949, "is ap-
parently on the road to full
accreditation. It has a faculty
of five full-time professors; a
library of 16,500 volumes serv-
iced by a full-time staff; a
practice court and legal aid
association."

Nevertheless, the Chief Jus-
tice in deciding the case de-
clared that this school did not
provide "equal facilities."

The Chief Justice might
have stopped there and com-
pelled Texas to admit the pe-
titioner to the University of
Texas Law School.

He proceeded to state a prin-
ciple of equality which would
prevent the State or any State
from providing "separate but
equal" facilities.

For Vinson proceeded to
say: "Few students and no one
who has practiced law would
choose to study in an academic
vacuum, removed from the in-
terplay of ideas and the ex-
change of views with which
the law is concerned. The law
school to which Texas is will-
ing to admit petitioner ex-
cludes from its student body
members of the racial groups
which number 85% of the pop-
ulation of the State and in-
clude most of the lawyers,
witnesses, jurors, judges and
other officials with whom pe-
titioner will inevitably be deal-
ing when he becomes a mem-
ber of the Texas bar.

"With such a substantial and
significant segment of society
excluded, we cannot conclude
that the education offered pe-
titioner is substantially equal
to that which he would re-
ceive if admitted to the Uni-
versity of Texas Law School."

In the Oklahoma case a
Negro graduate student in ed-
ucation had been admitted to
the university and had been
permitted to attend classes, use
the library and restaurant with
white students. But he was as-
signed to a seat in the class-
room, a table in the library
and a place in the restaurant
reserved for Negro students.

Vinson declared that "such
restrictions impair and inhibit
his ability to study, to engage
in discussions and exchange
views with other students and,
in general, learn his profes-
sion." Hence these differences
in treatment must be removed.

If this principle be true of
a law or graduate school, it is
going to be possible to make
the same case regarding, first,
the colleges, then the high
schools and finally the lower
grades.

For all education is prepara-
tion for life. In that life in
the world a person's occupa-
tion will mean contacts with
all races. Hence, according to
the Vinson doctrine, the
schools must provide equally
indiscriminate contacts.

Thus, the Chief Justice has
opened a wide door which he
might not have opened at all.
This should be enough to ex-
plain why the Chief Justice
may not be the next President
of the United States.
