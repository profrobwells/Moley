On the Perils Created
by Pay Escalator Plans
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two items of news this
week suggest a line of specu-
lation on the perils created by
wage escalator plans. The two
bits of news seem quite unre-
lated, but they can ultimately
have a meeting place in the
crazy world into which we
seem to be moving.
The first is the new demand
of unions that income taxes be
included in the official cost-of-
living index.
The other is the charge by
Sen. Taft that, in violation of
the law, employers deducted
political contributions from
union members' pay.
The suggestion of adding in-
come taxes to the cost-of-living
index starts an endless series
of consequences. Let us see
how the new device to squeeze
additional compensation would
work.
It would mean that every
time the cost of what the gov-
ernment buys rose and taxes
rose, the cost-of-living index
would be adjusted. That would
justify, under the escalator
plan, a new increase of wages.
That would increase the cost
of what the government must
buy. Hence, new taxes, etc.,
etc.

It would take an army of fig-
uring bureaucrats to keep up
with this business, because as
the cycle proceeded the work-
er's income would go into
higher brackets and the cost-
of-living index would be out
of kilter again. Then it would
be corrected. But the rise
would increase progressively
until the pace would be dizzy-
ing.
It might be added that as
new complications arose, more
accountants would have to be
employed by the government.
Then the cost of government
would go up, also taxes, also
cost of living, also wages, also
everything.
But if this principle of adding
taxes to the cost of living
should apply to wage earners,
it would have to apply to
farmers. Hence, it would be
added in the parity index.
This would increase the cost
of living, because farmers
would have to get higher
prices for their products.
Moreover, a year or so ago,
it was proposed by Prof. Sumner
Slichter that the escalator
be applied to certain govern-
ment bonds—that is, that in-
terest rates be increased in
line with the cost of living.
If we should put income taxes
into the cost-of-living index,
that increase would be re-
flected in what government
would have to pay for bor-
rowed money. That would af-
fect the cycle directly.
★
Finally we come to the Taft
charge that employers deduct-
ed political contributions from
the pay of union members.
Union officials in Ohio denied
any intent to collect campaign
contributions in that way. One
of them said, however, that if
such collections were made,
the money would have been
returned to union members if
they had complained.
Union officials insisted that
political contributions are vol-
untary. This we can take with
a grain of salt because many
union members give such do-
nations because they are
afraid not to give. In any
event, since such contribu-
tions are now a part of the
load on a worker’s budget,
perhaps they, too, will go into
the cost-of-living index. That
would not be an illogical con-
sequence of this new union
demand.
