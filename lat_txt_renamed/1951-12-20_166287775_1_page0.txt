EISENHOWER
THE MAN OF
NO PARTY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The supporters as well as
the opponents of Dwight Eisen-
hower for President have been
debating for some time the
question of what party line
the general belongs to or is in
sympathy with.
In that connection, it has
been said on two recent tele-
vision shows that Eisenhower
In his years at Columbia Uni-
versity had refused to express
a party choice when he regis-
tered to vote.
To satisfy myself on this
point, I went to the Board of
Elections and personally in-
spected the records. The facts
are as follows:
When a voter registers in
New York City he receives a
printed form on which to
state his party preference.
There is space on this form
for the name of the voter, and
he subscribes to some lan-
guage which includes these
significant words:
"I am in general sympathy
with the principles of the
party which I have designated
by my mark hereunder; that
it is my intention to support
generally at the next election,
State or national, the nomi-
nees of such party for State
or national offices."
â˜…
Below these words are the
names and insignia of four
parties, with a space for a
cross under each. The parties
in the last few years have been
Republican, Democratic, Lib-
eral and American Labor. Be-
low that is a brief explanation
that this enrollment is for the
purpose of qualifying voters
to participate in primary elec-
tions in the following year.
The voter takes this piece of
paper into the booth and marks
or refrains from marking a
choice. Then he folds it and
puts it in a ballot box. This
box is opened after election,
and the rolls are made up in-
dicating which party each vot-
er chose or whether he chose
none at all.
Gen. Eisenhower lived in
New York as president of
Columbia University in 1948,
1949 and 1950. He was, of
course, a civilian. He could
not have voted in 1948 because
he had not lived in New York
long enough.

On Oct. 15, 1949, he regis-
tered in the 43rd Election Dis-
trict of the 7th Assembly Dis-
trict. His party preference
slip showed no party prefer-
ence. That is, he expressed no
"general sympathy with the
principles" of any party. In
short, he made no cross under
any party name.
On Oct. 13, 1950, he regis-
tered again, and again deposit-
ed the slip without any party
preference. Each year Mrs.
Eisenhower registered in ex-
actly the same way as her hus-
band.
These facts are set forth
merely for information. I am
not drawing any inferences
from them.
*
It is true, however, that the
office he held at Columbia has
traditionally offered the great-
est latitude for party activity.
From the days of William
Samuel Johnson, who signed
the Constitution of the United
States and was president of
Columbia until 1799, the heads
of this institution have gener-
ally been active party men.
Nicholas Murray Butler was
a delegate to every Republican
convention during his long,
active life. His predecessor,
Seth Low, ran and was elect-
ed Mayor of New York.
This bit of history is added
to show that there was no tra-
dition or requirement in the
office of president of Columbia
to deter Gen. Eisenhower. His
decision to forego a declara-
tion must therefore be as-
sumed to be a matter of free
choice.
