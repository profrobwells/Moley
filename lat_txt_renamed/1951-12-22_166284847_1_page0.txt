Stockholder Census May
Kill Myth About Rich
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Keith Funston, president of
the New York Stock Ex-
change, has promised that his
organization is going to con-
duct the first stockholder cen-
sus in history. This is good
news.
The results, however, will
not be good news for those
demagogues who have sought
to create class feeling between
stockholders and workers.
The implication of every de-
mand for inflationary wage in-
creases is that certain rich men
are hauling in vast profits
while workers and housewives
are struggling with the high
cost of living. A real census
of stockholders will probably
show that these profits be-
long mostly to people in very
moderate circumstances and
that the ownership of our in-
dustrial plant is about as demo-
cratic as the wage-earning
group itself.

The statistics which Mr.
Funston is seeking are very
elusive. Excellent economists
have been pondering this ques-
tion for a long time. One of
the best of them, Rufus Tuck-
er, says that the figures on
stock ownership are so elu-
sive that "you can choose any
number between 6,000,000 and
26,000,000 without exceeding
the bounds of possibility." Mr.
Tucker's guess is that about
11,500,000 people own stock.
The difficulty in arriving at
an exact figure is due to many
factors. Mr. Tucker points
out that income tax returns
are inadequate as a guide be-
cause people in the lower in-
come brackets are likely to
omit small items, including
dividends on a small amount
of stock.
Also, in the Federal Reserve
Board's survey of consumer
incomes the figures are faulty
because people in the higher
income brackets are not will-
ing to disclose their affairs to
voluntary surveyors. And the
companies themselves cannot
always know all the owners
of stock because of holdings
by brokers and also because
of rapid turnover.

The U.S. Treasury's publica-
tions on "Statistics of Income"
for various years cannot pro-
vide us with exact figures,
but they offer a good clue to
the trend of ownership. Ac-
cording to this source 85% of
dividends in 1916 went to peo-
ple with incomes of $5000 or
more. In 1922 that percentage
was 81. But in 1947 it had de-
clined to 56%.
These figures must be meas-
ured against changes in the
rates of taxation. In other
words, not so many were
taxed in 1916 and 1922 as in
1947.
The conclusion can safely
be drawn that Mr. Funston is
right when he predicts that
his survey will show that
American industry is not
owned by a few greedy profit-
mongers, as the demagogue
would have you believe, but
by the vast middle-income peo-
ple of the nation.

These people, and they in-
clude millions of wage earn-
ers, should realize that their
interests are deeply involved
in such demands as are now
being made in the steel wage
issue.
"The contest is not between
"the few and the many." It
is between the many and the
many. And there are proba-
bly many more stock owners
than union members.
