Several things may happen
in the promised Truman clean-
up affair before this dispatch
appears in print. Or, what is
more likely, nothing will hap-
pen. But this is written in the
confident feeling, that, in any
case, the President and his ad-
visers cannot find a legal way
to do what has been promised.
After looking at this prob-
lem from all sides, I feel con-
vinced that there is no ef-
fective legal way in which
this administration can purge
itself of corruption. The evil is
spread too generally through
the vast, shambling reaches of
the government. And the legal
means of self-correction are
too meager.
At this writing it is apparent
that Judge Thomas F. Mur-
phy has reached the same con-
clusion. If he had done a bit
more thinking before he en-
joyed his latest bath of publici-
ty, he should have realized
that fact from the beginning.
It is now reported that Judge
Murphy has decided not to ac-
cept the task for three reasons:
He could not get the men he
wanted to serve with him; he
would have no power of sub-
poena; he would injure his
status as a judge and injure
the prestige of the bench it-
self.
There are two additional
reasons that might or should
have deterred him. These are
that no man could accomplish
such a task and also, if there
were such a man, his name
would not be Murphy.
Let us consider the second
of these reasons first. Judge
Murphy is a man of fine char-
acter; he is sincere and, in
what he has done so far, com-
petent.
His experience, however, has
been decidedly limited. He
came from the Bronx, which
means that his probable spon-
sor was Edward J. Flynn,
boss of that borough. His ex-
perience has been limited to
the U.S. District Attorney's
office in New York. It can be
assumed that he is not familiar
with the ramifications of the
Washington bureaucracy.
He was largely engaged in
tax and insurance cases when
he was plunged into the Hiss
case. He did not prepare that
case. It was really the product
of fine work by the FBI.
When Hiss was indicted by
the grand jury, Murphy was
in Europe on a tax case. He
did his job well, however, in
the two trials and well de-
served promotion to the bench.
A short turn as Police Com-
missioner of New York added
something to his experience.
This is a rather scanty
equipment for the biggest in-
vestigation of our time. Great
political investigators of the
past, such as Thomas Walsh
in the Tea Pot Dome affair
and Samuel Seabury in New
York City, were men of sea-
soned experience.
But a combination of Walsh
and Seabury would be inade-
quate for the task that needs
to be done in Washington.
Walsh was concerned with
two or three actions that in-
volved only three Federal
departments. Seabury dealt
with only selected depart-
ments in one city. The trail
of corruption and maladminis-
tration in Washington already
runs through the Treasury
and Justice Departments.
There are also the RFC, the
Office of Alien Property and
probably many other agencies.
Nothing like this has ever
faced an investigator before.
My information for 10 days
has indicated clearly that Pres-
ident Truman was acting in
his usual pell-mell fashion
when he promised to investi-
gate. Neither he nor anyone
else had the slightest idea of
how it was to be done, wheth-
er by a commission created by
executive order, by appoint-
ment of a special Attorney
General or, in fact, by the
ousting of McGrath and the
appointment of a new Attor-
ney General.
The calling of Murphy to
Washington amid tremendous
tub-thumping was a diversion-
ary move. After Murphy re-
turned to New York the great
search for an effective and
legal method began. So far as
is now known, that search is
still on. In my judgment it
will be fruitless. Some gesture
may be made, but that is all.
