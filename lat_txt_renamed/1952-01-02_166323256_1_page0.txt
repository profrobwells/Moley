The opinion of the author
of this column is that Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy has said
many things that ought not to
have been said but also that
he has said a great deal that
should have been said. He
should be regarded as neither
the arrant demagogue that the
administration says he is nor
the architect of Republican
strategy for 1952,
He has been sufficiently cor-
rect in his criticism of Ameri-
can foreign policy to deserve
a hearing. For that reason, I
have read with care his new
book just published, "Ameri-
ca's Retreat From Victory."
★
This book is an abridged,
edited and expurgated edition
of McCarthy's long speech in
the Senate last June. My
judgment, for what it may be
worth, is that this book pre-
sents an indictment of Gen.
George C. Marshall's part in
the making of foreign policy
in the past decade that will
be very difficult if not impos-
sible to answer. Only here and
there has the Senator from
Wisconsin wandered from the
pathway of the rational to
wield the big stick, and then
the victim is not Marshall but
Acheson. There is practical-
ly no name calling, just
straight history—well organ-
ized and documented.
The rise of George Marshall
to the post he occupied on that
fatal morning of Pearl Harbor
is as amazing as has been his
consistent influence in the 10
years since.
★
The first is almost unbeliev-
able in the light of his med-
iocre attainments before he
moved into the Roosevelt sun-
light. But some light is pro-
vided not only by what McCar-
thy writes but by Robert
Payne, who also has a new
book, "The Marshall Story."
The explanation seems to be
that Marshall attracted Presi-
dential favor because he was
a sympathetic friend and ad-
ministrator of Roosevelt's pet
CCC camps and that Harry
Hopkins became the friend at
court of the general-to-be.
The influence of Marshall
since Pearl Harbor is not so
easy to understand. There can
be no doubt, however, about
the extent of that influence.
★
It was Marshall who suc-
cessfully frustrated Church-
ill's plan to strike through the
Balkans and won Roosevelt
over to the Normandy inva-
sion.
It was Marshall who pre-
vailed over the desire of Gen.
Mark Clark and the British to
move from Italy into Eastern
Europe ahead of the Russians.
He was potent at Teheran,
where the unhappy fate of
Europe was sealed, and still
more so at Yalta, where the
script of the Asiatic tragedy
was written.
He was decisive when Eisen-
hower's forces failed to win
Berlin and keep Austria and
Czechoslovakia.
Even when the error of
these great decisions was al-
ready becoming apparent,
Marshall was given new
worlds to unconquer. He was
sent to China and he delivered
that country over to the Red
Chinese. He returned and con-
fessed failure.
Finally, when failure was
written for all to see in Eu-
rope as well as Asia, the Pres-
ident brought Marshall back
as Secretary of Defense.
All this has been said, writ-
ten and verified over and over.
But there lingers on the mys-
tery of how a man could pos-
sibly rise higher and higher
as failure followed failure. It
cannot be, as McCarthy sug-
gests, that Marshall's policies
were always parallel with the
purposes of the Soviet. That
is incredible.
The fact remains, however,
that these failures in which
Marshall's hand was so de-
cisive have lost us the sub-
stance of victory. And for
them, the people must judge
this unhappy administration
that depended so much upon
the faulty judgment of Gen.
Marshall.
