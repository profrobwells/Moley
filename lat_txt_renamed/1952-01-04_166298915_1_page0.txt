The Tuskegee Institute's
records and research depart-
ment announces that only one
person was lynched in the
United States in 1951. For
years the institute has kept a
careful watch on the subject
of lynching and mob violence,
since this has in the past been
a serious issue in race rela-
tions. Its records cover not
only the South but the entire
United States, and they go
back a great many years.
Fifty years ago, in 1901, the
number of lynchings reached
the sum of 130. Of these vic-
tims of mob violence, 105 were
Negroes. From that year on,
the number rapidly decreased.
The highest number in any
year since 1938 has been six.
Last year, there were two. In
1950, three. In 1949, two. In
1947 and 1945, one each. In
short, this crime has almost
disappeared.
The single 1951 lynching was
in Florida and the victim was
a man named Womack. He
was fatally beaten by a band
of masked men. There is no
evidence in the Tuskegee
record that this crime could
have reasonably been pre-
vented even by the most alert
law enforcement officers.
There was certainly no evi-
dence that law enforcement of-
ficers condoned or connived at
the crime.
Meanwhile, our crime statis-
tics report thousands of mur-
ders of all sorts in all sections
of the country every year, and
the court records show that a
large proportion of them are
never solved.
There is no agitation in Con-
gress, however, to thrust the
Federal government into those
cities where there seems to be
inability to protect the lives
of citizens.
But with the apparent bless-
ing of the administration, Sen.
Humphrey included in his
civil rights bills in June, 1951,
at least two which were aimed
at lynching. The cosponsors
of these bills were Sens. Doug-
las, Benton, Magnuson, Mur-
ray, Neely, Pastore and
Morse. Under the proposed
legislation the Federal govern-
ment would enter the South,
supplant State and local law
enforcement, and punish not
only those committing the
crime of lynching but law en-
forcement officers who fail to
prevent it. The Humphrey
legislation would also have
dealt with "suspected" lynch-
ings, whatever that might
mean.
Such legislation in the light
of the facts is not only unnec-
essary but an affront to States
that have made immense
progress in the development of
law enforcement. It is, of
course, a purely political
maneuver.
