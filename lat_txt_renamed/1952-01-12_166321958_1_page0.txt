The GOP Must Beware
of Losing by Dissension
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At least two, perhaps three
of the past three Presidential
elections were lost because of
Republican dissensions. The
war issue in 1940 swung many
eastern and northeastern Re-
publicans to Roosevelt. Again
in 1944 Roosevelt won because
so many of these same peo-
ple were afraid to change
leaders in war.
And a good case can be
made for the theory that in
1948 Republican differences of
opinion led to wholesale ab-
sences from the polls and
opened the way to a Truman
victory.
That deep fissure in the
Republican Party still exists.
It is underlined by the Taft-
Eisenhower contest. It may
again lead to disaster.

This ought to remind every-
one who wants relief from
Truman and Trumanism that
the forthcoming contest for
the nomination ought to be
conducted with a decent re-
spect for fairness and for ulti-
mate unity. In short, all
concerned should concentrate
on the main issue, which is to
oust the present regime. Both
Taft and Eisenhower sup-
porters should emphasize
points of agreement rather
than disagreement.
I realize that this is advice
that may be lightly taken. The
prize for which politicians on
both sides are contending is
very rich. The ideological dif-
ferences between a Jenner
and a Lodge are very great.
But we are not all Jenners or
Lodges.
The vast majority of Ameri-
cans are middle-of-the-road
folks who want good govern-
ment, less spending, lower
taxes, and a coherent, effective
foreign policy. They want
these whether they attain
them through Taft, Eisen-
hower, Warren, Stassen, Dris-
coll, Dirksen, or any other
good Republican.
The six months before we
know whether the Republican
convention in July will place
before Gen. Eisenhower a
"clear-cut call" is a long time.
A great many hundred speech-
es will be made, and millions
of words will be written.
★
The records of both Taft
and Eisenhower will be
combed over and over. That is
the right and duty of Ameri-
cans who are picking a Presi-
dent. But it will be a tragedy
if, in combing those records,
the differences among Re-
publicans are deepened and
festering sores are opened.
For example, it is most un-
fortunate for Republicans to
say, as I have heard dozens
say, "Taft cannot be elected,"
or, "If Taft is nominated I
will refuse to vote." Nor is it
going to be helpful for Taft
supporters to talk too much
about the deficiencies of Ei-
senhower as a candidate or
prospective President. For
they may have to change their
tune after the convention.
This discord will, of course,
be greatly encouraged by ad-
herents of the Fair Deal. For
Republican discord is their
hope and promise of success.
Let us have a contest with-
out bitterness, and may the
convention be guided by a
sense of duty and national
urgency.
