Our Parks Are Becoming
Drug Peddler's Market
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Not so many weeks ago,
some little girls, the oldest of
whom was barely 9, were sit-
ting on a bench in one of New
York City's smallest but finest
and most expensive parks, on
the edge of the East River.
They were two blocks from
their school, and most of them
were within two blocks of
their homes. One of their
teachers was not far away.
More important, they were
only a few yards from the
mansion of the Mayor and
chief law enforcement officer
of the city of New York. The
Mayor's residence was pro-
tected by plenty of members
of the police force.
Two bobby soxers, perhaps
16 years old, approached the
little girls and offered to sell
them-mind you, sell them-
marijuana cigarettes. The little
girls scuttled away and told
their teacher. The bobby sox-
ers moved on, looking for
more customers.
This incident is not taken
from the newspaper or from
an official report. It comes
firsthand from one of the
little girls. Almost any resi-
dent of New York can tell you
of similar instances. Dope
peddling is all around us in
New York.

My story, however, sug-
gests a grim bit of irony. Why
should we spend our millions
on parks and then fail to
make them safe for the people
for whom they are built?
There are parks in New York
where no woman is safe alone
in the daytime and no man
is safe at night. Why not have
fewer parks, perhaps, and
more policemen? In short,
why not insist that our gov-
ernments do their major jobs
well before they take on
others?
Foremost among the major
responsibilities of government
is the protection of life and
property. After that, govern-
ment performs many desir-
able and reasonable services.
Toward the end of the line
are a great many new things
that are called "welfare."
Common sense should sug-
gest that first things should
come first. Let us have good
bread before we have cake.
Another story, taken from
the newspaper, will enforce
another point in this narcotic
situation. There was revealed
by the police recently the
case of an 8-year-old boy who
was a chronic marijuana
smoker. With this boy's case
as the center of inquiry, the
police found 12 other boys
who were narcotic users.
Their ages ranged only as
high as 16. Eight of them had
the marks of needles on their
arms. They had been buying
their dope from a peddler 10
years of age. This peddler had
capsules of heroin on his per-
son. This stuff he was selling
to the 12 younger users.

The point here is that in
this traffic marijuana ciga-
rettes sell at $3 a package
and heroin at $1 a capsule.
This makes it perfectly clear
that this problem is not
rooted in poverty. It is not a
product of "social injustice."
We cannot blame our econom-
ic system for this one.
The fact is that the more
money there has been in cir-
culation the more this traffic
has grown. That is shown by
a report submitted last week
to the New York Legislature
by Atty. Gen. Nathaniel Gold-
stein. From 1946 to 1949 the
number of known violators
of the narcotic law increased
100%. In 1950 the number in-
creased still more. In 1951 the
increase over 1946 was five-
fold.
No one knows how many
users of narcotics there are in
New York City. A rough esti-
mate by the police puts the
figure at 6000.
The stamping out of this
traffic is a joint responsibility
of the Federal government,
the States, and local authori-
ties. Let us not waste our
energy on new things for
these governments to do be-
fore they do what they now
fail to do.
