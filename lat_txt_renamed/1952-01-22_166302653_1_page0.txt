A Lesson
in History
for Vinson
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman seems to
be much interested in American
history. On many occasions he
has lectured newspapermen on
items from the chronicles of
this country. Now let a member
of the class rise and give him a
lesson from history that he and
his friend Chief Justice Vinson
might well ponder. This bit of
history was suggested to me by
a lawyer in Anchorage, Alaska,
John E. Manders, who had
noted in this column a few
weeks ago some comment on the
present doubtful prestige of the
Supreme Court,

"Way back in 1875, there
were several circumstances in
the national scene which sug-
gest the present. Time was
running out on an administra-
tion infested with corruption.
The Republican Party was
threatened with defeat, and it
sought a fresh and clean per-
sonality as a candidate in 1876.
Political speculation centered
on Chief Justice Morrison R.
Waite, who had succeeded
Salmon P. Chase a little more
than a year before. Waite had
been President Grant's fourth
choice for the post. His first
three raised such a storm that
they were withdrawn. Two of
them were distinctly marked
with cronyism. The other could
not have been confirmed for
other reasons. Finally, Grant
turned to Waite, who was easily
confirmed.
Waite had been a respected
lawyer in Toledo, O., and had
served the government as
counsel at the Geneva Arbitra-
tion. He proved to be one of
the great Chief Justices, for he
successfully steered the court
for 14 years through the shoals
of reconstruction.

When Waite's name was ban-
died about in 1875, as is Chief
Justice Vinson's now, as a
means of extricating his party
from its embarrassment, he
made a clear-cut declaration
which deserves careful reading
in 1952:
"The court is now looked
upon as a sheet anchor. Will
it be if this Chief Justice is
placed in the political whirl-
pool? The office has come
down to me covered with hon-
or. When I accepted it, my
duty was not to make it a
stone to something else, but to
preserve its purity and make
my own name as honorable, if
possible, as that of my pred-
ecessors. My whole educa-
tion and training have been in
line of its requirements. Time
and persevering patience, add-
ed to my habits of work, may
give me honor where I am
...no man ought to take this
place unless he takes a vow
to leave it as honorable as he
found it...
★
"Think of this, my friend. I
appreciate all the kindness of
my friends. But ought not the
Constitution to have provided
that a Chief Justice should not
be eligible for the Presidency?
If such ought to have been in
the Constitution, can I with
propriety permit my name to
be used for the formation of a
political combination? If I do
can I remain at all times and
in all cases an unbiased judge
in the estimation of the peo-
ple? If I am not, shall not I
degrade my office? Put these
things in your pipe and smoke
them and then tell me if I
ought to permit my name to
be used."
This high concept of the sta-
tus of the Supreme Court, es-
pecially of the office of Chief
Justice, has prevailed through
most of our history. Charles
Evans Hughes made it clear
that he would never have con-
sidered the Presidential nom-
ination had he been Chief Jus-
tice.

This lesson has great force
now for more reasons than
one. There is lingering on the
docket of the court the South
Carolina segregation case,
which might create a convul-
sion in the South if decided as
the plaintiff wants it decided.
The question of the respon-
sibility of Justice Clark for the
Caudle appointment has in-
jured the court's prestige.
Justice Douglas' public utter-
ances have not helped.
If the Chief Justice should
now permit himself to be re-
garded as a convenient stand-
in if the President decides not
to run, the court would suffer
still more. If the Chief Justice
values the great office he
holds, he will follow the exam-
ple of Waite.
