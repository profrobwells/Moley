TRUMAN'S
CHOICE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The hint thrown out by
President Truman about the
possibility of his running for
the Missouri Senatorship
brings to my mind a private
prediction which was made
several months ago. The man
who made it must be name-
less here because he does not
talk for personal quotation at
any time.
Suffice it to say that he is a
very distinguished Democrat
who knew Truman very well
indeed when the present Presi-
dent was in the Senate. He
has always been, moreover, an
amazingly shrewd judge of
human character and of po-
litical trends. He said some-
thing like this:
"Harry Truman is not a big
man, but a very proud man.
He will not run for President
this time unless he feels cer-
tain of winning. But he loved
his life in the Senate. There-
fore, if it becomes apparent
that his chances of winning
the Presidency are dim, he
will run for the Senate in-
stead."
*
This prediction was based
upon a number of factors
which might have a bearing
on the President's decision. To
withdraw from the Presiden-
tial contest and run for the
Senate would absolve Truman
of any charge of running away
from a fight. It would tide him
over until 1958, when at the
age of 74 he would be ready
for a comfortable retirement.
It would keep him in the
political atmosphere to which
he has become accustomed
and without which he would
probably wither and die. For
his philosophic nature is not
sufficiently developed to find
enjoyment and deep satisfac-
tion in cloistered retirement
and literary memories. It
might also compromise the
reported wish of Mrs. Truman
that he retire. She would prob-
ably welcome the compara-
tive ease of the Senatorial life.
★
There is another factor
which the President must
realize. He must know that,
despite his optimistic eco-
nomic predictions, the present
boom cannot be sustained in-
definitely. With all due allow-
ance for the delusions which
seem to prevail among his
economic advisers, those
people must know that the
chance of a collapse before
1956 is exceedingly likely.
In the intimacy that must
exist in their relations with
the President this dreadful
possibility must have been re-
vealed. Or if their function
be exclusively that of admin-
istering economic marijuana
to the President, he may have
heard some of the facts of life
from someone else. What is
more likely is that he remem-
bers quite keenly the depres-
sions of the 1920s, for in the
first of those crashes he went
busted himself.
As President, the impact of
such an economic storm would
fall upon him with crushing
force. As a Senator, he could
ride it out.
★
Finally, despite all this
speculation and even if much
of it is true, the demands upon
the President may be so strong
that he will offer himself for
the sake of the party. He is
not only a proud man who will
not like to face defeat, or, even
if successful, loss of face in
a depression, but he is on the
other hand a loyal party man.
And with nobody but such
substitutes as Kefauver and
Stevenson available, he may
respond to the call.
