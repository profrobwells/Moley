The Issue of Too Much
Talent and Too Little
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the two major parties
face a choice of Presidential
candidates, a marked contrast
presents itself. The Republi-
cans are embarrassed by an
excess of available talent and
the Democrats by a deplorable
lack thereof. Both Sen. Taft
and Gen. Eisenhower are sure
to be regarded by impartial
history as outstanding in their
generation.
On the other hand, it is
wholly likely that in 50 years
very, very few Americans will
know who or what were Estes
Kefauver, Adlai Stevenson,
Brien McMahon or Hubert
Humphrey. And it is not like-
ly that Harry S. Truman will
be listed as an illustrious
President.

But to cite Scripture in the
cloudy political setting: "The
race is not to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong . . .
but time and chance hap-
peneth to them all." With the
memory of some past Presi-
dential elections still festering
in our minds, it would be im-
possible to regard anyone,
however undistinguished, as
without hope.
At the moment, Sen. Ke-
fauver and Gov. Stevenson
are, publicitywise, the benefi-
ciaries of the news lull un-
til the end of Presidential
primaries in March. Their
present prominence is further
promoted by President Tru-
man's vague hints about his
intentions, all of which leave
the door open to aspiring
Democrats but still permit a
sizable Truman foot to re-
main therein.
The foremost contender, so
far as a personal declaration
is concerned, is Sen. Kefauver.
His activities seem to have
started two months ago in his
native Tennessee. Reports
from there indicate that the
public meetings intended to
launch his boom were exceed-
ingly frosty affairs. This, how-
ever, has not dampened the
Senator's ardor, for he is en-
tering several primaries.
It is hard to take the Ke-
fauver movement seriously.
His record on domestic issues
places him in the same gen-
eral ideological class as the
President. No really important
legislation bears his name.
He has, however, shown a
tendency toward independence
in his exposure of corruption.
But the sort of crusade that
Kefauver conducted, while use-
ful, was hardly of the nature
that creates Presidential can-
didates. There is always
plenty of sensational stuff to
be brought out by poking
about in the swamps of or-
ganized crime. The revelations
brought to light by Kefauver
were, after all, pretty well
known. They certainly could
not rank with the exposures
that made a political career
for Samuel J. Tilden or
for Charles Evans Hughes.
Nor does the suggestion of
Adlai Stevenson as a candidate
stir the imagination. It is
true that in 1948 Stevenson
ran far ahead of President
Truman and Paul Douglas in
the Illinois election. But in
that campaign it was evident
that Former Gov. Dwight
Green, who was Stevenson's
opponent, was in far deeper
political difficulties than the
other candidates on his ticket.
And the Stevenson record as
Governor elicits no great prom-
ise.

The generally mediocre crop
of possible replacements for
Truman suggests the same
situation as prevailed in 1940,
when Roosevelt had not de-
clared his intention to run
again. The Roosevelt-Truman
regime, successful as it has
been at the polls, has failed
lamentably to develop politi-
cally strong men.
Perhaps that is because one
party has been in power so
long. Perhaps it is due to
poor judgment by the two
people who have held the
Presidential office. In any
event, the Republicans seem
to have the more promising
crop of candidates. Whether
that will be a factor in the
election remains to be seen.
