Here Comes Sir Galahad
on a Whitewash Bucket
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Several surface facts have
gone out from New York to
those who, quite naturally,
never heard of Newbold Mor-
ris hefore last week.
He is a sort of Republican.
He was a member of the La-
Guardia reform administra-
tion. He has an ancestral
name. He was educated as
gentlemen are supposed to he
educated. He is, as used to be
said of Henry Cabot Lodge,
grandpere, of "the very best
butter"—a phrase borrowed
from the sayings of the March
Hare.
This seems to have been
enough to satisfy the publicity
purposes of Messrs. Truman
and McGrath. This fusion Sir
Galahad would shine like a
good deed in a naughty world.
And this might help out until
the memory of past scandals
would fade.
But after the first batch of
items about Morris are made
public, a further fill-in seems
in order.
★
Newbold Morris as a mem-
ber of the LaGuardia admin-
istration was a suitable sub-
stitute for the busy Mayor
at ceremonial occasions. His
job as President of the Coun-
cil was, under the indomitable
and able LaGuardia, without
significance. After the maestro
retired, Morris tried twice to
succeed him through election
but was overwhelmingly re-
jected both times. Democrats
were intent on returning to
power, and most real Republi-
cans in New York do not re-
gard Morris as a Republican
at all. He has reached the end
of his political road in New
York. The Dewey organization
would never support him and,
despite his devotion to the
welfare state, the Democrats
have their own fish to fry.
Ideologically, Morris fits
perfectly the Socialistic at-
mosphere of Washington. For
his real devotion in New York
is to the so-called Liberal
Party, the faith of which
closely parallels the Attlee
party in Britain. He is what is
called, in New York a Park
Avenue Republican. The faith
of this species rests upon two
principles: abroad, Europe be-
fore Asia; at home, prog-
ress by outbidding the Fair
Deal. Park Avenue Republi-
cans would be horrified to join
the Democratic Party, but
they voted to a man for that
party in 1944 and 1948.

Newbold Morris calls him-
self an Abraham Lincoln Re-
publican, which is a designa-
tion carefully designed to re-
move him as far as possible
chronologically from the Re-
publicans of 1952.
All this might be waived
if on the face of it this in-
vestigation promised any-
thing important. To begin
with, Morris has never quali-
fied himself for the genuine
rough-and-tumble inquisition
that is called for. That sort
of thing calls for lawyers like
Hughes, Seabury, Walsh and
Wheeler.
Next, the statements of
McGrath and Morris put to-
gether reveal this to be a
somewhat academic excur-
sion into the paper organiza-
tion of departments, the pa-
per qualifications of employ-
ees, with some comment on
facts already disclosed by
Congress. McGrath's state-
ment shows that he is more
concerned with showing how
many fine and honest men
are working for the govern-
ment than with how many
rascals there are. Morris says
further that he is not going
to prosecute anybody—just
investigate.
★
Finally, a day after his pub-
licity bath in Washington,
Morris admitted that he will
have no power of his own. He
will have no power of sub-
poena. He said: "If I want
something and can't get it I
can go to the President for it."
In short, he will get what the
President wants him to have.
With regard to the power of
subpoena, he made this ridicu-
lous statement: "The power of
subpoena in an investigation
is needed when you want
something from an agency
and can't get it."
This misses the whole point
of what has been going on.
The real low-down on corrup-
tion is not gotten from official
sources but from the rogues
outside the government, some
of whom when hauled before
authority and threatened by
perjury prosecution will
squeal about what has been
going on.
All this is above or below
the comprehension of New-
bold Morris.
