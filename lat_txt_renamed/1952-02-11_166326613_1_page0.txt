MILWAUKEE—No State in
the nation did more to pro-
mote the movement for Presi-
dential primaries in the early
years of this century than
Wisconsin. In no State is this
ritual of selection more zeal-
ously maintained.
But it is clear to candid peo-
ple here, as it is to people
elsewhere, that this great re-
form never justified the hopes
of its promoters. To a candi-
date secure in possession of
his party machinery, the
whole thing is what Truman
said it was—"eyewash.” Nei-
ther Truman nor Roosevelt
before him in 1936, 1940 and
1944 needed to give primaries
a thought. To go into pri-
maries might be an embarrass-
ment. To do so could not be an
advantage.
But old-timers in Wisconsin
who remember the bitter
fights of old Bob La Follette
remember how profoundly it
was believed that Presiden-
tial primaries would revolu-
tionize political life. They were
in those days one way by
which popular leaders hoped
to destroy the “hosses,” abol-
ish “unseen government,” and
usher in an age of resplendent
democracy.
La Follette in Wisconsin
and Hughes in New York
were both sorely afflicted with
boss trouble. They sought
means by which their person-
al popularity might prevail
over the machine. Hughes,
however, never believed in
the extent to which the wide-
open primary was advocated
and enacted in the Middle and
Far West.
Woodrow Wilson went so
far as to say that 1912 might
see the last of the national
conventions. Presidential can-
didates, he said, would come
fresh from the vote of the
people. Never was a prophecy
so wrong. After 1912 this re-
form sickened and finally died.
The great crusade has left us
with 15 varieties of the Presi-
dential primary, none of
which provides a real people’s
choice.
Results in primaries have
only in a very minor degree
played a part in the selection
of the 13 individuals who have
been candidates since 1912. In
some cases the people who
were nominated participated
in no primaries at all. Some
participated in only one or
two. Some did very badly in
the ones they entered.
F. D. Roosevelt, for exam-
ple, was soundly beaten by
Smith in New Hampshire in
1932. At the moment neither
Jim Farley, whom I have just
consulted, nor I can remember
whether he entered any other.
Dewey did well in the pri-
maries in 1940 and lost the
nomination. In 1948 he either
stayed out or did miserably,
except in Oregon, and won the
nomination.
The word “eyewash” is
hardly suitable, but the word
“incidental” or “indecisive”
might be correct. But pri-
maries have a part which is
largely psychological. No
doubt Willkie was induced to
abandon his efforts in 1944
because of his defeat in Wis-
consin. However, he could not
have won the nomination
even if he had won Wiscon-
sin. In 1918 Oregon gave Dew-
ey’s cause a boost, but he al-
ready had assurance of enough
delegates to win. No doubt
Stassen’s defeat there injured
his cause, but his cause was
hopeless anyway.
However, a lethargic elec-
torate, only half of which
cares enough to vote on elec-
tion day, may be reminded by
the primaries that this is an
election year. Perhaps that
raises them above the level
of “eyewash.”
