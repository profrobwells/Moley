In my previous column I
set forth the immense impor-
tance of the so-called fringe
benefits involved in the pres-
ent wage controversy in the
steel industry. In general,
fringe benefits mean payments
into pension funds; insurance,
sickness benefits, and other
welfare payments. These bene-
fits offer such decided advan-
tages to the unions that they
are bound to take an impor-
tant place in most wage dis-
putes.
The public should be
warned, however, that these
benefits are not merely paid
for by the companies con-
cerned, but by everybody. And
a review of the cost of these
items makes it clear that they
are a national economic prob-
lem of the first order.
Fringe benefits have been
increasing by leaps and bounds
in recent years. In 1950 they
amounted to $7,489,000,000.
This was 241% more than the
cost in 1940. It was 16% high-
er than 1949. Moreover, be-
cause these benefits are a form
of compensation that escapes
taxation, the Federal govern-
ment lost through them ap-
proximately $1,900,000,000 in
tax receipts in 1950.
Since we have heard a great
deal from union leaders about
the swollen profits of corpora-
tions, which they presumably
believe to be flowing into the
pockets of rich stockholders,
let us compare dividends with
the fringe benefits paid. In
1950 fringe benefits amounted
to 82% of all dividends paid
by all corporations. And con-
sidering the fact that the gov-
ernment taxes those dividends
and not the fringe benefits,
the amount actually kept by
stockholders was much less.
But these payments are not
evenly distributed among all
businesses. While in 1950 the
rise over 1949 was 16% in all
corporations, it was 55% in
the bituminous coal industry
and 33% in manufacturing in-
dustries.
If this rise of 16% per an-
num continues, it will before
very long amount to that paid
out in wages. If it continues
to rise at that rate for 21
years, it will be close to $200,-
000,000,000, which is as much
as the total personal expendi-
tures of Americans in 1950.
â˜…
The figures for 1951 show
that the 1950 rise was not only
repeated, but increased.
Fringe benefits in 1951 were
18% over 1950.
Younger workers who are
the prospective beneficiaries
of these fringe benefits are
deluding themselves when
they believe that they are
gaining more real security.
For if this form of payment
continues at the present rate
until a worker of 30 reaches
the age of 65, the cost will be
twice today's national wage
and salary bill. This would
produce such inflation that the
pension the worker would re-
ceive would be practically
valueless. And the cost of liv-
ing would have risen to as-
tronomical heights.
It would be an excellent
idea if young workers would
consider the illusion embodied
in these payments. For long
after Philip Murray and John
L. Lewis, who are telling them
that the company and not the
worker will pay, and Harry
S. Truman, who is encourag-
ing this sort of thing, are
moldering in their graves,
these workers will realize the
bitter truth.
