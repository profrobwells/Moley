WARREN IN
WISCONSIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

An almost incredible re-
quest, sponsored by former
Gov. Philip La Follette, that
Gov. Warren run in the Wis-
consin primary raises the
whole question of proxy can-
didates. It also underlines
further that we are witness-
ing the strangest preconven-
tion campaign within the
memory of man.
According to what seem to
be perfectly reliable press ac-
counts, this is what happened
in Wisconsin: Mr. La Follette
called a meeting which includ-
ed several leaders of the old
La Follette Progressive Party,
several supporters of Gov.
Warren, and others favoring
Gen. Eisenhower. Mr. La Fol-
lette himself is a warmly en-
thusiastic admirer of Gen.
MacArthur and four years ago
headed a movement to get
Wisconsin delegates for the
general.
The recent meeting repre-
sented what was called a coa-
lition of Eisenhower, Warren
and presumably MacArthur
supporters. In reality it would
seem to have been an effort
to assemble all available hands
to oppose Taft and Stassen.
One of the people present at
the meeting said that "when
the chips are down Stassen
will be for Taft." This sure-
ly is a new and incredible the-
ory.

Out of the La Follette meet-
ing emerged a warm invitation
to Gov. Warren to be a candi-
date in the Wisconsin Presi-
dential primary, which he has
accepted.
Gov. Warren might have
been well advised to decline
any part in this sort of maneu-
ver for several reasons:
In the first place, it puts
him in the position of merely
trying to stop Taft, rather
than to help himself. Next,
it would provide him with a
group of delegates, if he
should win the primary, who
would not be his delegates at
all. They would, according to
the admissions of some who
were present at the meeting,
scuttle Warren and vote for
Eisenhower. Moreover, the
group, despite its warm invita-
tion, represents such a con-
fusion of ideologies that Gov.
Warren will be at a loss to
know how or by whom he
is being represented.
Finally, and this comment
applies to other candidacies,
the spectacle of a person run-
ning for an office merely to
get support which can be
turned over to another is
neither honest politics nor
convincing to voters. In this
instance it may injure both
Warren and Eisenhower.
★
There will be other proxy
candidates in the forthcom-
ing primaries. Sen. Humphrey
apparently plans to run in
Minnesota to capture the dele-
gates for President Truman.
Most so-called favorite-son
candidates are not candidates
at all.
The suspicion still lingers
that Harold Stassen is not a
serious candidate in his own
behalf. Four years ago, very
unwisely, he permitted it to be
believed that he really fa-
vored Sen. Vandenberg and
only wanted the Vice-Presi-
dential nomination. That may
have been a strong reason
why he made such a poor
showing, despite his energetic
candidacy.
The managers of the Eisen-
hower movement should take
steps to eliminate the ambi-
guity in which their candidate
is slowly being immersed. The
popularity of the general is
being used altogether too gen-
erally to screen a diversity of
ambitions and purposes in
many States. This is good
neither for him nor for the
country.
