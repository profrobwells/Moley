POLLING AND VOTING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the course of the last
three years a very important
fact concerning political polls
has become quite apparent to
me. This point, when thor-
oughly developed, should have
a singularly ironical effect on
public confidence in polls. It
should not only increase con-
fidence in the sampling proc-
esses of pollsters but at the
same time very seriously in-
jure their value in predicting
an election.
To illustrate, let us take
the vote for President in 1948.
As everyone knows, the
predictions of the pollsters
were wrong. They found
Dewey comfortably in the lead
and concluded that he would
be elected. But in that elec-
tion only 48,836,579 voted for a
candidate for President. Ac-
cording to the best calculation
I have been able to make, ap-
proximately 91,000,000 people
were eligible to vote. There-
fore, more than 42,000,000
eligibles did not vote. There
are some differences of opin-
ion about this estimate, but
let us for the present purpose
assume its correctness.

Now there was absolutely
no way for any pollster to
sample only the 48,836,579 peo-
ple who voted. He had to take
the total number for granted.
Therefore, his estimate was
not a test of how votes would
be cast, but of the opinion of
all the people who might
have voted.
We cannot say whether his
polls were incorrect or wheth-
er the method of sampling
was bad. I have, in fact,
reached the conclusion that
the estimate of preferences
for Dewey was probably gen-
erally correct and that if all
the people who could have
voted had gone to the polls,
Truman could not have won.
At any rate, the polls, re-
gardless of the perfection of
their methods, can probably
never be right because they
do not represent a preference
of the people who vote, but
rather of the people who could
vote if they would.
The reasons why I believe
that the Truman vote was
more efficiently mobilized at
the polls are numerous. In
many places, notably in Ohio
in 1950, studies were made of
those who absented themselves
from the polls in 1948. The
results showed quite generally
that the absentees were among
the very people who might
have voted for Dewey.

In one large industrial
plant it was found that a third
of the white collar workers
failed to register and vote. It
may be assumed that the CIO-
PAC had a much better show-
ing than that.
Another piece of evidence
was in the better showing
made by Dewey in States
where more efficient organiza-
tions got out more Republican
votes. These factors were only
contributing causes to the
Dewey defeat, but they were
undoubtedly important.
This serious shortcoming
of the polls should be kept in
mind when we examine the
current preferential polls for
President. In McCallâ€™s maga-
zine for March there appears
a poll of first voters. Eisenhow-
er leads both Truman and
Taft by a wide margin. But
the poll also shows that only
57% of the men and 39% of
the women intend to vote.
This is a shocking confes-
sion by young Americans, to
be sure, but it should also
warn the reader not to assume
that Eisenhower would be
chosen in an election. Before
that could be assumed it
would be necessary to poll
only those who plan to vote.
Polls have their special use-
fulness, but they are not like-
ly to become a reliable means
of predicting an election.
