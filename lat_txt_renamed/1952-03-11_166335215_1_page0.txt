THAT BOOK
ON TRUMAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since the contents of Wil-
liam Hillman's book, "Mr.
President," are now the worst
kept secret of the month and
since publicity has already
been given to some of the let-
ters printed therein, it is in
order to offer here a comment
on two of them.
There will be revealed the
letter written by President
Truman in 1948 to Bernard
Baruch replying to Baruch's
refusal to participate in fund
raising for the Democratic
Party that year and also a let-
ter written to James F. Byrnes
and never sent.
Baruch's letter declining the
request to help in the money
effort is not published in the
book. That, of course, is in
line with the law, for while the
property right to the letter it-
self is with the President, it
cannot be published without
Baruch's consent.
★
But Truman's letter to Ba-
ruch is shown, and nothing the
President has said or done so
clearly shows his unvarnished
concept that he is the govern-
ment, that what the govern-
ment has is his to give, and
that those who receive benefits
from the government are be-
holden to the President and his
personal political machine.
His letter to Baruch ex-
presses disappointment at his
failure to help the finances of
the campaign. Then he adds
that Baruch received many
favors and honors. It is not
altogether clear what all those
favors were, but into the text
following the letter is woven
the suggestion that the Presi-
dent regarded the appointment
of Baruch's brother to a dip-
lomatic post as a favor to B.
M. Baruch himself.
This is one of the most crass
disclosures ever made by a
President. In the first place,
it says in so many words that
"honors" are for sale and that
payment should be made in
campaign contributions; next,
that those honors and favors
belong to the President and
not the nation.
☆
This idea of "the state, it is
I" has clearly captured the
mentality of President Tru-
man. It was shown when he
expressed regret that some of
the officials who were caught
in larceny had "let me down."
They had not let down the gov-
ernment or the nation, but
H. S. T.!
Gov. Byrnes can be counted
upon to care for the alleged
letter never sent "but read"
over the telephone. Byrnes
heard nothing of it at the time.
The comments made by Jona-
than Daniels in his book about
Truman's feelings about
Byrnes must have been in-
spired not by anything that
happened in the official rela-
tions of the two men but by
Byrnes' subsequent outspoken
criticism of the trends of this
administration.
The purpose of a political
mentality like that of the Pres-
ident is always to create a
feeling that the critics of his
policies are prompted not
by principle but by personal
animosity. That is probably
why both the Baruch and
Byrnes' letters are now made
public.
