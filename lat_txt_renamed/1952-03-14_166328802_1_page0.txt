SEN. TAFT SORTS OUT
THE MUGWUMPS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Taft has brought the
word "mugwump" back into
use after a neglect of nearly
25 years.
This is the third period in
which it has come to use in
political life. This word or
some equivalent designation
of a certain species of Republican
is bound to come into
active use as the primary campaigns
grow hotter. And
around its meaning will crystallize
most of the argument
for and against Taft.
Mugwump is not two words,
as was humorously suggested
back in the 1920s by Sen.
Moses, who said that the first
part of the word was on one
side of the fence and the last
part on the other. It had its
origins in the language of the
Algonquin Indians, and it
meant a chief or leader. It
then was adopted by the
blond brothers of the Indians
to mean a distinguished person.
And then Yankee contempt
for such high and
mighty designations changed
it to describe self-constituted,
conceited upstarts.
*
Then it came into use in
its application to reformer Republicans
during the Blaine-
Cleveland campaign of 1884.
In general, the mugwumps of
that year were Republicans
who bolted their party because
of their sympathy for civil
service reform and other "good
government" objectives. Their
efforts were successful in ending
temporarily the dominance
of the party after 24 years.
The mugwumps of the 1920s
were intent upon another kind
of reform. Generally they were
not concerned with matters of
party patronage but with a
more fundamental reform of
the private economy through
government intervention.
They contributed heavily to
the defeat of their party in
1932.
Now Sen. Taft apparently
uses the expression to describe
a group of Republicans who
want to move the policies and
philosophy of the Republican
Party over toward the Truman
policies and philosophy.
Thus they hope to win votes
that have been given to Truman
and Roosevelt and will go
to the Democratic Party again.
â˜…
Those people who do not
want to vote Republican until
the party has made itself a
facsimile of the Truman party
call themselves by the flattering
term "Independent."
They claim to number some
15,000,000. Both claims are
phony. They are not independent
or they would break loose
from their ideological yearning
for Truman's policies. Nor
are there 15,000,000 people
who can be won by moving
the Republican Party to the
left.
The most ridiculous expression
on this point of view is
in a dispatch by a commentator
who says, with that show
of self-assurance always assumed
by those who are not
assured at all, that it is "a
demonstrable fact" that in order
to win the Republican
Party must attract votes that
have always gone to Truman
and Roosevelt.
This cannot be "demonstrated"
because it is not a
"fact." The votes needed by
the Republicans are not among
the 24,000,000 who voted for
Truman in 1948 but among
the 42,000,000 who did not vote
at all.
That is what Taft is saying
and he is right.
