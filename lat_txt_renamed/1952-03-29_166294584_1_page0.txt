When East Meets West
in a Pan Mun Jom Tent
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The mysterious, seemingly
endless negotiations for a
truce in Korea are brought
closer to our minds, If not to
a conclusion, by a letter which
I have received from there—
not, incidentally, from a news-
paperman.
Pan Mun Jom, written that
way or as one word, lies mid-
way between the camp of the
U.N. negotiators and that of
the Communists at Kaesong.
Each is about a half-hour's
jeep ride from the conference
cents. Sometimes during the
winter our own negotiators
used helicopters. The Com-
munist big shots came on the
day described in three sedans,
a 1949 Chrysler, a 1949 Ford,
and a Russian-made car. The
rest of the staff came in Rus-
sian-made jeeps.

Here, let my correspondents
take over:
"The main tent is a fairly
comfortable one, Russian-
made. The chairs are a mix-
ture of Korean and American—
the folding kind used at
funerals. There are five
tables in the big tent, covered
with green flannel and similar
to those in the wardrooms in
Navy ships. The stoves are
United States and the tent is
cared for by our people.
"At about 10 o'clock the
staff, interpreters, and sten-
ographers are waiting in the
tent for the entrance of the
delegates. Then, at the far
end of the room the canvas
curtains push aside and the
Communist delegates come in
—Nam II, Hsieh Fang, Lu,
some unidentified general, and
another Chinese who is
dressed in plain brown with
no distinguishing insignia
whatsoever. Most of the Com-
munists rise, but there is no
movement on the United
States side. (Sometimes this
is reversed, when our side en-
ters first.) Then the U.N.
delegates come in—Joy, Har-
rison, Yu (ROK).

"Nam Il nods curtly to
Adm. Joy. I suppose Nam Il is
a rather handsome man. He
looks like a very hard man.
His background would make
him so. And yet, they talk
about the Oriental, inscrutable
aspect. I fail to see it
here. I've failed to see it many
times, whereas on the other
hand I've yet to see Adm.
Joy break his composure.
(Joy is a remarkable man. I
can think of no one who
might have done this job here
nearly as well.)

"Joy is seated, and there are
several moments before the
paper-rattling is over and Nam
Il speaks. He is seated op-
posite Joy behind the two min-
iature flags—one United Na-
tions, the other North Korean.
Nam Il is well dressed in a
Russian-cut tunic with red pip-
ing around the collar and the
shoulder boards, which are
gold with three white stars
embroidered on them. The
material is olive green. His
breeches are of the same color,
with broad red stripes and
black, polished boots.
"His face has sharp, distinct
features. His attitude is that
of a determined man, although
I've seen him otherwise dis-
posed. I've seen him very
nervous at times and at times
arrogant, although he is usual-
ly quite composed.

"Nam Il is flanked by North
Koreans on his left, Chinese
on his right. Behind them are
the assortment of staff officers
and assistants. He speaks in
brisk, sharp Korean and is
translated by an English and
Chinese-speaking interpreter
who stands behind him when
he is through speaking.
"Joy speaks firmly and de-
liberately.
"After the meeting is over,
the senior delegates return to
their respective camps, leav-
ing the subdelegations to go on
with other items of the agen-
da."
My correspondent mentions
that he was of course only able
to jot down rough notes, since
there was no time for him to
write at length. But out of this
letter one fact comes clear.
There is in the making an-
other national figure of stature
—Adm. Joy. If these negotia-
tions are crowned with suc-
cess, much of the credit must
go to him.
