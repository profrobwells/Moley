THE STEEL
TRUTH
Who Got What?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The figures used in this
piece were not obtained from
the U.S. Steel Corp. or from
the CIO or the government. I
preferred to get my own independently and give my readers
a fair picture of what this industrial giant has earned for
all concerned in its 50 years
of life. Hence, the facts herein were compiled for me by
L. Robert Driver, an independent financial analyst and tax
consultant.
In the first 10 years of its
life, 1902 to 1911, inclusive,
the company's payroll was
33% of sales. In other words,
a third of each dollar taken in
went to employees in all
grades.
★
In the last 10 years, 1942-
1951, inclusive, 43% of the
gross take went to employees.
In the first 10 years profits
were large. They were 24% of
sales. In the last 10 years
they had shrunk to 5.3%.
In the first 10 years accumulated earnings were 7% of
sales. In the last 10 years they
were 1.8%. Thus, there is no
process of hoarding earnings
for some future windfall to
the stockholders.
Now let us take the first
half of U.S. Steel's life (1902-
1926) and compare it with the
second half (1927-1951).
The company has grown in
size. Its sales were 94% higher
in the second half than in the
first half. It paid out to employees increases at a much
greater rate than increases in
sales. In the second half of its
life its payments to employees
went up 119%.
But the amount that must
provide for stockholders—that
is, profits—was 26% lower in
the second half.
★
Meanwhile, the great monster of government grew like
Jack's beanstalk. Taxes were
137% higher in the second
half.
Meanwhile, the claim that
the position of the company
and its stockholders is getting
better and that of the employees worse needs to be exploded. Let us consider the
two years 1950 and 1951: Sales
in 1951 were 1.19 times those
of 1950. Payrolls in 1951 were
1.17 times those of 1950. Taxes
were 1.6 times 1950.
Profits were down. They
were only .85 times those of
1950.
In this vast struggle which
we are witnessing among U.S.
Steel management, the CIO
and a thoroughly political government, the real forgotten
man is the stockholder. He has
furnished the capital. He has
his savings tied up in his stock.
He is getting less and less. He
is not a rich owner. He is
270,000 Americans.
