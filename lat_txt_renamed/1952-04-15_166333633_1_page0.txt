TAFT'S ADVANTAGE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The impact of Taft's three
primary tests, Wisconsin,
Nebraska and Illinois, on
politicians in convention States
far from these battlegrounds
may be very important. It
may ultimately prove to be
a decisive factor in the Taft-
Eisenhower contest.
Last week I had the ad-
vantage of witnessing that
sort of reaction in Arizona,
whose potential in the Repub-
lican convention will be small
but symptomatic. While I do
not attribute any of the com-
ments in this piece to the at-
tractive, popular Governor of
that State, Howard Pyle, I
wish to note that I discussed
the Republican situation with
him at some length.
★
The attitude of Republican
politicians in Arizona is one
of watchful waiting. The
State's 14 delegates to Chicago
will be uninstructed. Some of
them, if not most of them,
have a preference for Taft,
but they are not yet sure just
how strong the current of
public opinion is for Eisen-
hower. I venture to suggest
that if the general's popularity
shows any signs of a decline
the turn to Taft will be hasty
and ardent.
One leading Arizona Repub-
lican put it this way: Taft is
battle tested, has made his
enemies, expressed his con-
victions and shown his
strength and limitations as a
campaigner. He is a known
quantity. He is as real, as
understood as the old frying
pan in the kitchen.

Eisenhower is still political-
ly an unopened gift to Repub-
licanism, like the brightly be-
ribboned package under the
tree on Christmas morning.
Canny politicians everywhere,
like this one in Phoenix, are
waiting for the fateful mo-
ment when the ribbon will be
untied, the tin foil taken off
and the box opened. This will
be the day when D. D. Eisen-
hower, citizen and politician,
without his uniform, will
stand up and make a political
speech.
At that moment, continued
my political friend, Eisenhow-
er had better have a very large
surplus of popularity, for he
is bound to lose a lot. Too
many people of too many di-
vergent views are now sup-
porting him. A lot of these
are going to be disappointed if
not disillusioned. The net of
this man's contention is that
Eisenhower, not Taft, is to be
on trial from now on.
The morning after I left
Arizona the returns from the
Illinois primary came in. The
significance of those returns,
it seems to me, lies in the
weakness of the Eisenhower
write-in vote. Everybody ex-
pected Taft to do well, but few
anticipated such a margin be-
tween the two.
★
This result will not only
strengthen the latent Taft sup-
porters in convention States
but will win over many poli-
ticians who have believed that
Taft could not win.
The Illinois result also raises
an exceedingly important tac-
tical question. If Eisenhower
is nominated could he carry
Illinois? Or Ohio, Indiana, or
Wisconsin? These are indis-
pensable States to the Repub-
licans. The whole theory that
Eisenhower would sweep the
nation, as did the two Roose-
velts, or Harding, or Hoover
in 1928, is now seriously in
doubt. New England, New
York and New Jersey are im-
portant, but the Middle West
is vital.
From here on it is a close
race, with Taft enjoying what-
ever advantage there is now.
