The success of Estes Kefau-
ver in picking up loose votes
in primaries where no one or
almost no one is running
should be a matter of grave
concern to conservative or
even middle-of-the-road Demo-
crats.
Unless they bestir them-
selves, they may find the
Democratic Senator coming to
the convention with enough
support to be a very serious
threat, for he is a younger,
more personable, and probably
more radical Trumanâ€”or to
put it another way, he is a
less academic but equally radi-
cal Wallace.
*
If elected, Kefauver would
probably banish the tainted,
heavy-handed gentry that
moved into the Truman ad-
ministration for purposes of
low, mundane profit. But he
would undoubtedly keep and
cherish that other, more nu-
merous, more astute and vast-
ly more dangerous species,
composed of planners, wel-
fare staters, one-worlders and
bleeding hearts who have
been inherited by Truman
from Roosevelt and who have
proliferated ever since.
Undoubtedly, if he became
President a whole swarm of
people of like mind, who have
been ousted by Truman since
the Wallace days would also
return. These statists are
quite distinct from the gang-
ster element that feeds upon
the slot machine and other
gambling and grafting enter-
prises. They hold themselves
high above such coarse, illicit
stuff. They would not steal
your nickels, but they would,
in the future as in the past
steal something vastly more
important. They would steal
your liberty and impair the
constitutional fabric of the na-
tion. That is the real Kefau-
ver threat.
It should be understood that
the group which is probably
praying for Kefauver is very
articulate. It has all sorts of
publicity outlets, ties with
radical newspaper people,
links with the left wing of the
labor movement and plenty of
free lance "liberal" writers.
Deluded people who call them-
selves "liberal" write admir-
ing stories about the fresh,
new spirit of Kefauver.
*
Since Wallace seems to be
permanently retired to private
life, Kefauver will inherit the
piebald lot that formed the
1948 Progressive Party. Now
that these people see a chance
to capture the big spot on the
ticket or at least to have their
candidate in second place be-
hind some superannuated can-
didate, they are anxious in
their anticipation.
This threat comes because
Kefauver realized the im-
mense value of crime as a
source of publicity. His pere-
grinations as head of the
Crime Committee offered him
a wonderful chance to make
himself known to the nation.
Contrary to every sound prin-
ciple of Anglo-Saxon judicial
procedure, he used television
to expose his wretched wit-
nesses and to reveal himself
as the White Knight of Re-
form.
The amiable but somewhat
scrambled statesman, Sen.
Tobey, tottered along as the
Sancho Panza to the Tennessee
Don Quixote. And Rudolph
Halley planted a couple of
vote seeds which he will har-
vest as the Liberal candidate
for Mayor of New York.
What is needed now is a se-
rious look at the Kefauver
record. What did he vote for
as a Congressman and as a
Senator? What did he say?
What outfits did he sponsor
or join? Where did he stand
on the great decisive issues of
the 1940s?
This candidate must be
taken seriously. He should not
be allowed to win by default.
