A HISTORIC
DECISION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two men must stand before
the bar of public opinion for a
long time to come and bear the
stinging accusation that in a
nation which rests upon the
firm foundation of law they
have chosen other ways to attain their ends. These men
are Harry S. Truman and
Philip Murray.
President Truman has deserved censure because he has
chosen to ignore a wholly adequate legal means of meeting
a problem and has acted illegally. Thus, his offense is
contempt only.
After the ruling of Judge
Pine, it must have been clear
to Murray, as it was to every
literate American, that further measures of legal relief
were available to him. The
case had with Judge Pine
passed only the first step in
the legal roadway. It will be
appealed in the way provided
in our laws and Constitution.
However, contemptuous of
this fact, Murray chose to
bring upon his country what
may be a serious impairment
of its capacity to defend itself.
This will not aid the economic
well-being of the workers to
whom he is responsible. It
will be an economic disaster
for the country. But Murray
chose the way of force and not
of law.
Never in our time and in
our country has a government
official assumed such great
power and at the same time
justified it with such weak arguments as has Mr. Truman
in the case before Judge Pine.
A careful reading of the entire opinion of the judge reveals how utterly unprepared
the government was for this
court battle.
â˜…
Out of it all came the firm
and beautifully stated conclusion of the judge that while
the consequences of a strike
might be serious they could
not possibly be so serious as
to permit a lawless act to go
unchecked and unchallenged.
We can get along with somewhat less steel for articles of
everyday use, but we cannot
have liberty without law.
Harry S. Truman has offered a poor example of respect for law to a generation
that sorely needs it.
