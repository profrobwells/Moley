TULSA, Okla.â€”This is writ-
ten after two weeks in Texas,
during which I got a clear
view of the great battle there
for the control of the two po-
litical parties.
At this stage it seems that
the conservative, anti-Fair
Deal Democrats will prevail
over the self-styled "loyalists."
In the Republican Party a
rush of Eisenhower votes has
greatly outnumbered the old
Republican leaders who were
for Taft. In both cases the
result is unquestionably a fair
expression of popular govern-
ment, and it has been accom-
plished through the once de-
rided convention system.
For those citizens who do
their political duty there is no
better way to exercise influ-
ence than through conven-
tions. They are a real train-
ing in active citizenship. Prop-
erly conducted, they are a fair
way to choose candidates for
office. There are those who say
that when few people care to
exercise their political rights
conventions become the tools
of selfish bosses. The answer
is that no system works when
the public refuses to do its
duty. When apathy prevails,
there are much worse influ-
ences operating in direct pri-
maries than evil bosses.

Forty years ago, when so-
called "progressivism" was
sweeping the country, the con-
vention system was regarded
as an evil center of infection.
The rallying cry was to give
the government back to the
people through direct prima-
ries. And so in many States di-
rect primaries were adopted.
We have now had a good
trial of those primaries, and
that trial has not justified the
claim of the advocates of di-
rect government. The fact is
that direct primaries have con-
tributed heavily to the decline
of the two-party system, they
have made parties less respon-
sible, and in general they have
been unsatisfactory means of
choosing candidates for high
office. What is worse, they
have helped to build up po-
litical mountebanks and dema-
gogues.
I ask any responsible man
to pose for himself the ques-
tion whether Estes Kefauver
has the record, the experience
or the capacity to be the can-
didate of a major party for the
Presidency of the United
States. But by leaping into the
great empty void of the pri-
maries, he has won more than
any other Democrat.

In the precinct and county
conventions in Texas, a clear
choice has been made through
an open and popularly under-
stood and operated device. The
precinct conventions were
very large this year. All rec-
ords were broken, which
shows that when a real issue
is presented and zealous, pub-
lic-spirited leaders get out the
vote, the public will respond.
These precinct conventions
were vastly better exercises
in citizenship than direct pri-
maries, because they required
much more than merely the
dropping of a ballot into a box.
They involved the use of par-
liamentary procedure, public
debate and face-to-face con-
tact with the opposition. In
short, they gave the citizen
more to do.
It should be added that the
law has something to do with
the quality of conventions.
Bad election laws make for
bad and unrepresentative con-
ventions. But in Texas the law
has been thoroughly over-
hauled and in this first test of
the new regulations the result
was good.
Of course, the results of
these early conventions may
be thrown out by subsequent
conventions. But the remedy
for such instances should be
in the courts rather than in a
direct appeal to the people.
The best way to put new
life into the party system
might well be to return to a
new and more popular form of
convention system. Texas
provides the model for this.
