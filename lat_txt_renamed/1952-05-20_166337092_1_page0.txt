Whether Bob Taft is or is
not on the ballot next Novem-
ber, his great campaign in
Ohio in 1950 will have reper-
cussions that will profoundly
influence the result.
The victory of Taft in Ohio
in 1950 was not strictly a party
affair. What made his election
possible was not only his in-
credibly energetic personal ap-
peal, but the development of
citizens' movements in many
parts of the State to instruct
voters and get out the vote.
Thousands of people partic-
ipated in these movements
who had never before in their
lives touched a political activ-
ity.
One of the most significant
of the movements was carried
on by a group under the lead-
ership of Freeman Guerin of
Columbus. They called them-
selves "the active citizenship
league." Guerin says that "In-
stead of wringing our hands,
we decided that ringing door-
bells would be a more effective
way in combating this grow-
ing intrusion into our liberty."
This Guerin idea came to
my attention in 1950, and I
have an account of it in my re-
cent book, "How to Keep Our
Liberty." Guerin seemed to me
to have hit upon one of the
most effective means of over-
coming the threat of Socialism
at home and Communism
abroad by more citizen activ-
ity at the polls. Certainly a
country in which 42,000,000
eligible voters refused to do
their duty in 1948 needs some-
thing to awaken it.
Guerin, who is a conscien-
tious patriot willing to give
time to this highly important
but difficult job, has expanded
his idea into what he calls the
Ohio plan and is inspiring
people in other States to start
similar movements. The idea
has been taken up in Tulsa,
Okla., by a businessman, Opie
Dimmicko. The Tulsa group
calls its movement the citi-
zens' plan. Following the gen-
eral outline of the Ohio plan
the Tulsa movement is dedi-
cated to a nonpartisan effort
to oppose the trend toward
Socialism in our government.
Also following the Ohio
plan, the fight this year will
be divided into three cam-
paigns. This idea, which ap-
parently came from Guerin, is
genuinely original and in-
genious,
First is the red campaign.
That is to get an organization
going, because such a move-
ment needs a lot of able and
public-spirited men and wom-
en to volunteer money and
time.
The next is called the white
campaign. That is the educa-
tional part. It requires an in-
tensive drive to inform people,
by the written and spoken
word, of the issues and the
qualifications of candidates.
The third is the blue cam-
paign. This is the real test.
It will be a grass-roots cam-
paign to get people to register
and vote. For no amount of
propaganda and no amount of
argument can avail unless
people are routed out on regis-
tration and election days. The
vote is the pay-off.
There ought to be thou-
sands of versions of the Ohio
plan in operation this fall. It
seems to me that Freeman
Guerin of Columbus, O., has
started something really
worth while in a perplexing
political springtime.
