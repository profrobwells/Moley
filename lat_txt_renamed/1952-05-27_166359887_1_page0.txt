THE FALSE ASSUMPTIONS
OF DR. GALLUP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It always seemed to me that
George Gallup would be wise
if he concentrated his atten-
tion on his figures and omit-
ted his inevitable interpreta-
tions of those figures.
To be sure, interpretation
is what everybody demands,
and Gallup's business depends
on meeting public demands.
Moreover, the public has an
obsession about prediction,
and many a good man has de-
stroyed himself trying to tear
the veil off the future. Gal-
lup has all but met that fate.
In U.S. News & World Re-
port, Gallup has presented
many of his views and inter-
pretations in the text of an
interview. With many of them
there can be no quarrel. Some,
however, need to be sharply
challenged.
Gallup has always had a
loose way of lumping all peo-
ple into three groups—Demo-
crats, Republicans and "inde-
pendents." It is probably a
fact that the number of peo-
ple who by inheritance and
habit have a real attachment
to either party is, some mil-
lions fewer than the 40,000,-
000 estimate of Gallup. More-
over, a number of people can-
not be nicely separated—
22,000,000 Democrats and 18,-
000,000 Republicans—as Gal-
lup has done.
The fluidity of voters' al-
legiance in the last few years,
when party labels have meant
so little, makes such a division
an absurd oversimplification.
The identity of parties has be-
come more and more blurred.
This, I may add, is un-
fortunate, but it is true. Vot-
ers have made their prefer-
ences on the basis of the per-
sonality of candidates, for-
eign affairs, taxes, or personal
interest. These reasons for
voting one way or another
make a sharp classification by
parties absurd.
Therefore, when Gallup
speaks of the "full strength of
the Democratic Party," he is
alluding to an abstraction.
There is no such thing. There
are probably a few millions
who conceive themselves to
be partisan Democrats and
who will vote for the candi-
date of the party regardless.
But the Roosevelt and Tru-
man votes cannot be regard-
ed in any sense as strictly
Democratic.
One of the greatest fallacies
in current discussions, which
is given full treatment by Gal-
lup, is the concept of the "in-
dependent." Gallup even gives
it numerical proportion. He
says it numbers 15,000,000.
This hypothetical figure is de-
rived from three other hypo-
thetical figures—the 22,000,-
000 Democrats and 18,000,000
Republicans mentioned
above, subtracted from his
guess that 55,000,000 will vote
in 1952.
These so-called "Independ-
ents," he says, take a position
"halfway between the Demo-
cratic and Republican view-
points." Here again is a vague
assumption born of a shotgun
alliance of several other as-
sumptions.
What is the "Republican
viewpoint" or the "Demo-
cratic viewpoint"?
How does Gallup know all
these 15,000,000 "independ-
ents" are really clustered at a
specific halfway point?
How does he know that
they have any concept about
policies that even remotely re-
sembles a viewpoint?
Gallup's own figures in
polls on public issues like
health insurance show that
these people, as well as his
hypothetical Democrats and
Republicans, are mainly dis-
tinguished by a lack of knowl-
edge of the issues themselves.
Finally, the supreme Gal-
lup fallacy is his effort to pre-
dict an election by sampling
not the people who vote, but
the people eligible to vote. In
1948, less than 40,000,000 votes
were cast. There were 90,000,-
000 to 94,000,000 eligible. Some-
thing more than 40,000,000 did
not vote. But Gallup sampled
all the eligibles. His calcula-
tions must forever be based
upon eligibles, not voters.
Maybe he was right in his
samples in 1948, but the peo-
ple he sampled were almost
twice the number of people
who voted.
Gallup's figures can be
scanned with reserved inter-
est. His interpretations, how-
ever, are subject to a heavy
discount.
