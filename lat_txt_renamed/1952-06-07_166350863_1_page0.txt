Now They Know Welfare
Is the Father of Tyranny
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The six opinions of the
Supreme Court justices who
voted against the Truman
steel seizure show how much
water has gone over the dam
since the middle years of the
Roosevelt regime.
Four of the justices in the
majority—Black, Frankfurter,
Douglas and Jackson—date
back to that Roosevelt period.
They were happy laborers in
the New Deal vineyard.
Otherwise, F. D. R. would not
have appointed them. In one
way or another they indicated
their belief in the earlier
Roosevelt reforms. Perhaps
they did not know that
what was happening then
laid the foundations of what
Truman is trying to make
happen now. But now, when
they see the fruit of that early
planting, they recoil in fear
and disapproval.
For they now know that
mild-mannered welfare is the
father of tyranny.
That is the fundamental lesson
of this steel case, and unless
millions of voters learn
what Justices Black, Frankfurter,
Douglas, and Jackson
have learned, and act upon
that knowledge, we shall indeed
witness more of the
harsh reality of tyranny.

Alexis de Tocqueville
warned us of this danger over
a century ago. And in his
strange way Huey Long
warned us 20 years ago.
Tocqueville said that the
enemies of our free institutions
would first appear in
the guise of kind, benevolent
guardians of the people but
later they would shackle us
with rules and regulations.
Huey Long said that when a
dictator came he would first
appear as a friend of the people.
It was a realization of that
inevitable end of the handout
policies of Roosevelt that
caused a good many of us to
pack up and move in the
period from 1935 to 1937.
Messrs. Black, Frankfurter,
Douglas and Jackson should
have known then, but they
lingered on and were rewarded
with high office.
Their warning now is that
you can’t have something for
nothing. If you throw your-
self on the bounty of the government,
you must surrender
your liberty in payment.

Yes, the seeds of Truman-
ism were sown in the middle
years of Roosevelt. It was in
1935 that labor leaders “sold”
Roosevelt their own bill of
goods in the form of the Wagner
Act. In 1936 Roosevelt
openly made a political alliance
with John L. Lewis,
who was then building the
CIO and who then sealed the
bargain with a big campaign
contribution. Later, the Lewis
CIO sit-down strikes were
tolerated by the President.
And so things went on to
the point under Truman when
the junior partner of this alliance
used an emergency to
take the upper hand. Philip
Murray for a moment was
master of the President.
We must warn ourselves,
over and over, that we cannot
have something for nothing.
The wages of state welfare is
the tyranny of the state.
These justices have done us
a great service. They have
shown us how dangerous power
can be in the hands of a
President. We should, now
that a new President is to be
chosen, select one who realizes
that no one is above the law.
