REPORTERS'
CHANCE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The political reporter, who
for many years has been an
unsung hero, has in this very
important year 1952 a match-
less opportunity. He is appear-
ing in print, on the radio and
in television with the leading
statesmen of the land. But by
and large he will have to
sharpen his wits and improve
his manners if he is to realize
the full fruits of this match-
less opportunity.
The old-fashioned political
speech is under what may or
may not be a temporary shad-
ow. To begin with, mechanical
means of dissemination have
put all but the most accom-
plished performer at a great
disadvantage. There is noth-
ing exciting about looking at
the average politician as he
reads a speech. That is par-
ticularly true since television
brings the speaker so close to
the viewer and listener.
★
The dreadful truth emerged
as we saw a man who was
supposed to be the very mir-
ror of winsome charm speak-
ing at Abilene. The picture
brought to us was that of a
nervous, harried man throw-
ing out his words in sharp
and rasping barks.
Taft's barks may be worse
than his bites but he never
delivered a speech so badly as
did Eisenhower in Abilene.
The great appeal of the
Bryans and the La Follettes of
another generation was that
they were not near us and
that they could act as well as
speak. A battery of micro-
phones and a written speech
would have shorn away most
of the effects of oratory.
★
Another and more impor-
tant reason for the decline of
the political speech is the fact
that the practice of ghostwrit-
ing has made cynical listeners
of almost all of us. Few peo-
ple believe that a written
speech by a major candidate is
an authentic product of the
speaker's own brain.
The praise, if any, is be-
stowed upon the unknown
writer and the blame, if any,
is directed at the person who
delivered the speech or at his
managers. Only the develop-
ment of the art of extempo-
rizing can rescue the formal
political speech.
★
This decline in the art of the
formal speech has brought the
press conference to the fore.
It is, properly conducted, an
admirable way to test a can-
didate, to provide the public
with a measure of the issues
as well as of the men among
whom they must make
choices. And the multiplica-
tion of television shows built
upon the press conference
brings them to millions more
than through other media.
Sunday has come to be the
big day for those shows and
their importance is recog-
nized by the fact that their
content often becomes front-
page news on Monday. Those
reporters and editors who par-
ticipate have a grave but a
glittering opportunity to do
something not only for them-
selves but their profession. I
watch these shows because it
is clearly a part of my busi-
ness, as a journalist, to do so.
★
"Meet the Press" is, in my
judgment, the best of them.
My description of its virtues
will be my way of indicating
what most of the other pro-
grams sadly lack.
It has dignity. Distinguished
interviewers are treated with
respect. There is no confusion.
Miss Rountree knows how to
distribute the time for the
questioners and to cut short
those who try to monopolize
things. The management of
the show selects reporters who
know their stuff and know
how to behave themselves.
The questions are sharp but
designed to be the means of
eliciting pertinent informa-
tion. Mr. Spivak sets a pace
for these which is admirable.
★
But there are on other
shows too many irrelevant
questions. Also there are rude,
unfair and insulting
questions. A prize example
was a question addressed to
Gen. Wedemeyer recently. In
substance it asked him what
job Taft offered him for his
support. This was an allega-
tion of a criminal act. It was
also indescribably bad man-
ners. People just don't ask a
distinguished man like Wede-
meyer such a question.
These breaches of manners
and intelligence crop up in
press conferences such as
those held by Gen. Eisenhow-
er. They are injurious to the
press. They are throwing a
baleful light upon the whole
profession of journalism.
