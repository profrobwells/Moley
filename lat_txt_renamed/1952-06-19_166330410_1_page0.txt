Eisenhower has now made
an inspired decision that will
do a lot to bring about the de-
cline of the set political speech
and the demise of the ghost
writer.
Confused by the pulling and
hauling of impractical, in-
competent and misguided ad-
visers, he decided before mak-
ing his Detroit speech that he
would toss all this canned stuff
out the window and go on his
own. He could have done noth-
ing that would win him more
friends. He could have done
nothing that would so elevate
the standard of political de-
bate. This act of his comes like
a fresh, cool breeze in the hot,
fetid atmosphere of precon-
vention politics.

This phony business of
ghost-written speeches has be-
come almost universal prac-
tice not only in politics but
in business and elsewhere. It
has, in fact, become so phony
that a long-suffering public
has become wholly cynical
about it and pays little at-
tention to written speeches.
It is time to bring it under
sharp challenge and there
could be no better way to show
how bad it is than to outline
the situation in which Eisen-
hower found himself and from
which he delivered himself by
deciding to go on his own.
Part of my story is by pretty
clear inference from what
was told in the newspapers
about the general's visit to
Detroit. Part is from what was
written in a New York paper
by a correspondent who seems
to have been very close to the
group around Eisenhower. A
part is from my personal
knowledge.
A bit of proof is the fact
that that correspondent who is
very intimate with the eastern
crowd which has been man-
aging Eisenhower has a
strange conception of geogra-
phy. His knowledge of the
Middle West is indeed like that
wry bit entitled "The New
Yorker's Map of the United
States." He wrote that Gen.
Eisenhower after his arrival
in Detroit "figuratively" de-
cided to toss his ghost writers
into Lake Erie. It must have
been figurative or the general
must be a super Paul Bunyan.
For Lake Erie is, as the ghost
writer files, some 20 miles
from Detroit. The body of wa-
ter that must have confused
this correspondent is the De-
troit River.

At any rate Eisenhower,
with several drafts to choose
from, decided to reject them
all and speak extemporane-
ously. These drafts according
to, that correspondent were
from three or four widely di-
vergent people. One, or a part
of one, was from Paul Hoff-
man, who can hardly be re-
garded as an experienced poli-
tician. Another was from a
man who has been with the
general since he left the Pen-
tagon, also a political novice.
A third was from a man who
did the chief ghost writing for
Gov. Dewey's unsuccessful
runs in 1944 and 1948. Before
that this man did similar serv-
ice for Wendell Willkie in
1940. One can hardly imagine a
person so perfectly educated
in the art of losing an elec-
tion.
In fact, the prominence in
the Eisenhower advisory
group of people who have
helped lose three straight elec-
tions reminds me of an old
story of a grateful widow. She
published in her local paper a
note running something like
this:
"I wish to extend my thanks
to all those who assisted at
the death of my late husband."
All this gets very confusing.
And I may add most amusing.
It is, however, sufficiently
important to deserve further
treatment. Therefore I shall
continue it in my next column.
