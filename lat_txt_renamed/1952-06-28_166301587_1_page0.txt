Whoever the Candidate,
Truman Will Run, Too
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
More and more people are
saying that Truman will run
again. Nobody can answer that
now. Probably even Truman
himself can't. But whoever
runs will have Truman as the
center of the stage and Tru-
manism as the issue.
And opinion seems to be di-
vided as to whether Truman
will prove to be a magic car-
pet or a millstone. In my opin-
ion the latter will prove true.
Everything that the Presi-
dent is saying indicates clear-
ly that he is looking to this
election to prove that the
people are willing to over-
rule the Congress and the Su-
preme Court and sustain his
actions in the steel contro-
versy.
Truman's temper in this
matter is of immense national
importance. For as he obsti-
nately refuses to enforce the
law he is bringing a crisis
nearer and nearer.
That crisis may live on in
history as a tremendous test
whether a minority leader in
alliance with the President can
enforce his will not only upon
an industry but upon two of
the great branches of govern-
ment. For both Truman and
Philip Murray have clearly in-
dicated that if the injunctive
provisions of the Taft-Hartley
Act are invoked they will be
violated. Beyond that is the
power of the courts to punish
for contempt.
At that point Murray is some-
what noncommittal. At that
point Truman will hope that
he will not be an active factor.
Perhaps he will step aside and
tell the courts that they can
enforce their own contempt
decrees. If Murray continues to
defy the law he will say that
the chaos that results is not of
his making and that he gave
ample warning.
It is easy to see, however,
how large this issue will loom
in the campaign and what a
burden it will place upon the
Democratic candidate whoever
he may be. The President will
be making speeches for him
and incidentally in defense of
himself. The Democratic can-
didate cannot disown the Pres-
ident or disavow his actions.
In fact that Democratic candi-
date will not be a candidate
unless Truman wants him to
be. For the President will
dominate the convention and
dictate the nomination and de-
termine the character of the
platform.

Meanwhile, it may be ex-
pected that a more or less law-
abiding electorate will develop
a deep resentment toward the
actions of Murray and his
lieutenants. They can hardly
be indifferent to an open de-
fiance of the Congress, the
courts and the law, for these
agencies of government are
the only protections that we
have against primeval chaos.
If a heavy fine is levied upon
the union and Murray, the
steelworkers will not feel any
too kindly toward Truman.
For they will say that it has
been the assurances of Tru-
man all along that has in-
duced them to take the various
actions that have character-
ized the last few months.
Perhaps before the Demo-
cratic convention assembles
on July 21 some sort of set-
tlement will save Truman and
the leaders of the union from
all this. But if the strike con-
tinues the resulting economic
situation will be very bad in-
deed. It will overshadow every
other domestic question and
will hang heavily in the inter-
national sky. There are Demo-
crats like Harriman or Kefau-
ver who would take the nomi-
nation under any conditions.
But such a prospect might
well deter a man like Steven-
son, who would rather be Gov-
ernor of Illinois than a de-
feated candidate for the Presi-
dency.
But whatever happens noth-
ing will deter Truman. He will
do the whistle-stopping and he
will be the issue.
