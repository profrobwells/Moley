THE HUBBUB
REMAINS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Nearly half a century ago,
a Russian named Ostrogorsky
wrote what is still probably
the most comprehensive study
we have of political parties in
England and the United
States. It is called "Democracy
and the Organization of Polit-
ical Parties." His classic de-
scription of our national con-
ventions has been read by a
generation of college students
of government and has been
the source of great indignation
and of resolutions to find a
better way of nominating
Presidents. But after all these
years this institution still re-
mains, with all its disorder
and sharp practice and unbridled
emotion.

Students who read Ostro-
gorsky have grown up and
have taken rank among the
noble and wise of the land.
But no one has been able to
do much about the convention
or to find a better way to
nominate a President.
Meanwhile, radio and tele-
vision have appeared and
have brought the unhappy
reality of the convention to
the great public. But nothing
has happened.

I well remember listening in
1924 to what was to me the
first broadcast of a convention
in a club in Cleveland. It was
the long fight in New York be-
tween Smith and McAdoo. A
sharp-minded political reform-
er who was present spoke up,
"This is the end. Once the
people can hear this stuff
over the radio they will abol-
ish this thing."

That expression of faith
in the people was ill-founded.
It was a naive belief shared
by the progressives of that
and of earlier days that indig-
nation might beget wisdom.
The Presidential primary
came into being to supplant
the convention. Even Wood-
row Wilson believed that 1912,
or thereabout, would see the
end of conventions. He was
wrong.

If I go back and read
Ostrogorsky, I find a germ of
what may be the reason for
the convention's durability.
A long and vivid descrip-
tion of the convention ends,
with this comment, on a very
significant note:
"Yet, when you carry your
thoughts back from the scene
which you have just wit-
nessed and review the line of
Presidents, you find that if
they have not all been great
men—far from it—they have
all been honorable men; and
you cannot help repeating the
American saying: 'God takes
care of drunkards, of little
children, and of the United
States.'"

At this point, when I was
teaching a long time ago, I
used to end the quotation. It
is the way of young teachers
to be irreverent and, I may
add, often irrelevant. Also to
be dramatic. Something, per-
haps the wisdom of years,
prompts me now to continue
Ostrogorsky to the end:

★

"On second thought you
find, of course, some earthly
saving power. That is the
power which resides in the
people who will not vote for
an objectionable man. The
fear of the people is the begin-
ning of the wisdom of the poli-
ticians."

Think of that as you witness
and hear this show. Back of
it, is much more calm reason
than is given to most human
decisions. These delegates are
not all fools. They are seek-
ing a wise choice because
they are seeking to win for
their party.
