THE HOUSE
DIVIDED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Somewhere in last week's
sea of oratory, in which the
memory of most of us is still
swimming, there was mention
of Lincoln's adaptation of the
scriptural line about the house
divided against itself. In fact,
that may have been the most
significant line spoken all
week because it was so true.
The allusion is, however, a
gross understatement because
it implies a division into only
two parts. The Republican
Party is a house in which
many divisions run in all di-
rections, crossing and recross-
ing each other in an infinite
variety of forms and shapes.
Unless there can be found
some simple common cause
such as a need for a change,
this house so terrifically di-
vided cannot stand.
The schism over foreign pol-
icy is the better known of
these divisions. That one stems
from several sources, however.
There is, of course, propinqui-
ty. The eastern seaboard is
closest to Europe. In both
world wars, before the United
States became a participant
one could feel keenly the im-
pact of conflict in New York,
but in Columbus or Indianapo-
lis it was something remote.

Another root cause of di-
vision is financial. This one I
never appreciated until in
1932 and 1933 I was given
some authority by Roosevelt to
deal with the debts owed to
the United States by various
European countries. My own
position on the subject of can-
celing these debts ran close to
that of Coolidge: "They hired
the money, didn't they?"
I suddenly found that forces
emanating from Wall Street—
and I mean Wall Street—were
exercising powerful influences
to drive a wedge between me
and the boss. Inspired stories
appeared in print about my iso-
lationism. I was, in fact, only
trying not necessarily to col-
lect, but to keep the debts alive
as a reminder to us not to
lend too soon again. But so
long as the debts stood, the
European market for interna-
tional bankers was cramped,
and they wanted desperately
to resume a very profitable
trade.
The tariff has perennially
been a dividing line. Here
again eastern financial inter-
ests have wanted to lower tar-
iffs, but certain major indus-
tries and large segments of ag-
riculture have always demand-
ed protection.
The Far West looks to Asia;
the East views Asia as a region
east of Europe.

In the field of domestic pol-
icy there are dozens of dif-
ferences. Gov. Dewey, with his
eyes on New York City, is
strong for civil rights legisla-
tion. Some candidates for
President have taken a simi-
lar position. Old-time Republi-
cans with their eyes on the
past want their party to stick
to the force bills of the 1870s.
Border-State Republicans
would ease up the drive for
Federal legislation. Mean-
while, the Republican Party
in the South remains a with-
ered limb.
Most important is the di-
vision, which will dangerous-
ly imperil the party chances
this year, between those who
want a "hard-hitting cam-
paign" and those who would
go halfway to the Fair Deal.
This division tortured Dewey
in both of his campaigns. His
advisers clashed, but he end-
ed by accepting the soft course
and thereby lost the election.
If in the face of all these
divisions we can have a Re-
publican victory this year, it
will be because of the over-
whelming demand of the peo-
ple for a change. But it will
take strenuous efforts to win
on that issue alone.
