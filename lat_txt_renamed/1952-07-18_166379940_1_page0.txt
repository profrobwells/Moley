The moment, It seems, has
arrived to quote a man who
for many years has kept his
silence on Democratic affairs.
That man is the former Vice-
President who served the first
two terms under President
Roosevelt, John Nance Garner.
"Mr." Garner, as he is
called, even by his own son, is
living in quiet retirement at
his home in Uvalde, Tex. He
is 83 years young. He reads
copiously and his clear, high,
strong voice, so well known in
Washington for nearly 40
years, is as good as ever. His
mind is sharp and his expres-
sions of political, philosophy
are rich and wise.

On April 30 I paid my an-
nual visit to him at his home.
He talked of many things and,
finally, the subject of the next
Democratic Presidential candi-
date came up. A year before,
when I saw him, he had made
the shrewd prediction that
President Truman would not
run again. A month before my
visit this year President Tru-
man had verified the Garner
prediction.
In our discussion the name
of Vice-President Alben Bark-
ley came up. Then, much to
my surprise, Mr. Garner said
that I might quote him, when-
ever I thought it wise, that he
considered Barkley "the best
qualified and the logical man
to cement the Democratic
Party." It seems to me that
this is the right time to take
Mr. Garner at his word. There
is a large amount of evidence
and logic to support the Gar-
ner opinion. But before I men-
tion that permit me to dispose
of the quick reaction of the
reader that "he is too old."
Yes, Barkley will be 75 on
Nov. 24: Most men would avoid
the Presidency at such an age,
younger than Winston Church-
ill. There are many instances
of men older than Barkley
who have successfully admin-
istered the affairs of state. He
says he feels well and wants
the job. And he seems to be
all right.
The clinching answer is po-
litical. Delegates to the Demo-
cratic convention indicated
in 1944 that they were not
much concerned about actu-
arial matters. Their rule is to
nominate a man for the Presi-
dency who can be elected and
a Vice-Presidential candidate
who can take over "if, any-
thing happens."
There are many other
shrewd Democratic politicians
who not only agree that
Barkley is "best qualified"
but who believe that he will
be the nominee. I am, how-
ever, concerned with availabil-
ity, not prediction.

No one in sight could so
conclusively prevent a south-
ern revolt. Remember that
those who will control the ac-
tions of most Southern States
are Senators or former Sena-
tors. And no one in a genera-
tion has been more loved and
respected than Barkley in the
Senate. He comes from a bor-
der State. He is neither ultra-
left nor ultraright. He knows
more about government than
all the rest of the possibilities
combined. Why not Barkley?
Alben Barkley
and there may he enough dele-
gates who believe he is too old
to block his nomination. But
there are other considerations,
some of which are rational
and some of which are mere-
ly political.
He is, after all, three years
