It's a Political Campaign,
Not an Entertainment
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

I think it was Henry Menck-
en who said that capacity to
make a speech should no more
be taken as a means of judg-
ing a person's capacity to hold
public office than ability to
play the fiddle. In short, that
oratory and music are both
arts which could be mastered
by people who are utterly un-
suited to the task of govern-
ing. There is a great deal of
truth in this.

It needs to be pointed out
with special emphasis this
year, when television has add-
ed another element of the
dramatic art to the require-
ments of a candidate. If we
go on like this, candidates will
be required to show proficien-
cy in still other arts, such as
dancing. And the fate of
nations may be determined by
someone's ability to do the
rumba. In fact, some Gover-
nors and Congressmen have
been elected for reasons no
more valid than that. And
the welfare of the common-
wealth was certainly not pro-
moted by their service in of-
fice.

I can discern in some of the
writing of my fellow crafts-
men in the field of journalism
a tendency to forget the gold-
en nugget of truth in Menck-
en's comment. The relative
claims on the electorate of
Eisenhower and Stevenson
seem to be weighed by some
in scales intended for literary
and drama criticism rather
than political and govern-
mental science.

And if that be the measure
by which the voters can be
led to make their decision in
November, then may Provi-
dence have mercy on this re-
public. For as an oratorical
contest or a literary competi-
tion the cognoscenti seem to
be leaning to the wordsmith-
ery and jokes of the Gover-
nor of Illinois.

This was especially true of
the reaction of some to the
speeches of the two candidates
at the plowing contest in Min-
nesota. As literary produc-
tions, the two speeches were
hardly comparable. Eisenhow-
er's lacked the smoothness,
the unity, coherence and em-
phasis of which the rhetoric
books speak. But, carefully
combed for substance, the
Eisenhower speech makes the
better impression.

There is, of course, a large
measure of irony in the fact
that the preconvention sup-
porters of Eisenhower are
hoist with their own petard.
They were saying then that
while Taft had great qualities
of statesmanship he lacked
the finesse and color which
might make a successful can-
didate. The assumption was
that the General had these
qualities in a superlative de-
gree. Now they must, in fact
all Republicans must, say that
the qualities of dramatic ap-
peal and the like are not im-
portant. They have discovered
that while the General has
great qualities the capacity to
project those qualities on the
stump is not among them.
Taft is now needed to add the
element of fierce competition.
The Republican cause will
need thousands of workers to
carry to the voters of the
country the message of what
this election means in the seri-
ous terms of statesmanship.
And high among the lessons
that they should teach is this:
This campaign is not a show or
a game; it is a great solemn
referendum on issues which
may well determine the future
of the United States.
