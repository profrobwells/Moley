Adlai Prefers a Pretty
Phrase to Consistency
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Democratic candidate's
California composition on how
to work for peace belongs to
a sophisticated art in which
consistency may be a threat
to the easy flow of words.
When a pretty phrase sug-
gests itself, it must be turned,
even though in the preceding
paragraph a phrase was
turned which is a flat contra-
diction.
As an example, note that at
the beginning of the San Fran-
cisco speech Stevenson chid-
ed the Republicans for being
worried about world affairs.
He said: "The worried atti-
tude of some Republican lead-
ers troubles me almost more
than their policies." And then,
about five minutes later, he
said: "America is threatened
as never before."
★
The reason it is threatened,
he said, is that "the idea of
personal freedom" is having
trouble reconciling itself with
"personal subordination to
the state."
So he really does recognize
that Marxism is dangerous?
But in a previous speech he
had a fine joke sneering at
people who speak of the dan-
ger of Socialism, "creeping or
galloping."
He would explain this by
saying, perhaps, that Social-
ism in the United States is
nothing to be afraid of, espe-
cially when a Democratic
President is in office. In short,
when steel or agriculture is
nationalized by Attlee or Stal-
in, there is a danger, but when
Truman threatens either of
these things people should not
be perturbed.
★
But the really alarming
feature of Stevenson's speech
was its soft touch toward
Communism. This is the most
significant part of the speech:
"There is an important dif-
ference between Communism
as we view it and Communism
as some of the Asian peoples
view it. When we think of
Communism we think of what
we are going to lose. When
many of the Asian peoples
think of Communism, they
think of what they are going
to gain."
We should, therefore, ac-
cording to his argument, pon-
der upon this and try to un-
derstand it. This passage has
its counterpart over and over
in the writings of Lattimore
and other sponsors of the idea
that the murderous war lords
of China were only agrarian
reformers.
★
There is no recognition of
the fact that there was an-
other way to show our sym-
pathy for the legitimate as-
pirations of Asiatics than to
deliver, as we did, the peo-
ples of China over to a band
of bloody tyrants trained in
and directed by Soviet Rus-
sia. The Chinese people were
pawns in this game. They
were not thinking much about
the promise of Communism at
all.
Another feature of the Ste-
venson thinking sharply fol-
lows the policy of appease-
ment practiced these past 10
years by the administration
of which he hopes to be the
receiver. It is the accent he
gives to winning by giving to
India and other Asiatic peo-
ples.
★
The building up of the power
of Japan, Formosa and other
bastions is only slightly
mentioned. The word "Japan"
appears only once, despite the
fact that Japan means more to
the future security of the
United States than all the rest
of Asia. Perhaps his studied
avoidance of Japan is because
it was Gen. MacArthur who
won the friendship of that
country after leading its con-
quest in war.
Finally, there is no defense
at all of the succession of mis-
takes that brought about the
Asiatic tragedy. He calls such
matters mere partisan rancor.
That is the standard Fair Deal
philosophy. Ignore the past,
especially the recent past.
