A PARTY'S
GUILT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Twice now, in Chicago and
in Los Angeles, Candidate
Stevenson has referred to
Charles Evans Hughes' fa-
mous alibi for the crooks in
the Harding administration.
In his latest reference he of-
fered this quote from Hughes:
"Neither political party has
a monopoly of virtue or rascal-
ity. Let wrong be exposed and
punished, but let no partisan
Pecksniff affect a holier-than-
thou attitude. Guilt is person-
al and knows no party."

Despite the greatness of
Hughes' over-all contribution
to the public life of his time,
he had his moments of pure
partisanship and his contribu-
tions to the literature of un-
adulterated sophistry. This
statement was one such devia-
tion.
Indeed, when it was ut-
tered in 1924 it was denounced
by some of the very intellec-
tuals who are now supplying
smart stuff for the Stevenson
speeches. Of course, those peo-
ple were then opposing Cool-
idge, whom Hughes was sup-
porting. But in the present
instance Stevenson can seize
this, with other alibis, to coun-
ter the attack upon the corrup-
tion of which he hopes to be
the receiver.
The indirect rebuttal to the
Hughes-Stevenson theory is
that if a party claims credit
for the good things that hap-
pened, it must accept blame
for the bad. If Stevenson
wants to get credit because
business is prospering, he
should not be permitted to
escape the loss of votes be-
cause the Truman administra-
tion has been found guilty of
harboring crooks, fixers and
men of shady habits and low
standards.

But there are more direct
and positive answers to the
Stevenson sophistry. It has
been revealed that the Demo-
cratic Party, as a party, has
been the conscious recipient
of the wages of sin.
Sen. Williams, in April of
this year, revealed that near-
ly half a million dollars in con-
tributions to the New York
State Democratic Committee
were permitted by the Inter-
nal Revenue Bureau to be
treated as "loans," 90% there-
of to be written off as bad
debts on income tax returns.
Is this or is this not the use
of the power of government to
aid a political party by dubi-
ous methods?
Also, consider the case of
Robert Hannegan, under
whose administration of the
Internal Revenue Bureau
there were appointed six of
the eight collectors who were
involved in the bureau scan-
dals. The bureau was regard-
ed as a happy hunting ground
by Democratic Party poli-
ticians.
★
Note the dual relationship
of Hannegan to the Demo-
cratic Party and to the Inter-
nal Revenue Bureau. Hanne-
gan was chairman of the Dem-
ocratic Party in St. Louis until
1942, when he became collec-
tor in that city. The next year
he moved to Washington to be
commissioner. The next year
he became chairman of the
Democratic National Commit-
tee and played a big part in
nominating Truman for Vice-
President. Then he became
Postmaster General.
In the light of this Hanne-
gan story can anyone in his
right mind who is not, as is
Stevenson, running for office
say that the Democratic Party
can escape responsibility for
what happened in the Inter-
nal Revenue Bureau?
If so, consider the reluc-
tance of the administration to
fire Finnegan, the collector in
St. Louis.
Then consider the case of
William Boyle, who succeeded
Hannegan as chairman of the
national committee.
★
Unless a political party is
willing to accept the very seri-
ous trust of filling offices and
administering government as
a responsible agent, it should
not be voted into power and
its candidate should not be
elected. If it seeks to take
such a trust on the dubious
condition that if its appointees
do badly it will not be blamed,
it should not be entrusted with
power.
Stevenson cannot have it
both ways. Either he is the
responsible head of a respon-
sible party or he is not.
