A STRANGE CAMPAIGN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the memory of this oh-
server, this Presidential cam-
paign must be marked down
as the strangest of all. Almost
anything can happen. but the
most likely is that Taft and
Truman, rather than the can-
didates, will now become the
centers of public interest.
ple were saying that they
hoped the contest might be
between Taft and Truman.
That seemed logical, because
it was to be the Truman ad-
ministration that was to be
on trial, and Taft had been its
ablest and most constant critic.
That hope is in a measure now
to be gratified.
To a degree, both parties, in
nominating Eisenhower and
Stevenson, were trying to es-
cape responsibility for their
own records. Instead of nom-
inating the people who were
most clearly identified with
those records, they nominated
two men who could deny rela-
tionship to past political
events.

In fact, the major argument
for Eisenhower was that his
party affiliation had been so
vague that Democrats as well
as Republicans could vote for
him. His views on the vital
issues of the day were almost
wholly unknown. With him as
a candidate, it was said, the
Republican Party could begin
a new life.
Ever since Eisenhower has
been clarifying his views, he
has been losing the enthusias-
tic support of people who, a
few months ago, declared him
to be indispensable. Certain
columnists who were ardent in
their praise before the Repub-
lican convention are now com-
plaining about Eisenhower's
conservatism.
Stevenson was undoubtedly
the choice of the Democratic
delegates because he could and
would deny any ties to the
Truman administration. His
supporters argued that he
would destroy the best issue
of the Republicans, which was
the need for a change. "With
Stevenson," they said, "we can
have a change without chang-
ing parties."
The utterances of both can-
didates until September were
wary and tentative. Eisenhow-
er refused to attack the Presi-
dent, and Stevenson referred
to Eisenhower only obliquely.
Neither offered a very positive
program. Neither aroused the
enthusiasm normally accorded
a candidate.
★
It was thus made almost in-
evitable that Truman and Taft
should come to the center of
the stage. Shrewd Democrat-
ic politicians have been com-
plaining for a month or more
that Stevenson's stuff was
over the heads of the voters.
They demanded the emer-
gence of Truman with his
salty appeals to prejudice and
emotion.
And Republican politicians
longed for Taft with the in-
tensity that recalled Welling-
ton's prayer at Waterloo:
"Blucher or night!"
Now it seems that these
hopes are to be fulfilled.
For the real question for
voters to decide is whether the
Truman administration has
been a faithful trustee of their
governmental affairs. It is, as
Truman says, the Truman rec-
ord that is on trial. He is the
one who should defend it.
And Taft represents the real
opposition to the Truman re-
gime.
From here on, we shall be
hearing more interesting
things on the political front.
