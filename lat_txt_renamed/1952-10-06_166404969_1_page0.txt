ON SAVING
U.S. LIVES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A big question in the minds
of Americans is how this war
in Korea can be ended or at
least how our government
can end this ghastly sacrifice
of American lives.
An answer to this question
is herewith presented by my
son, Raymond Moley Jr., who
as a Naval Reserve officer has
just completed his two years'
service in and around Korea.
He learned the capacities of
the South Koreans from the
best possible experience. He
accompanied the ROK Capitol
Division on its advance along
the east coast in 1950 to Chong-
jin and after the fatal moment
when the Chinese entered the
war. His last assignment was
eight months on the staff of
Adm. Joy in the negotiations
at Panmunjom. He writes:
"Should hostilities in Korea
go on indefinitely? Are we to
continue to commit great num-
bers of combat troops and the
even greater number of men
required to support them?
Are we prepared to keep the
great 8th Army committed for
years to come?

"The Communists are capable
of perpetuating the strug-
gle indefinitely against the
United Nations and Republic
of Korea forces now opposing
them. And, should an armis-
tice be achieved, sizable
forces of well-trained and well-
equipped fighting men must
be ready in South Korea in
case the Communists should
decide to renew hostilities.
"One aspect of the admin-
istration's Far Eastern policy
in the past has been the failure
to provide adequate military
aid and training to those
opposing Communism. This
was true of China and Korea
after World War II. For this
tragic folly we have paid and
are now paying dearly. If we
had given the ROKs adequate
training and equipment we
would never have suffered
117,000 casualties.
"Recently leaders of the Re-
public of Korea have pointed
out that there is a reservoir
of 700,000 men of military age
in South Korea. They have
stated that the Republic of Ko-
rea is willing and anxious to
see a large number of these
men trained and equipped.
They have pointed out that if
such a program of training
were carried out and equip-
ment were provided, ROK
troops could replace U.N.
forces along the line.

"In the past few months
some ROK units have been
given intensive training and
more equipment than they had
in the early days of the war.
According to reports of U.S.
military men in Korea, they
have performed superbly. But
these units are not new units.
They have been on the line or
in reserve for a long time.
Training of new troops has
been confined largely to re-
placements.
"If we are ultimately to re-
move the 8th Army from the
Korean Peninsula and be as-
sured of a friendly govern-
ment there, it would seem that
a program such as the Repub-
lic of Korea proposes must be
followed.
"At some time the Korean
Republic must guard its own
borders. It is time we provid-
ed the necessary training and
equipment to this large and
capable body of fighting men.
American blood cannot indef-
initely be shed on the con-
tinent of Asia."
