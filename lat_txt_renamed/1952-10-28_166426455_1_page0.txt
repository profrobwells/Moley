CLEVELAND—A calm ex-
amination of the facts should
not only reassure people who
are disturbed about the McCar-
ran Act but show how utter-
ly out of whole cloth are
Truman's screams about that
legislation.
Here in Cleveland I have
consulted a man who is prob-
ably as well informed on mat-
ters relating to immigration
and naturalization as anyone
in the United States. He is
George Green, who has been
director of the Cleveland Cit-
izens' Bureau for more than
30 years. This privately sup-
ported bureau has sympa-
thetically helped hundreds of
thousands of immigrants since
it was created during World
War I.

Green points out something
that seems to be completely
unmentioned in this brawl
over the McCarran Act. Tru-
man knows it, of course, but
he hasn't the manhood and
decency to tell the country
about it. And apparently Ei-
senhower's advisers have not
informed their man.
The McCarran Act itself
provides for its revision. This
act, which is entitled the Im-
migration and Nationality Act,
Public Law 414, has a provi-
sion, Section 401-A, which rec-
ognizes the imperfections of
the act and provides for its
amendment. It sets up a
joint Congressional committee
which is to be appointed by
Truman's two trusty col-
leagues, Vice-President Bark-
ley and House Speaker Sam
Rayburn.
It states that it is the func-
tion of the committee to make
a continuing study of "(1) the
administration of this act and
its effect on the national se-
curity, the economy and the
social welfare of the United
States, and (2) such conditions
within or without the United
States which, in the opinion
of the committee, might have
any bearing on the immigra-
tion and nationality policy of
the United States." From time
to time the committee is to
make reports to the Senate
and the House concerning
its findings.

The act simply leaves undis-
turbed the quota system that
was adopted in 1923. That sys-
tem was deliberately adopted
to limit immigration. Since its
adoption 14 Congressional elec-
tions have been held. Nine
of these resulted in Demo-
cratic Congresses, four in Re-
publican Congresses and one
was mixed.
Why has the Truman-Ste-
venson party failed to change
the quota system if it is as in-
iquitous as Truman now says
it is? Because a majority of
Democrats as well as Repub-
licans want to keep it.
Furthermore, the McCarran
Act, which does not take ef-
fect until December, must be
administered by regulations
prescribed by Truman and his
own appointees, the Secretary
of State, the Attorney General
and the Secretary of Labor.
These regulations can spell the
difference between a harsh or
a humane application of the
act. Why does not Truman
see that these regulations are
properly made?
Also, there is the joint Con-
gressional committee to sug-
gest amendments to the next
Congress, even to the extent of
rewriting the law.
★
But Truman is determined
to make a political football of
this act, just as he did with
Taft-Hartley, which also rep-
resented the overwhelming
sentiment of Congress. There-
fore, he chooses to ignore the
will of Congress. And so, on
Sept. 4 of this year, he appoint-
ed a Presidential commission
to do exactly what the Con-
gressional committee does.
And the commission is going
from city to city, stirring up
things.
The President's capacity for
intellectual double-dealing is
certainly exceeding all rec-
ords.
