When a campaign rises to
the emotional pitch that this
one has attained, I well realize
that an argument based on the
danger of Socialism in the
United States will not affect
mass voting. Certainly when
our forces are in a bloody war
in Korea our emotions cannot
linger over the domestic
scene. When the voice of war
speaks, the appeal of reason is
overwhelmed.
There has been little attention
to this issue in the Eisenhower
speeches, and the only references
to Socialism by Stevenson have
been sneering references to the
fears of those who speak of the
subject. The Governor and his
current comrade-at-arms, the
President, want us to leave the
preservation of our institutions
to them and, above all, to stop
worrying about anything except
the events of 20 years ago.
There are sincere people who
will not feel wholly quieted by
such reassurances. There is a
deep and growing feeling that
our trend toward more and more
government and less and less
private initiative and opportunity
is a malign danger. And that
feeling is not, as Stevenson and
the President tell us, confined to
a few jittery businessmen. It is
widespread among the rank and
file of our people.
Those who share that feeling
must decide at this election
which candidate offers the
greater assurance of protection
against the danger. Their
decision should be made on the
basis of what specific policies
are promoted or not by the
Truman regime.
Inflation control is one of those
policies, perhaps the major one.
For inflation destroys the value
of savings and income. Personal
savings are the very bedrock of
individual liberty. When they are
no longer of value, we have
nowhere to look but to government
doles.
Any economist worth his salt
knows that one of the indispensable
means effectively to control
inflation is through the Federal
Reserve Board. When that board
is permitted to act without
interference by the President and
the Secretary of the Treasury, it
can control credit and measurably
determine the volume and value
of money. The Federal Reserve
Board has not been permitted by
President Truman to function as
an independent agency. The
reason is that the President and
his advisers do not want inflation
to be effectively controlled. They
have deliberately stimulated
inflation while they have talked
against it.
Moreover, every person with a
comprehension of the infinitely
complex movement of prices
knows that price control is at
best a palliative and is generally
ineffectual. But Stevenson has
accepted the entire Truman policy
toward inflation.
Another cause of inflation is
overspending by the government.
Since three-quarters of Federal
spending goes for arms, a new
President must succeed in getting
more defense for less money. The
President who can do that must
deeply believe that our overall
strength and security depend
upon holding spending under the
limits of the capacity of our
domestic economy to bear it.
Eisenhower in all he has said has
not only made that clear, but his
personal experience in the United
States and in Europe has given
him the knowledge necessary to
that end.
On this issue of inflation alone,
the balance lies with Eisenhower.
There are many other policies
that are driving us toward
Socialism. I have space to mention
only two. One is the rapid,
systematic destruction of the
power of the States by the Federal
government. The other is the
substitution of a Federal machine
for our two-party system.
Against these dangers, too, the
best assurance would be the
election of Eisenhower. His
opponent has given no indication
that he understands the threats
to our constitutional system.
