IT'S A LANDSLIDE
OF ADVISERS NOW
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

And now there descends
upon President-elect Eisen-
hower a swarm of advisers,
dense enough to black out the
sun of reason.
A great majority of this
multitude are sincere people
with the true interests of Ei-
senhower and of the United
States in their minds. And a
majority are loyal people who
fought not only through the
campaign that began when the
General was nominated but in
the long war against incompe-
tence, waste and Socialism in
the years before. But other
would-be policy and appoint-
ment-makers should be
watched and properly dis-
counted.

★

The first group, already par-
tially in the saddle, are the
IBC (Ike Before Chicago).
They correspond to the famous
RBC (Roosevelt Before Chi-
cago). In 1933 and thereafter
those people were preferred in
all appointments. The Al Smith
and other dissident Democrats
were placed at the foot of the
class. Some left the party and
became hostile critics.
Roosevelt proved that he
could win without the conser-
vative Democrats, but that
policy resulted in the transfor-
mation of the Democratic
Party into the combination of
alliances in which it now finds
itself.
In the present instance
Eisenhower is not likely to
exhibit such vindictiveness, be-
cause the Taft States joined
in the victory parade with
majorities comparable to those
in the East and New England.

★

There are those among the
IBC, however, who might be
called the ABT's (Anybody
But Taft). Wayne Morse is
this type in its most indignant
form. These will insist upon a
Cabinet headed, perhaps, by
Paul Hoffman, who proved his
membership in ABT by say-
ing, after Eisenhower's nomi-
nation in Chicago, that they
didn't need the Taft people to
win.
Then there is a curious
breed, the DFIBCO (Demo-
crats For Ike Before Chicago
Only). Plenty of these are in
my own profession of journal-
ism. They were writing and
talking industriously for
Eisenhower before Chicago as
the man the Republicans must
nominate. Then, after their
wish had been granted, they
grew cool.

★

When Eisenhower and Taft
made their rapprochement,
they ran screaming into the
Stevenson camp. They merely
wanted Eisenhower as insur-
ance against the possibility of
a Republican victory. Notably
represented by some of our
eminent commentators, they
are now saying that the Re-
publican Party really did not
win this election. They, too,
have their suggestions for
Cabinet material, all of whom
are people who, like Hoffman
and Clay, served under Tru-
man.
Finally there are the AIUS
(Anybody Including Us).
These people were never au-
thentic party men. They gained
admittance to the New Deal
because they were radicals.
Some of them even penetrated
the Hoover administration.
Members of this group are in
Federal jobs and will by flat-
tery and beguilement seek to
hold on. Some will covertly
promote candidacies which
will later be advantageous to
them. And I have no doubt
that a goodly number of them
will be drawing Federal pay
two years hence.

Eisenhower made some flat
declarations of belief in par-
ty government. Now he should
redeem those declarations. His
best friends in that course will
be the people who fought over
the years against the evils
which he himself denounced
in his campaign. Those peo-
ple suffered defeat over and
over, but they never quit.
They fought for the preserva-
tion of American liberty and
opportunity. Their contribu-
tion to the education of the
public prepared the way for
Eisenhower. For this victory
was not won in three months.
It was the result of nearly two
decades of effort.
These latter are the people
upon whom Eisenhower can
depend in years ahead. But
he must not desert them now
for the summer soldiers of
1952.
