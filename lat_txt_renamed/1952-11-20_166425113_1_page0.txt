WHAT! NO
RABBITS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Many of those who are old
enough to remember 1933 will
expect the new Eisenhower
administration to repeat the
amazing performance of the
first months of the Roosevelt
administration. In the course
of the famous hundred days,
which was the duration of the
special session of Congress of
that year, a record of impor-
tant legislative enactments
was made that will probably
never be equaled.

I can offer some testimony
of what happened, for it was
my function to prepare with
the President the messages
that went to Congress with
each proposal.

A decision would be reached
after a White House confer-
ence of interested people, in-
cluding Senators and Repre-
sentatives, Cabinet members
and others, to launch a specific
measure. Various people were
set to work drafting the bill,
and when it was ready we
would prepare a message and
the bill would be introduced.

The measures were not
mere improvisations. They
were, with one or two excep-
tions, the result of months of
study. Some had been pre-
sented in campaign speeches
in 1932.

It should be noted further
that many New Deal measures
had been matters of Congres-
sional discussion. Some, in
fact, grew out of the thinking
of members of the Hoover ad-
ministration. What had hap-
pened was that many essential
reforms had been overdue for
some years. Conflicts between
Presidents and Congress had
prevented action. Roosevelt's
election with a big Democratic
majority in Congress broke the
log jam. Hence, the rapidity of
action.

Moreover, it was an admin-
istration with a mandate to ex-
tend Federal power and to ex-
pand the control of govern-
ment over many aspects of eco-
nomic life. Also, it had a man-
date to do something drastic
about the depression.

With a new conservative ad-
ministration, the need for ac-
tion is quite different. The
major trouble with this coun-
try is that Washington has
been doing too many things.
What is needed is a period for
digestion. The very nature of
a conservative is to take what
exists and to make the very
best of it.

The big question with any
administration or any majority
in Congress is not how fast it
is going but where it is going.
Not the length of the step but
the direction!

Let us take as an example
Social Security. No right-
thinking person wants to abol-
ish that measure of govern-
ment intervention in personal
liberty. Moreover, the system
has in trust vast amounts that
belong to the people who have
contributed their taxes for the
assurance of repayment later.
But the way in which this sys-
tem is operated is a vital ques-
tion. And the new administra-
tion can properly overhaul
that system so that it can work
more equitably and more ef-
ficiently.

Finally, there is need to kill
once and for all the fallacy of
which defenders of Roosevelt
and Truman have been guilty
for years. They sneer at their
critics, saying: "You would not
repeal what we have done, but
you say that you would do it
better. But since we adopted
these programs we can admin-
ister them better."

The answer to that is that,
while these programs can be
kept, it is of vital importance
to get them done better. For
how you do a thing may well
be the answer to the question
whether you should do it at
all. How may be as important
as what.

Hence, the Eisenhower ad-
ministration may well concern
itself for a while with the how
rather than the what. It may
not thrill the public with new
experiments, but it may show
how we can have government
at less cost in money and in
individual liberty.
