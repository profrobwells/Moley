Newsmen Are Better
Prophets Than Pollsters
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a column a few days ago
I paid my respects to the na-
tional pollsters. I agreed with
my fellow commentator, David
Lawrence, that they should
confine themselves to a mere
presentation of the facts they
gather and leave the interpre-
tation of those facts to others.
I agreed also with the con-
tention of Lawrence that his
poll of editors across the coun-
try turned out to be an excel-
lent way of forecasting the re-
sult. I might illustrate the
value of experienced opinion
of people in local communi-
ties by telling how I com-
piled, for my own information
only, a consensus of informed
judgments in the three suc-
cessive days before election.
I avoided any prediction in
anything I wrote for publica-
tion.
At the beginning of my cal-
culations, two or three weeks
before election, I listed the fol-
lowing States as sure for or
leaning toward Eisenhower:
Colorado, Delaware, Idaho,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine,
Michigan, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, North Dakota, Ore-
gon, South Dakota, Vermont
and Wisconsin. That equals
108 electoral votes.
Then I listed these States as
sure for or leaning to Steven-
son: Alabama, Arkansas, Geor-
gia, Kentucky, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, Ok-
lahoma, Rhode Island, South
Carolina and West Virginia.
That equals 104 electoral votes.
How I arrived at those
guesses is hard to tell. My
judgments were in part based
on the presumed solidity of
those States on one side or the
other. In part they were
based on what I had heard or
seen in my coast-to-coast trav-
els this summer; and in part
on what the press reported or
what I learned from my cor-
respondence.

Then on Saturday, Nov. 1,
after many telephone calls and
a trip to the Midwest and an-
other to Connecticut, I added
to my Eisenhower list: Con-
necticut, Illinois, Maryland,
Minnesota, Nevada, New Jer-
sey, New Mexico, Ohio, Penn-
sylvania, Utah, Virginia and
Wyoming. The electoral votes
of those States equal 154. Added
to the earlier Eisenhower
list, the total was 262.
I changed those States from
doubtful to Eisenhower large-
ly for these reasons:
Connecticut, after two trips
there attending two small
meetings, and conversations
with a number of politicians
and newspaper people.
Illinois, after talking with
Charles Rogers of the Chicago
Daily News and Milburn Ak-
ers of the Chicago Sun-Times.
The latter sent me reports on
many down-State counties
from an experienced reporter.
Maryland, because of the
published reports of editors.
Minnesota, because of the
Minneapolis Tribune poll and
the opinion of Gideon Say-
mour of that paper.
Nevada, because I could feel
sure that the McCarran in-
fluence would not go to a
Truman candidate.
New Jersey, because of the
opinions of editors there.
New Mexico, frankly be-
cause in the curious politics of
that State it was to be expect-
ed that Chavez and Eisenhow-
er would win.
Ohio, because of the opin-
ions and polls of the newspa-
pers in Toledo, Cleveland, and
Columbus.
★
Pennsylvania, because there
was no reported reason to ex-
pect the Republican trend of
the past few years to be re-
versed.
Utah, because an experi-
enced politician told me so.
Virginia, because Dewey
came so close in 1948 without
Byrd’s public renunciation of
the Democratic candidate.
Wyoming, because of re-
ports from editors there.
I then assigned Arizona,
Louisiana, Montana and Wash-
ington to Stevenson, largely
because of personal reports
from politicians in each State.
That gave Stevenson a total of
131.
That left as doubtful: Cali-
fornia, Florida, Massachusetts,
New York, Tennessee, Texas
—a total of 138.
My best contact in Califor-
nia, Kyle Palmer of the Los
Angeles Times, a notoriously
conservative judge, said that
Eisenhower would carry the
State.
James Stahlman of Nash-
ville told me that Ike would
carry Tennessee and Florida.
The New York Daily News
poll, carefully analyzed, gave
the State to Ike.
Allen Duckworth of the Dal-
las Daily News told me he be-
lieved Texas would go to Ei-
senhower.
Those opinions on the
doubtful States indicated a
score of 384 for Eisenhower,
131 for Stevenson, with the 16
Massachusetts votes still
doubtful. The actual total was
442-89.
That result proves once
more that the best judges are
the newspapermen in the vari-
ous States. They supply the
common sense of which
“scientific” polls are in need.
