Eisenhower Will Give His
Assistant More Weight
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The recent campaign dealt
almost exclusively with the
President as a policymaker.
Little is said of the President
as Chief Executive and admin-
istrator. And yet, under the
Constitution, the latter is his
major function.
But administrative matters
make dull reading or listening.
It is much more thrilling to
hear about new laws the Presi-
dential candidate will recom-
mend or how he will clean up
the mess.
But one of the essentials in
cleaning up the "mess" will be
to organize the Presidential
office so that the Chief Execu-
tive can control his own
administration. Eisenhower's
first step in that direction has
been to name Gov. Sherman
Adams as "the assistant to the
President," an office now held
by John R. Steelman.
New significance will be giv-
en to this job in the Eisenhow-
er administration. Eisenhower
clearly signified this in nam-
ing Adams along with his Cabi-
net. Under Adams, who is in
his own right a Governor and
served as general manager for
Eisenhower in the campaign,
the post will have an impor-
tance far beyond that which it
has had in the past.
This matter of assistance or
assistants for the President
has been one of concern for 20
years. Hoover had three "sec-
retaries," all of equal rank, and
an "administrative assistant."
When F. D. R. moved in, Louis
Howe, his man Friday, became
his sole secretary. Marvin Mc-
Intyre and Stephen Early be-
came "assistant secretaries."
Hoover's "administrative as-
sistant" job was abolished.
Howe, already racked by a
fatal illness, was determined
that no one should rival him
in his role as the President's
chief adviser. Things went
on hit or miss for seven years,
until in F. D. R.'s second term
six "administrative assistants"
were set up. In a report on
administration at that time, it
was suggested that these peo-
ple should have a "passion for
anonymity." Hugh Johnson
quite properly wrote in a col-
umn that a person with power
could never be anonymous.
These people would, he said,
leave their tracks like "a herd
of elephants in six feet of
snow," if they were doing a
real job. If not, there was no
need for them at all.
But Roosevelt was never
content to work with official
"chains of command." He
tossed authority about, here
and there, to officials and el-
vilians, cronies or phonies like
a sultan on a spree. One day
it was Hopkins, or Walker, or
Richberg. Meanwhile, the Di-
rector of the Budget, who by
tradition was actually a Presl-
dential helper, was grabbed by
Morgenthau and reduced to
the status of a Treasury un-
derling. Even Truman with
his cronies has had a better
sense of organization.
Now, with Eisenhower who
knows how to organize and
Adams who knows how to con-
ciliate, things will improve.
But it is desirable still that
the Budget Director be re-
habilitated and restored to the
importance he had in 1921-22
when Charles Dawes really
made a big job of it. The
Budget Director should be re-
sponsible only to the President
and he should rank with the
members of the Cabinet. He
should not be under a Pres-
idential assistant.
