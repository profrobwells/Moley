There Must Be No Delay
in Cutting Our Expenses
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The air these days is full of
plans and proposals under the
new administration for cutting
expenditures and lightening
the burden of taxes. Some of
them come from Eisenhower
headquarters; others from
members of Congress. Perhaps
this many-sided attack is best,
for there are many sides to
the problem.
But one thing is certain. If
any progress is to be made
toward a reduction in the size
and cost of our Federal levia-
than, it should be made just as
soon as possible after Jan. 20.
And by "just as soon as possi-
ble" I mean within four and
perhaps two weeks. There
will be no time for long, aca-
demic studies, for studies by
task forces, efficiency experts
and accountants. Rugged work
with a broadax is necessary
and quickly.
The Hoover reports, now
gathering dust after nearly
four years, provide sufficient
information to save two or
three billions in civil expendi-
tures alone. Sen. Byrd could tell
Eisenhower or his Director of
the Budget enough in a day
to provide for still more sav-
ings.

I do not question the sincer-
ity of Dr. Robert Johnson who
proposes that his Temple Uni-
versity survey can provide a
basis for simplifying the struc-
ture of our government. But
such a job, undertaken under
at least semiacademic aus-
pices, will take time, and for
major cuts there is no time
to take.
The Hoover Commission, it
should be remembered, was
bipartisan. It had on it rep-
resentatives of Congress and
of the Truman administration.
Its sole concern was with the
methods used to carry out
established functions of gov-
ernment. It could not under
its terms of reference question
the desirability of the activi-
ties themselves. That was its
tragic weakness—a weakness
clearly recognized by Mr.
Hoover himself.
Now the new Congress and
Eisenhower can go far beyond
method and challenge the de-
sirability of many functions
now provided by law. They
can go beyond reorganization
and get to the job of deorgan-
ization. Mr. Hoover could tell
them about many things that
could now be eliminated—ac-
tion that he could not get his
commission to recommend.
That commission included at
last three Fair Dealers,
headed by none other than
Dean Acheson himself. When-
ever a real question of slash-
ing activities arose these mi-
nority members rushed into
print with minority reports.
There is good precedent for
very quick action. When
Roosevelt took office in March,
1933, he had not as yet em-
braced the spending philoso-
phy of Keynes, Hopkins, et al.
★
Within the first week, on
March 10, he sent a message
to Congress demanding author-
ity "to effect drastic economies
in government." Note that he
asked for authority to make
the cuts and submitted legisla-
tion to do so. Congress acted at
once, and the "Act to Maintain
the Credit of the United
States" was approved by the
President nine days later.
This, it may be said, was a
"nine-day wonder."
But in reply it can be said
that it was nevertheless a
wonder. It saved money and
gave the country a tremendous
burst of confidence.
That plan for economy and
the bill itself, I believe, were
the work of Lewis Douglas,
Director of the Budget and a
rugged advocate of economy.
I may add that I wrote the
message, which included a
notable line: "Too often in re-
cent history liberal govern-
ments have been wrecked on
rocks of loose fiscal policy—
it is too late for a leisurely ap-
proach to this problem."
Gen. Eisenhower, Sen. Taft,
Congressman Taber, and the
President-elect's new commit-
tee consisting of Messrs. Rocke-
feller, Flemming and Brother
Milton might well note that
example of quick, drastic ac-
tion.
