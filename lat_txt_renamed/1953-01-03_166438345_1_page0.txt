Edmund Burke once
warned the House of Com-
mons that statecraft was not
a mere problem of arithmetic.
Basic in the philosophy of
that great friend of liberty
was the proposition that
something more than a ma-
jority vote is required to con-
stitute consent of the gov-
erned. That proposition was
also a basic element in the
philosophy of those who
made our Constitution. That
is proved by all of the de-
vices, now well tested by
time and embodied in the
Constitution, which guard
against precipitate action by
a bare majority.
This proposition comes to
the surface again in the ef-
fort spearheaded by Sens.
Lehman and Ives of New
York to limit Senate debate.
I can realize that it sounds
like a denial of popular gov-
ernment to advocate the re-
tention of the present rule
which makes it very difficult
to get a vote even when a
clear majority wants a vote.
But there are elements in the
present situation as well as
in the basic principles of
orderly government that com-
mend the rule now in effect.
★
That rule is numbered 22
and it provides that to close
debate a petition signed by
16 Senators must be present-
ed and voted upon the day
after it appears. Then by a
vote of 64 Senators, which is
two-thirds of the full mem-
bership, debate on a pending
measure can be limited to
one hour for each member.
This means of limiting debate
was devised and enacted in
1917 just prior to the decla-
ration of war against Ger-
many.
However, the privilege or
power to debate without lim-
it can still be enjoyed on any
proposal to change Rule 22
and that means unlimited
delay if, as is proposed, the
advocates of compulsory civil
rights legislation insist upon
elimination of Rule 22.
The proposal to avoid un-
limited debate on a proposal
to limit debate is to declare
that the Senate which will
assemble on Jan. 20 is a new
Senate. If so, it must adopt
a new set of rules. The argu-
ment against any such as-
sumption cannot be dis-
missed in this space nor can
the merits or demerits of
compulsory civil rights legis-
lation.
There is space only for a
mention of two items of
considerable importance. The
first is the practical question
whether Senate debate under
this rule, now 35 years old,
has really barred the way to
the writing into legislation of
the ascertained will of the
people of the United States.
On that point the evidence
is all on the side of a negative
answer. In these 35 years
immense reforms and read-
justments have been enacted
by Congressional legislation.
★
Further change is possible.
The sole purpose of this pres-
ent move is to open the way
to legislation to which a great
section of the nation, amount-
ing perhaps to over a quarter
of the States, is bitterly op-
posed. What Sen. Ives and
Lehman want to do is to com-
pel all of the States to accept
a type of legislation which
they have adopted in their
own State of New York. To
accomplish this they would
remove a protection against
hasty action by the Senate
which has stood for genera-
tions.
The other item has to do
with the principle of the con-
sent of the governed. Consent
in that sense is not valid or
practical when it is attained
by a mere majority, with a
very large minority wholly
out of sympathy with the ac-
tion taken.
Consent is valid and last-
ing only when those involved
freely, knowingly, willingly,
and with a part in creating
the situation, enter into the
benefits and responsibilities
of the decision. For that rea-
son no Federal civil rights
program attained only by a
majority of the Senate can
be effective or lasting.
