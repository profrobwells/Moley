A CABINET FOR THINKING PURPOSES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last week on a television
show in answer to a question
about the President's Cabinet,
I said, rather offhand, that
if the President wished he
could have George Marshall,
not the General but the owner
of the Washington Redskins,
sit with the Cabinet.
What I should have said
was that if the President
thought enough of George's
advice he might find a small
sinecure for him and then
have him sit with the Cabinet.
For there is nothing in the
Constitution that specifies
membership in the Cabinet
and if the President wanted
to change the custom he could
have a Cabinet composed of
the director of the National
Museum, the governor of the
U.S. Soldiers' Home, the direc-
tor of the National Zoological
Park and the Chief Commis-
sioner of Indian Claims.

All that the Constitution
says is that the President
"may require the opinion, in
writing, of the principal of-
ficer in each of the executive
departments, upon any sub-
ject relating to the duties of
their respective offices." A
lawyer with a strict sense of
constitutional limitations
might argue that the specifi-
cation "in writing" was in-
tended to foreclose the spo-
ken words in a Cabinet meet-
ing. Also he might contend
that the specific words limit-
ing the said advice to matters
relating to the officer's de-
partment were meant to rule
out his advice on all other
matters of government.
The British, from whom we
acquired the word cabinet as
well as the custom of more
or less formal meetings there-
of, recognize the institution
only by custom. The Prime
Minister is also a creature of
custom, not law.
But the British have made
a much more serviceable
body of advisers by keeping
the membership flexible.
They also have improved up-
on us by providing a number
of Cabinet Ministers with lit-
tle or no administrative du-
ties, thus freeing good minds
from details in order that
they may devote themselves
fruitfully to broad policy.
In the beginning George
Washington seemed to feel
that the very small Senate
of his day was the ap-
propriate place to seek ad-
vice and counsel. Indeed the
Constitution reserves the
word advice to the President's
relations with the Senate.
And Washington started to
meet in person with the Sen-
ate but it is said that Sena-
tors on one occasion so ruf-
fled the father of our coun-
try that he left in a rage,
vowing with some choice
Washingtonian cuss words
that he never would meet
with them again. And he did
not.
Gradually, the custom arose
of regular meetings with the
chief department heads. For
many, many years that was
a practical thing to do. But in
recent years a department
head is charged with such
colossal administrative re-
sponsibilities that he has
small time to think about the
broad subjects with which
Cabinet meetings should be
concerned.

Eisenhower might well ex-
pand the customary Cabinet
by adding many others such
as the heads and chief com-
missioners of the big inde-
pendent agencies. He might
also add such Presidential
assistants, such as Sherman
Adams, who are of some stat-
ure.
Then as a means of ex-
pediting business he might
select a few, say about six,
to serve as a committee on
general policy, free them so
far as possible of administra-
tive work and gradually de-
velop a Cabinet for thinking
rather than administration.
For the present system
promotes neither good think-
ing nor efficient administra-
tion.
