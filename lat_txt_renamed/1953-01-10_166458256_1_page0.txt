Churchill Doesn't Quite
Get Our View on Korea
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is a mistake to assume,
as Mr. Churchill seems to,
that our real unhappiness
with Britain has to do with
money. It has to do with
what we should do about the
war in Korea.
While we may gripe some-
what about American money,
we are deeply moved about
American lives. And as any
good observer of the psy-
chology of the late campaign
might have told Churchill,
we have just seen the Amer-
ican people brush aside pros-
perity as an issue and make
their decision on the human
issue of war.
Perhaps the wretched job
of some British papers in
reporting the campaign may
have misled the Prime Min-
ister, although he has always
seemed to be keenly aware
of American feelings.
Already, there are sharp
reactions in this country to
Churchill's comments about
the war in Asia. Americans
are saying, correctly, that no
one over here advocates "an
indefinite extension of the
war." Nor do they need to
hear from the Prime Minister
what was said over and over
by Stevenson and Acheson
about the "real center of
gravity" being in Europe.
These were comments that
might well have been left
unsaid.

But if we are a bit irri-
tated at those comments, we
should not rush to the con-
clusion that we can or
should solve the Korean
problem without the co-opera-
tion of Britain. For we shall
need the "solid front" that
Churchill quite properly
stresses.
The necessity for a new
statement of our relations
with Churchill's government
is the key to the policies of
Dulles and, we may assume,
those of Eisenhower. A most
important factor in this is
the need that a means be
found to stop the deadly flow
of goods, to the Chinese. Brit-
ain must not only strengthen
her policy of allowing no
shipments from her own
shores, but take vigorous
action to check all other ship-
ments except those from
Soviet Russia through the
Manchurian ports. In short,
the best plan would be as
complete a blockade of China
as possible short of a blockade
of the Soviet ports. Such a
blockade could be very ef-
fective if we had the com-
plete co-operation of the Brit-
ish government.

There are those who object
to a policy of cutting trade
with Red China on the
ground that it would drive
that country into more com-
plete dependency on Russia.
That is not a valid objection,
because greater dependence
by Red China would not be
advantageous to Russia.
Quite the contrary, it might
ultimately bring Russia to a
real desire for peace in Ko-
rea. For supplying the needs
of China is no mean responsi-
bility. Nor would Russia en-
joy being thrust more deep-
ly into Chinese affairs. An
old Chinese proverb says:
"Don't move into a Chinese
house unless you like to sleep
on the stove."
The wasting of Chinese
lives is of no importance to
a Russian, but an endless ex-
penditure of Russian goods
is not a pleasant prospect to
the Kremlin.
