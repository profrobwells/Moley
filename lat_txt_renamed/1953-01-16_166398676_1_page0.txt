THE COX
REPORT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

On the day before Christmas, Congressman Eugene
Cox died.
The most recent activity of
this able and aggressive
legislator had been as chairman
of the "select committee
to investigate and study
educational and philanthropic
foundations." The report
of the committee was partly
completed when Congressman
Cox was taken with his
last illness, and he approved
at least a part of the document
submitted to the House
on Jan. 1.
This report is manifestly
tentative. The illness and
death of the chairman prevented
a more thorough
study. But even had Mr. Cox
lived, there would be need
to continue this study in a
more leisurely fashion during
the 83rd Congress.
★
It was unfortunate that
during the hearings public
reports should have stressed
the more sensational aspects
of the inquiry, which had to
do with "infiltration" of foundations
by subversive individuals
and organizations. A
much more important line of
inquiry would portray the
extent and character of foundations,
their general lines of
activity, their forms of organization,
and the advantages
and dangers inherent
in this kind of philanthropic
giving.
For these organizations
have proliferated at an amazing
rate in the 40 years since
the Rockefeller Foundation
was created in 1913. The Bureau
of Internal Revenue reports
more than 20,000 tax-
exempt organizations.
★
An exact estimate of the
number of foundations included
among them depends,
according to the Cox committee,
on the definition of
such an agency. The Cox report
says that at least 1000
have permanent endowments
of more than $50,000
and are embarked on programs
of philanthropic giving.
These, it is estimated,
have an aggregate of assets
of $2,600,000,000 and had expenditures
of $133,000,000 in
1950. This estimate of expenditures
seems to be low.
The Rockefeller Foundation
alone reported for 1951 new
appropriations of more than
$21,000,000 and unpaid appropriations
from former years
of more than $26,000,000.
More specific information
is promised this year by the
American Foundations Information
Service.
★
The extent to which the
funds of foundations were
used for subversive purposes
is, according to the Cox report,
"surprisingly small."
However, there is definitive
evidence that such uses,
while small, have been important
and unfortunate.
The committee warns those
responsible for the conduct
of foundations that greater
activity by trustees and directors
and more competent
staff work are going to
be necessary not merely to
prevent subversive influences
from getting a foothold but
generally to protect the public
interest. For all these
institutions, since they enjoy
measurable tax exemption,
have a definite public interest.
★
The other major question
faced by the Cox committee
was the extent to which
"foundations are being used
as a device for tax avoidance
and tax evasion." This point
the committee turns over to
the House Committee on
Ways and Means. What that
committee proposes to do is
not yet determined.
