HOPEFUL
MOVES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two incidents on the first
full day of Eisenhower's Pres-
idency bring to mind a major
campaign promise of the new
President.
ane promise was to turn
back the movement toward
centralising all government
pqwer in Washington.
The incidents were the ap-
pointment of Val Peterson,.
former Governor of Nebras-
ka, as a Presidential assistant
in charge of relations with
the States, and a luncheon
meeting of the President with
Govs. Kohler of Wisconsin
and Thornton of Colorado,
at which was discussed the
return of some tax sources to
the States.
★
Eisenhower's promise to
the States, made in a speech
In Des Moines, was this:
"We will see that the legit-
imate rights of the States and
local communities are re-
spected. We will not only
stop the taking over the tax
sources of the States, but
seek reasonably to return
thein. And we will not reach
into the States and take from
them their powers and their
responsibilities to serve their
citizens. Where the Federal
government can and should
help, it will help. But it will
regard Itself in matters of
State and local responsibility
as a friend and not as a mas-
ter."
The return of some tax
sources to the States and
local communities is by all
odds the best way to preserve
our Federal-State system. It
also could materially reduce
the total cost of government.
For a tax levied by a unit of
government that is near the
taxpayer can more effectively
be controlled.
Moreover, the activity for
which the tax is levied will
be under sharper scrutiny at
the local level. A good exam-
ple is the question of Feder-
al ald to schools. For that,
Truman repeatedly asked an
appropriation of $300,000,000.
But if the Federal govern-
ment would return all amuse-
ment taxes to the State and
local governments, $450,000,
000 could be realized for the
improvement of schools at
those levels.
★
The Hoover Commission
task force on Federal-State
relations recommended the
creation of a joint Congres-
sional committee on Federal-
State relations for the pur-
pose of developing construc-
tive steps toward rationaliz-
ing the grants-in-ald as well
as the reapportionment of tax
sources.
Very few Governors have
been as close to this problem
as Val Peterson, and his new
assignment as a Presidential
assistant gives him full scope
to take the leadership in this
field for the President. He
will be definitely more use-
ful at this task than he would
have been as Ambassador to
India.
It was announced also that
Govs. Kohler and Thornton
discussed with the President
the conflict between Federal
and State taxes and the need
to get the Federal govern-
ment out of fields of taxa-
tion that by tradition and
logic belong to the States.
Here is an excellent spot
for President Eisenhower to
begin to redeem his campaign
promises. He ought to present
the Hoover recommendations
for action by Congress,
