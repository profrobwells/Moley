RUSSIAN
DIGESTION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The President's appoint-
ment of a board on "psycho-
logical warfare," headed by
William H. Jackson, togeth-
er with the common sense
expressed in Secretary Dul-
les' speech last week, shows
his determination to attack
Communism with some poi-
icy other than to fight bor-
der wars. Instead of the Tru-
man-Acheson policy of "con-
tainment," the choice of
Eisenhower is "penetration.
When Eisenhower as a can-
didate proposed a new ap-
proach to world Communism,
there were bitter charges by
Truman and Stevenson that
he was proposing to incite
hopeless and bloody revolu-
tions in the satellites of Rus-
sia.
Neither Eisenhower nor
Dulles was able to reply fully
to this, because to do so
would reveal their purposes
to the Soviets.
*
Dulles has laid the ground-
work for the new attack,
however, in a section of his
speech in which he speaks
of "indigestion" within the
Soviet sphere of influence.
He said:
"The Russian Communists,
as I have pointed out, have
swallowed a great many peo-
ple to date, approximately
800,000,000, but you know
there is such a thing as indi-
gestion. People don't always
get stronger by eating more;
sometimes they eat more
than they can digest and they
get weaker instead of getting
stronger.
"And already there are
signs of indigestion within
the Russian Communist
world. The purges and the
trials that are going on in
Eastern Europe, the whole-
sale executions that are go-
ing on in Communist China,
all these things show the peo-
ple are restive and are un-
happy.
"And a great deal can be
done to make these peoples,
these captive peoples, retain
such a love of freedom and
independence and to bring
such a love and determina-
tion to keep independence on
the part of these peoples that
I've talked about who are
menaced that they can't be
swallowed and digested by
Soviet Communism. And per-
haps in time the indigestion
will become so acute that it
might be fatal."
I am not positive about the
originators of the Eisen-
hower-Dulles plan for increas-
ing the agonies of this Soviet
indigestion, but I have reason
to believe that they or the
people who were working
with them in August were in-
spired by a very remarkable
book, James Burnham's "The
Coming Defeat of Commu-
nism." At any rate, a person
in the policymaking group
of the Eisenhower camps
said that at last Eisenhower
had accepted his argument to
try the Burnham approach.
â˜…
Burnham frankly calls his
plan "political-subversive war-
fare." It should be guided by
an "agency at the highest gov-
ernment level." The head of
this agency should be "re-
sponsible to the President
only." This agency should
presumably be well equipped
with funds, with no obliga-
tion to make public the ways
in which those funds would
be used.
Also this agency should use
every agency and person to
reach into the satellites, and
by every means known to sub-
version create unrest and dis-
order. This does not mean
starting open revolt. But it
does mean laying the ground-
work for revolt when the
time is ripe.
