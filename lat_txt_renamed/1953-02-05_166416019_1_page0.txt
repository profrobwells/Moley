The development of any
serious objections to Sen.
Taft's amendments to his law
is doubtful. The reason is that
neither labor nor manage-
ment can be seriously injured
by the suggested changes and
that the great third party, the
public, is not likely to be able
to object.
That is in the very nature
of modern politics, in which
parties and politicians seek
the support of this or that
minority and assume that the
public cannot formulate or
express its wishes.
Nearly six years have
passed, and labor and man-
agement have adjusted them-
selves to the Taft-Hartley
order of things. All the in-
ertia of the status quo will
operate against radical
change. Labor leaders have
shouted "slave labor" in three
campaigns, the law has stood
up, and nobody is in chains.
Hence, that slogan is beyond
usefulness. Management
would go several steps further,
but is doing quite well
with things as they stand.

The core of the Taft-Hart-
ley Act is the prohibition
against the expulsion from
unions of members for any
reasons except nonpayment
of dues and assessments. This
protects members against the
power of union bosses who
used to be able to expel mem-
bers who acted contrary to
their orders in union elec-
tions and also, in some cases,
in political campaigns. In
union shops this protection
also extends to the worker's
job itself. This aspect of T-H
is not touched by the Taft
amendments.
The injunction provision
would also be kept. This is
the famous provision which
allows the government to secure
an order from a court
to delay a strike and thus provide
more time for bargain-
ing.
★
The amendments proposed
by Taft would make little difference
in the operation of
the act. One would compel
employers as well as union
officers to take a non-Communist
oath. This is to equalize
the status of management
and labor. It would be mere
routine.
Another would remove
some of the limitations now
in T-H secondary boycotts.
This is a concession to labor.
Other amendments are
purely administrative and
deal with the National Labor
Relations Board. There are
still others that are equally
unimportant.
It is the outspoken opinion
of many critics of the Wagner
Act that both the original
Taft-Hartley Act and the
present amendments ignore
the two major dangers in labor
relations. The first of
these is the restriction on the
right of workers generally by
legalizing the union shop.
The second is failure to outlaw
industry-wide bargain-
ing.
★
In both cases the preferences
of all labor leaders and
many employers are identical.
When a union shop is already
in effect, the employer
acquiesces in a limitation of
his liberty in return for stable
relations with the union
and a certain measure of discipline
by the union leaders
over his employees.
Industry-wide bargaining
is accepted by many employers
because they are protected
against a competitive
squeeze if all their competitors
are treated alike by a
nationwide union.
But when management and
union leaders both profit by
a monopoly, the public and
nonunion workers suffer.
Neither the Senator nor the
President seems to want to
alleviate that danger.
