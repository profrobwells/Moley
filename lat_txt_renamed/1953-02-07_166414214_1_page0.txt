Eisenhower's Message
Shows the Conservative
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The President's message to
Congress is the first complete
showing that we have had of
the political philosophy of a
sincerely conservative man.
The true mark of a person
who is by emotions and in-
stinct conservative is that on
matters in which he feels
sure of himself he will take
calculated risks, but will
tread with caution in dealing
with subjects where his
knowledge is sketchy.
Thus, the President's atti-
tude toward the the war in
Asia, diplomatic commitments
and blunders reflects the fu-
sion of the specialized knowl-
edge of Dulles, a splendidly
trained expert in foreign
policy, and Eisenhower, a
military master. The nation
will just have to trust these
two men.
On domestic affairs, where
the President must depend
upon the combined wisdom of
many people and pick his
course by instinct rather than
by knowledge, the message is
exceedingly reassuring. The
remarkable thing is that, de-
spite his scanty information,
Eisenhower has done so well.
It must be remembered that
when Eisenhower was nomi-
nated he was probably as
poorly prepared in the art
and science of civil govern-
ment as any President since
Grant. When in August I first
saw at firsthand the so-called
brain trust that surrounded
him and that had been large-
ly bestowed upon him by Gov.
Dewey, I felt a deep appre-
hension lest we have a repeti-
tion of the campaigns of 1944
and 1948. I felt somewhat re-
assured when I talked with
the candidate and found him
sound in his instincts and dis-
posed to break through the
me-tooers around him and get
help from other sources.
His speeches in the cam-
paign, with a few exceptions,
were on foreign or military
affairs. And campaign speech-
es in any event are inade-
quate portrayals of a man's
real philosophy.
In this message, however,
we get the results of some
real homework. The Presi-
dent seems to have done an
exceedingly good job at pick-
ing the brains of his new
Cabinet and of others whom
he has consulted since the
election. Good illustrations
of this are his discussions of
conservation and reclama-
tion of natural resources and
of social welfare.
He quite properly calls for
the continued development of
natural resources but calls
for co-operative efforts by
Federal, State, and private
agencies. This is almost the
first time in 20 years that
this problem has been por-
trayed by a President as any-
thing but a Federal responsi-
bility.
He takes notes of the intra-
governmental competition be-
tween the Army Corps of
Engineers and the Interior
Department without men-
tioning those agencies by
name.
He suggests that reorgani-
zation plans must be prepared
and that most of these re-
sources problems pertain to
the Department of the Interi-
or. This follows the Hoover
report, but will not be good
news to some of the Presi-
dent's old Army friends.
In speaking of social wel-
fare, the President put his
finger on the real issue. This
is the proper distribution of
responsibility between the
Federal, the State, and local
units of government. This
means not only a considera-
tion of how to keep relief and
welfare activities close to the
people and to avoid bureau-
cratic domination by Wash-
ington, but a possible return
of some tax sources to State
and local government.
If that were accomplished,
the march toward a welfare
state might be stopped. In
fact, the trend might be re-
versed. To deal with this,
the President suggests a thor-
ough study by a commission
appointed for the purpose.
This message portrays the
living faith of a sound Amer-
ican, with respect for the
values of the past and the
realities of the present.
