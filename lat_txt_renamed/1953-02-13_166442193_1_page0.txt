OBJECTION
TO CONANT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations by unanimous
vote and the Senate by
voice vote have approved
Harvard's former president,
James B. Conant, for the post
of High Commissioner for
Germany. These public and
official decisions were heavily
qualified by private and unofficial
doubts. Most of those
doubts pertained to the wisdom
of sending to Germany a
man who had expressed
views about the treatment of
Germany which are now regarded
as wrong in conception and
disastrous in application.

★

But despite doubts, Democrats
approved because the
theories expressed in 1911
were similar to those of the
Roosevelt administration, and
Republicans nodded because
they do not want to mar the
honeymoon. In any event,
the appointment is complete,
and we shall have to hope for
the best.

Not so, however, with the
Conant philosophy of education
and of the relations of a
university to public authority.
For Conant's views on
these subjects have had immense
influence, and he will
leave behind in the world of
education many fledgling Conants
who are and will be capable
of making grave decisions.

Conant's views are fairly
well incorporated in his annual
report to the Harvard
board of overseers for the
academic year now closed.
This is, however, more than
one year's survey. It is, he
says, his "20th and last
report," and it essays a review
of changes since 1932.

A reading of this report
raised a number of doubts in
my mind, only one of which
my space permits me to develop.
It has to do with Conant's
conception of what he
calls "academic independence."
Within this broad generalization
he offers his defense against
those who believe that universities
might well have accepted more
responsibility for the detection
and elimination of Communistic
teaching and what he
calls "crypto-Communist"
teachers.

I can realize that a great
deal of exaggeration has attended
recent criticism of colleges and
universities on
this score. There has been far
less teaching of a subversive
nature than has been charged.
But it will not hurt to eliminate
what there is, nor will it quiet
criticism to treat
these charges as does Conant.

★

For, in the first place, he
says that people who criticize
the economic and social
philosophy now common in
university teaching on the
ground that it is unsound or
Socialistic (not Communistic)
are subtly attempting to implant
the idea that Communism is
common in colleges. This is
flatly not true. There
are responsible critics (and I
am one) who make that criticism
with good proof, and
Communism has nothing to
do with it.

Nor is it assuming the responsibility
that should accompany
freedom for Conant
to say on one page that the
university will not investigate
its own staff to find if
there are "crypto-Communists"
there while he can offer
no more than his "belief" that
there are none.

If they are there, he says,
"I hope the government will
ferret them out and prosecute
them." But he also
makes it clear that what goes
on in the university is none
of the government's business.
That is what he means by
"independence."

★

There is also a confusion
throughout in his treatment
of "freedom" and "liberty."
If he will consult the ripe
wisdom of George Santayana,
he will find in the last book
of that great product of the
pre-Conant age of Harvard,
"Domination and Powers," a
clear distinction between
"freedom" and "liberty":
"Freedom . . . is only a condition
for the exercise of true
liberty." Liberty is the exercise
of self-examination, self-
restraint and self-government.
The Conant claim is
for a freedom that he is not
willing to earn.
