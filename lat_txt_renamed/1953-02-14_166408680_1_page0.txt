A Senate subcommittee
now produces evidence of
the most disgraceful of all
the smears against Richard
Nixon that began with the
revelation in September of
the fund raised by friends in
his behalf.
This new one, which in-
volves a letter bearing the
marks of forgery, may now
be traced to its origin and
result in richly deserved
punishment, for the whole
business now goes to the De-
partment of Justice.
The details of this attack
have appeared in the press
and are incorporated in a
moving and informative ac-
count of the whole Nixon af-
fair by Richard Wilson in the
current issue of Look.
The letter involved was
purported to have been writ-
ten by an official of a Cali-
fornia oil company to an offi-
cial of an eastern oil com-
pany in 1950. Its import is
that people in the oil indus-
try were going to pay $52,000
to Nixon in the course of
that year.

This letter, according to
the testimony before the sub-
committee, was transmitted
with a covering letter by a
Los Angeles public relations
man to a New York public
relations man. The New York
man then is said to have
taken it to the New York
Post and the Democratic Na-
tional Committee. Both of
these were unable to authen-
ticate the letter from the oil
man, and it was not used.
The Los Angeles public
relations man claims that he
never wrote a letter or trans-
mitted the forgery to the
New York man.
It is not stated in the Look
article, but it is in the com-
mittee record that several
days before the election the
California oil company
learned of the alleged letter
and vigorously pursued the
subject, warning newspapers
and others against using it.
This effort may well have pre-
vented a use of the forgery at
the 11th hour in the cam-
paign. It may well be that, ex-
cept for these warnings, many
votes might have been
changed by as despicable a
trick as has ever occurred in
American politics.
This new revelation ex-
plains the ominous rumbling
during October that "some-
thing much more damaging
to Nixon" was to come out.
Many voters were thrown
into a state of nerves like
that of a man waiting for the
other shoe to fall.

These rumors, according to
the Look article, were accel-
erated by "Democratic politi-
cos," who "started a whisper-
ing campaign that something
new and dire was about to
be disclosed."
This matter of the letter,
however, was the most seri-
ous but not the only under-
hand attempt to smear Nix-
on and defeat the Eisenhow-
er-Nixon ticket. There was
the story that "Nixon and his
family" owned a fortune in
real estate. This proved to
be shocking distortion. There
was the story of Nixon's trip
with Dana C. Smith to Ha-
vana, which was disproved.
Also, the story of a sworn
statement by Pat Nixon in
behalf of her and her hus-
band concerning their joint
property. This came out later
as a case of mistaken identity.
No one can expect as an
aftermath of all this any
soul searching by those who
so bitterly pursued Nixon
with these smears, for their
past history raises doubts
about their concern for pro-
fessional ethics.
But the newspaper and
broadcasting agencies that
were used for the purpose of
making these charges might
well revise their standards of
accuracy and fairness. For
without those agencies such
charges could not reach any
appreciable part of the public.
