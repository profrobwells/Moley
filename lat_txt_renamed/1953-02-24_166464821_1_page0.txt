Despite the critical re-
marks of Adlai Stevenson
about Republican foreign pol-
icy, it is likely that the first
real party debate will not be
in the field of international
relations. It is more likely to
be concerned with farm pol-
And the beginning of that
is now evident in the attacks
on Secretary Benson. Presi-
dent Eisenhower noted the
primacy of this issue by men-
tioning it first in his first
Press conference.
It is interesting to note,
however, that the outcry
against the Secretary of Ag-
riculture is coming from
members of Congress and not
from the big farm organiza-
tions. It does not greatly mat-
ter what comes from the radi-
cal Farm Union, but the
Grange and the Farm Bureau
Federation are important.
The head of the Farm Bu-
reau, Allan Kline, could hard-
ly be expected to complain at
this early date in the life of
the Eisenhower administra-
tion, for, after all, Benson's
St. Paul speech fairly well
paralleled Kline's often-re-
peated statement of funda-
mental farm policy.

The phrase singled out for
most of the criticism was Ben-
son's designation of farm
price supports as "disaster in-
surance." Kline's position,
which he has stated in many
places, is that price supports
are designed exactly for the
purpose stated by Benson-to
prevent disaster. The follow-
ing statement of Kline, made
in 1950, is typical of the Farm
Bureau philosophy:
"The American Farm Bu-
reau Federation believes in
price supports for agricultural
commodities, but it believes
that these supports should be
flexible enough to reflect the
realities of supply and de-
mand. They should prevent
unreasonable price declines,
but they should not encour-
age uneconomic production
or lead to continuing rigid
controls over individual farm
operations. The government
support price should be an
assurance against disaster,
but it should not be the price
the farmer expects to live
on.
"But hope of agriculture
rests on individual oppor-
tunity, freedom and produc-
tivity. To farmers, the first
essential for prosperity is
that those outside agriculture
be highly productive, in order
that they can buy farm prod-
ucts, and in order that they
can supply abundant goods
and services at reasonable
prices to the farmer. Farm-
ers, in turn, must be highly
productive if they are to have
a firm claim on society for a
high standing of living."
Benson in his St. Paul
speech said this:
"Our agricultural policy
should aim to obtain, in the
market place, full parity
prices of farm products and
parity incomes for farm peo-
ple so that farmers will have
freedom to operate efficiently
and to adjust their production
to changing consumer de-
mands in an expanding econ-
omy. This objective cannot be
assured by government pro-
grams alone. It can be
achieved only with a steady
level of prices, high employ-
ment and production, and ris-
ing output per worker in our
total national economy."

It is true that the Eisen-
hower-Benson farm regime
inherited a declining market
in several products, notably
beef. That decline was nota-
ble a year ago, but it was a
decline from an excessively
high peak.
In January, 1952, the price
of beef cattle had dropped
from 141% of parity to 129%.
When Eisenhower was in-
augurated, beef prices stood
at something close to 90%. In
the next four weeks it was
about 85% in general, al-
though in some localities it
was lower.
The hope of the administra-
tion is that by dispelling
panic selling by farmers and
by increasing purchases for
the armed forces and for relief
to the flooded areas of
Europe the decline can be
stopped. There is, however,
no approach to what Kline
and Benson have called "dis-
aster."
