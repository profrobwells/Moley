James Cash Penney has
sold a lot to the Americans,
but he has never sold a bet-
ter product than he is doing
now, with 77 years resting
lightly on his shoulders.
He is telling the people a
home, millions of whom prac-
tice economy at his hundred;
of stores, that all they save
in that way will be lost un-
less local communities stop
clamoring for money from
Washington.
Penney has organized what
he calls the National Coun-
cil for Community Improve-
ment. He hopes that this na-
tional organization will pro-
liferate into hundreds of local
councils dedicated to the prop-
osition that the surest way to
tax relief is to check local
pressures on Congress for
things that local communities
can well do without.
★
Penney himself is promot-
ing the work of the council
by going from city to city
exhorting community leaders
to get behind this movement.
No one who knows the story
of this man's incredible ca-
reer in putting his stores in-
to the large and small cities
of the land will discount this
crusade as the effort of a well-
meaning but impractical ideal-
ist. I cannot venture to state
the number of stores in his
chain, because before this
piece goes into print three or
four more will probably
spring up. But at the moment,
the number is close to 1700.
The Penney formula is sim-
ple. The leading spirits of the
community should organize
a council and that council
should get over to the people
the truth that Federal econo-
my must begin at home. For
if Chambers of Commerce and
labor unions and parent-
teacher associations and the
like keep yammering for
handouts, Congressmen will
keep on voting them.

Of course, the efforts of
Penney will not avail unless
some help comes from Presi-
dent Eisenhower. For the
President can respond to a
national need, Congress is, on
the contrary, responsive to
the thousands of local inter-
ests.
Putting it another way, the
President represents the pub-
lic interest; Congress, the
public's interests. There is a
whale of a difference here.
For the public's interests are
selfish, multifarious, im-
mensely strong.
The President in his con-
cern can make it clear to the
vast bureaucracy that it
should stop needling local
people to put pressure on
Congress for this or that.
★
Specifically, this means be-
ginning with the Army, with
which the President should
be familiar. It has been the
grave defect in that fine body,
the Army Engineers Corps,
that many of its members
have been indefatigable nee-
dlers and politicians at the lo-
cal level. If the President is
unaware of this, he should
ask his good friend, Gen.
Clay, who knows all about it.
This business of whetting lo-
cal appetites should be
stopped.
Then the President should
lay down the law to the Bu-
reau of Reclamation. The
swarming public relations
agents of that bureau operate
almost everywhere, creating
work and politicking for ap-
propriations. Then the proc-
ess should go through all the
government departments.
With this help and an-
awakened concern at the lo-
cal level, we may have a bal-
anced budget and lower taxes,
too.
