TRUMAN AS
AUTHOR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It may be a source of pride
for professional journalists to
witness the mad desire of re-
tired political big shots to
break into their business.
These distinguished rug-
tives from office during their
public service have often
been bitter critics of the press
and its commentators. Their
attitude, as in the case of
F. D. R., was that most news-
paper writers were the plain
tools of the moneybags be-
hind their papers. Some, as
in the case of Defense Secre-
tary Wilson, have expressed
measured contempt for writ-
ing men. But when darkness
closes 'round the great white
throne of public office and a
cold world greets those who
have lived off public bounty,
they are almighty glad to get
a chance to write.
Latest to enter the service
of Clio is Harry S. Truman.
Despite the uncomfortable
fact that the book, "Mr. Pres-
ident," originally selling for
$5 plus sales tax in some
places, Mr. Truman has bold-
ly announced his plans to
write his memoirs and has a
contract providing him with
sizable compensations for se-
rial rights thereto.

Of course, the writing of
memoirs may not be classed
as journalism. Literary value
depends upon the craft exer-
cised in writing. Value as a
source book depends upon the
degree to which the historian
overcomes the ingrained reti-
cence of the politician. Sales
value depends upon the ex-
tent to which after two years
there will be public curiosity
about the Truman recollec-
tion.
Adlai Stevenson, too, has
been approached, it is said,
with offers of writing oppor-
tunity. But, as in the case
of so many decisions in the
Stevenson career, he is not
certain and may be waiting
for a draft.
There are mixed reasons
why ex-public officials take
to writing. Prominent among
them is the worthy desire to
make money. Grant, for ex-
ample, spent his tortured
dying years on his memoirs
in order to ease his economic
distress. In earlier days men
like Jefferson, John Adams
and Madison wrote copious-
ly, but in the form of letters.

T. R. wrote vigorously and
profitably after his Presi-
dency. But it should be noted
that he was a vigorous,
trained writer before he en-
tered public life. That was
true of Winston Churchill.
The efforts of Coolidge and
Al Smith to do regular stints
of writing were not very suc-
cessful and were soon dis-
continued. Harold Ickes and
Fiorello La Guardia tried it
after leaving public office.
Their product showed dimin-
ishing interest in their work.
In sum, the careers of re-
tired politicians as writers
have not been bright. The
initial pay that many have
received has not been justi-
fied by the intrinsic value of
their work. It was payment
for a reputation earned in
another profession. It was
justified as a publishing ex-
pense by public curiosity.
But curiosity sales are
short-lived. Later, the out-
put must rest upon hard
labor and craftsmanship
learned only in writing ex-
perience. Public men are
neither trained that way,
nor are they capable of the
sustained work involved in
supplying the public with in-
teresting news and readable
comment.
It may seem to the reader
to be an easy task to write
such copy. But the degree to
which writing seems easy to
a reader depends upon the
amount of labor it takes to
write that way.
