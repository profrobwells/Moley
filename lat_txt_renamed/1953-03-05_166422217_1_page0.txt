EDUCATORS
AND REDS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It would be one of the most
unfortunate and unnecessary
injuries to the domestic tran-
quillity of this country if the
present controversy concern-
ing radical or pro-Communist
teaching in our educational
institutions should take on
any aspect of a religious con-
troversy.
For the root trouble has
nothing to do with religion. It
is political in the classic
sense. It concerns the preser-
vation of our constitutional
system of liberty, not only in
speech and worship but in
the exercise of the rights of
property in a free country. It
also has to do with the es-
sence of Republican govern-
ment.
*
All these are threatened by
Marxism in all its forms,
whether Communistic or in
its milder form of Socialism.
There are those who in their
protest against the concern
of Congress over the now
evident fact of Communists
in our colleges think only of
preserving freedom of speech
and, as they call it, "of in-
quiry."
They forget or have not
realized that our liberties are
indivisible. If we impair our
constitutional system in
many other ways—by de-
stroying the constitutional
balance between the Federal
government and the States,
by permitting powerful in-
terests to limit the individu-
al's economic freedom, and by
substituting for our party
system a Congress of pres-
sure groups—we shall reach
a point where speech and in-
quiry will die or merely live
an innocuous existence.
Some people would keep
the gate in order while they
are blind to the disintegra-
tion of the fence.
*
Some of the outcries about
academic freedom also refuse
to recognize that Congress
has an obligation to protect
national security. Current
Congressional inquiries are
not directed toward mere im-
pairment of our constitution-
al system by Marxist econom-
ics.
James B. Conant, in his
final report as president of
Harvard, said that, while he
favored the exercise of every
care to see that Communists
were not appointed to univer-
sity positions, he did not rec-
ognize any duty on the part
of the university to investi-
gate "a professor's activities
as a citizen."
He said that if such mem-
bers of the staff are "in fact
engaged in subversive activi-
ties, I hope the government
will ferret them out and
prosecute them." He then
said that no government
agency should inquire into
"the nature of the instruc-
tion," presumably in the
classroom.
*
This is not in line with the
responsibility which Presi-
dent Eisenhower asserts that
he assumed as president of
Columbia. He freely admit-
ted the responsibility of the
university authorities to de-
termine for themselves
whether they were employing
subversive people and, if they
discovered them, to fire them.
The issue, therefore, is a
matter of the responsibility
of college and university au-
thorities to determine
whether they employ people
who are not responsive to
"free inquiry" but to an alien
conspiracy or, in fact, wheth-
er they employ people who
are giving aid and comfort
to an alien conspiracy.
It is not a religious issue.
