An Educator With Good
Answers on Communism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are two very bad
ways for college officials to
meet the issue of a Congressional
inquiry into the Communistic
affiliations of teachers. Many
educators have adopted one or
the other and in so doing have
won little public support and
certainly have added no luster to
American education.
The first has been to scream
loudly to the effect that academic
freedom is endangered by
"witch hunts" or "McCarthyism"
or "Jennerism." In short, to
defy and denounce the Congress
of the United States.
The other is illustrated by the
specious indirectness of James B.
Conant in his final report as
president of Harvard and in his
replies to questions by Sen.
Ferguson when his nomination
for the German post was under
consideration.
Conant's position was (a) that
he favored trying to keep
Communists from being appointed,
(b) but if Communists should be
on the staff it would be damaging
to the university to hunt for them,
(c) and if there were any on the
staff engaged in subversive
activities it would be the duty of
the government "to ferret them
out," (d) anyhow, the authorities
of the university should not try to
investigate a professor's activities
outside the classroom, and (e) the
government had better keep its
nose out of the colleges.

This is not a position. It is a
series of positions which seem to
me to involve a series of
contradictions. It is not facing
up to the responsibility an
academic administration owes to
its students, the parents of its
students, the supporters of the
institutions and the public and
the nation.
A refreshing contrast to both
these attitudes is the position
recently announced by President
Millicent C. McIntosh of Barnard
College, Columbia University.
President McIntosh lives close to
this problem, which in some other
institutions in the city of New
York has assumed serious
proportions.
A group of students propounded
a series of questions. I reduce
President McIntosh's answers to
simple "Yes" or "No" with, I
hope, no injury to the sense of
what she said.
Do you believe that faculty
members should be compelled to
answer the question: Are you or
have you ever been a member of
the Communist Party? Yes.
If there were a Communist on
the Barnard College faculty, do
you believe that the trustees
would take steps to remove such
a person? Yes.

Do such investigations, as the
Senate subcommittee one, portend
ominously for academic freedom
and the liberal education tradition
of American colleges and universities?
No, if properly handled by both
the committee and the institution.
President McIntosh then made
clear that the colleges and
universities "should take the
responsibility themselves for
seeing that their teaching is truly
free and not dictated by any
outside authority." In the context,
the Communist Party might be such
"outside authority."
This is the best and clearest
statement of responsibility I have
seen coming from any educator. It
makes clear the fact that since a
Communist is not able to be free,
he should not enjoy the immunity
of free men, that any Communist,
regardless of what he is teaching,
should be dismissed, that government
has a right to investigate but that
the colleges should forestall such
investigations by their own responsible
vigilance.
If educators generally should
assume this attitude, there would
be less probing by Congress. For
Congress is, after all, responsive to
public opinion, and public opinion
would support responsible educators.
It will not, however, support
equivocators or denunciations by
educators.
