ECONOMICS
RESTORED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No appointment yet made
by President Eisenhower
promises more for a restora-
tion of sound economic poli-
cies in Washington than that
of Arthur F. Burns as the
President's economic adviser.
The old council of econom-
ic advisers, headed by Leon
Keyserling, has been ousted
by the simple device of cut-
ting off the appropriation.
The selection of Burns
means that the President
will have as an adviser a
political economist and not
an economic politician.
Burns is a professor of eco-
nomics at Columbia Univer-
sity and also director of re-
search for the National Bu-
reau of Economic Research.
The latter is an institution
which has built up a magnifi-
cent reputation for the study
of fundamental economics.
This new adviser to the
President has definitely
chosen a policy quite at vari-
ance with that pursued by
Keyserling. His purpose is
not to fit his advice to any
specific political view, nor
will he himself engage in
partisan matters. He will not
even issue public statements
or make outside speeches.

Thus, the original purpose
of the President's council of
economic advisers is at long
last to be fulfilled. When that
body was created in 1946 it
was designed to provide the
President with scientific and
nonpolitical information and
advice. It was not supposed
to fit its information and ad-
vice to the lines of policy de-
termined by the President.
Edwin G. Nourse, a repu-
table economist, was the
first chairman. He served
three difficult years and re-
signed when he found that
under President Truman the
council could not operate as
"a professional and nonpo-
litical agency." After his de-
parture Keyserling became
chairman and adjusted his
thinking to the vagaries of
Trumanesque policy.
The economic views of
Burns might generally be
classed as conservative. In
his introduction to the annual
report of the National Bu-
reau of Economic Research
he made the following com-
ments in connection with the
presentation of a summary
of Prof. Simon Kuznets' prog-
ress report on his study of
national income:
"Few Americans and still
fewer Republicans are aware
of the transformation in the
distribution of our national
income that has occurred
within the last 20 years—a
transformation that has been
carried out peacefully and
gradually, but which may al-
ready be counted as one of
the great social revolutions
in history . . .

"If we are to look forward
constructively to a material
reduction of income inequali-
ties in the future we must
seek to attain it principally
by raising the productivity of
those at the bottom of the in-
come scale rather than by
transferring income from the
rich to the poor . . . There
can be no doubt that as high
incomes are cut a point must
come when private investors
have neither the will nor the
power to launch major inno-
vations.
"Substantial further redis-
tribution of incomes may
therefore affect adversely the
size of the national income,
while it cannot improve ap-
preciably the living condi-
tions of the great masses.
The paramount source of the
rising living standards of our
workers and farmers has al-
ways been an increasing vol-
ume of production, and in
the years ahead it bids fair
to become the only source."
It has been many a day
since any such sound and sci-
entific conclusion has been
held by anyone in the offices
of the White House.
