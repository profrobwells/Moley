The CIO-PAC is running in
its weekly publication a day-
by-day account of President
Eisenhower's occasional
hours off at the golf course.
This is the way some politi-
clans have of putting empha-
sis on petty stuff to arouse
the envy or prejudices of
petty people. Since there are
plenty of such in the world,
their votes are worth snar-
ing. It is, however, a pretty
contemptible way to play
politics.
Since the CIO has shown
in several campaigns that it
cannot hold its own card-car-
rying members in line at
election time, it might better
be engaged in some more im-
portant types of research.
Instead of looking into the
physical exercise of the Presi-
dent it might better be look-
ing into the mental habits of
some of its own leaders.
It should be added that this
idea of criticizing the Presi-
dent for playing golf may be
the child of the same brain
which in the Senatorial cam-
paign in Ohio in 1950 brought
out the damning fact that
Taft as a boy used to read in-
stead of playing games. Ap-
parently, in the moral code
of the CIO, you are wrong
whether you play or don't
play.

But, after all, the CIO is
young, and this is the first
time it has had a President
that it has wanted to criti-
cize. Of course, a good deal
might be said about the mat-
ter of vacations and playing.
The various demands of the
CIO for fringe benefits have
always contained generous
amounts of time for vacations
and the like.
This also raises the inter-
esting point that several
members of the Cabinet of
the Truman administration
collected money for vacations
that they did not take while
in office. Perhaps the CIO
would regard this as legiti-
mate overtime.
On the serious side it
should be said that the Presi-
dent must get some exercise
and relaxation because, as we
have learned by experience,
his health is a vital national
concern. Perhaps the CIO
overlooked that in 1944 when
it so vigorously supported
President Roosevelt in the
face of the fact that his offi-
cial physician said that he
could not survive unless he
took it easy—which was to
say that unless he retired he
would die. The fact proved
the diagnosis.

It can hardly be realized
by anyone who has not seen
the thing at firsthand what
a man-killing place the White
House really is. Hundreds
of administrative officers,
members of Congress, office
seekers, friends, and others
are begging at all times for
the limited waking minutes of
the President. The secretaries
and assistants in the White
House, who are supposed to
protect the President, are
themselves a frail wall
against the pressure of in-
fluence. Often they seek to
protect themselves by squeez-
ing in an extra minute or two
for someone with the boss.
A great load of stuff has to
be read by the President,
Roosevelt used to keep this
in a plain wire basket which
he carried to his bedroom
when he left the office. For
after the day’s work of seeing
people, shaking hands, getting
pictures taken with all sorts
of nuisances in behalf of this
or that, occasionally visiting
the sick and burying the
dead, signing commissions,
bills, letters and photographs,
making speeches to this or
for that, there may also be a
dinner to live through.
Then, after the rest of hu-
manity has called it a day,
the serious work of the Presi-
dent must begin. The docu-
ments must be read and deci-
sions must be made. And aft-
er eyes and hands and voice
are worn out the brain keeps
vigil. For there are matters
of a nation’s destiny to think
about which no one can de-
cide except the President.
It is nonsense to say that
a President can delegate his
work to the able men who
surround him. For these men
have differences among
themselves, and their differ-
ences always come to the
President.
