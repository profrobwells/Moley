Senators Learn About
the Cost of Psychology
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The general import of the
word "economy" is easy to
comprehend, and everyone
favors it. Its applications to
our personal affairs are easy
to define.
when we begin to think
about it in connection with
the Federal government, however, our eyes are blinded by
dust thrown out by the bureaucrats. They would have
you believe that every dollar
cut from the Truman levels
of spending brings the Red
army nearer to our shores
and exposes ourselves and
our children to the rapacity
of an alien conqueror.
They tell you that 75 or
80 or 85% of the money requested is for "past, present
or future wars." That is supposed to stop you in your
tracks because it means that
most of the requests are untouchable—a mystery
wrapped in a pentagon—and
that the remaining trifle of
15 or 20 or 25% is too small
to bother about.
The answer is that nothing
should be untouchable and
that in the small, nondefense
remainder are a few billions
worth saving.
A further point is that a
lot of stuff is camouflaged as
defense or warfare that isn't
defense or warfare at all.
Merely to call something
"psychological warfare" doesn't make it warfare, and to
call a thing "intelligence"
doesn't make it intelligent.

A good example of the
latter is a curious office in
the State Department headed by W. Park Armstrong
Jr., who is called in State
Department jargon "special
assistant for intelligence."
The justification for his expensive "office" or bureau or
what-not, after a searching
inquiry by the Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations
looked like a bed of violets
in which a group of boys had
been searching for a ball.
The Armstrong "intelligence" office had $2,671,180
for the year now nearly over.
It was authorized to hire
476 people. Under the Truman budget 620 people were
asked for, but under the
pressure of President Eisenhower's demand for economy
this request was cut to 419
people.
Sens. McCarran, Dirksen,
Ferguson and Ellender gave
Mr. Armstrong a hard time
explaining why his office was
necessary at all. The explanation left at least this observer completely skeptical.
In trying to explain what
his outfit does Mr. Armstrong sought refuge in "a
cloud of bureaucratic semantics. It deals with a strange
thing called "psychological
intelligence," which is not
the same as "current intelligence." Driven further into
the wilderness of double talk,
he said that "our mission is
to keep on top of political
developments... throughout
the world" and that he does
intelligence "not performed
by the individual departments."

It was not clear why the
Armstrong work could not be
done by the Central Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Armstrong's office, it
seems, also dabbles in Point
4 work. Sen. Dirksen asked
"Just what is intelligence on
Point 4?" and got this wholly
unintelligible answer:
"Primarily, Senator, that
would be the undertaking of
research reports with respect
to conditions in countries
where Point 4 programs were
contemplated, the analysis of
the basic economic and sociological problems that existed in a particular country
that would bear upon the
prospects for, or the need for,
the likelihood of success of a
Point 4 program."
Senators were still doubtful as to why Point 4 people
could not do that. In fact, the
only thing Sen. Dirksen could
see that 3398 Point 4 people
did was to wander around the
world teaching people "how
to spend our money."
Sen. Ellender couldn't see
why this work could not be
done by the innumerable attaches of the department.
There was no clear answer
to this. In fact, there was no
clarity about anything.
