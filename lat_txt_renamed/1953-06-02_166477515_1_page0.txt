A 'LIBERAL' IN ACTION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Many years of the ascend-
ancy in our government of
people who call themselves
"liberal" have taught us how
utterly illiberal they are. For
a liberal is, or rather was, a
person who believed in per-
sonal liberty and opposed the
growth of government.
The Americans for Demo-
cratic Action represent them-
selves as a group of "liber-
als." Their program is a long
series of proposals to enlarge
the power of government and
curtail the liberty of the in-
dividual. Apparently it now
has two heads or "cochair-
men," Arthur M. Schlesinger
Jr. and James E. Doyle. These
gentlemen issue statements
about public matters much as
is the habit of party chair-
men. This is, in fact, a po-
litical party locked in an un-
recognized alliance with the
present rulers of the Demo-
cratic Party.
The cochalrmen recently
denounced Sen. Taft for his
suggestion about going it
alone in Korea. They called
Taft "reckless" and "irrespon-
sible."
Without arguing the wis-
dom of Taft's suggestion, let
us see who is using these
terms "reckless" and "irre-
sponsible."

According to a report in the
New York Times, Prof. Schles-
inger and Francis Biddle,
former ADA chairman, had a
news conference at the re-
cent convention of that organ-
ization. Denunciation of Sen.
McCarthy was, of course, the
theme of their talk. Then
Prof. Schlesinger took up the
question of what to do about
McCarthy. The Times thus
describes what he said:
"In a discussion of Presi-
dent Eisenhower's relations
with Sen. McCarthy, Mr.
Schlesinger, a frequent target
of the Wisconsin Republican,
suggested the new Republi-
can President might well
study the tactics used by the
late President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in reducing the
political power of Sen. Huey
P. Long, Democrat of Louisi-
ana, who later was assassi-
nated.
"He said President Roose-
velt had administration Sena-
tors counterattack Sen. Long
on the Senate floor, and also
cause an investigation to be
BRANDEL
Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
made of Sen. Long's income
tax returns. All this helped
to 'isolate' Sen. Long and
render him impotent political-
ly,' he declared."
★
The fact that Prof. Schles-
inger is not quite accurate
about the Roosevelt-Long his-
tory is not relevant to the
real issue raised by this reck-
less and irresponsible state-
ment.
The real point is that such
a method of attack is a viola-
tion of every principle of
true liberalism. The use of
the vast power of the income
tax to silence critics is to in-
stitute a ruthless totalitarian
tyranny. And to attempt to
induce Senators to harass and
isolate one of their number
would put the President into
the position of turning or-
derly government into a dis-
cordant brawl.
This is apparently what we
may expect if the false liber-
als should again attain power.
