There are two sources of
opposition to the President's
plans for the reorganization
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--
one from those who fear a
weakening of civilian control
over the military and the
other, some Army and Air
Force people who fear that
under Adm. Radford the
Navy will have too much
power. Both deserve con-
sideration.
The second objection goes
back to the old but still lusty
rivalry among the services.
The President's message
transmitting his reorganiza-
tion plan provides that the
chairman must approve the
selection by the three Chiefs
of personnel for the staff. This
centralizes authority and pro-
vides for greater efficiency
but it also would permit the
chairman, who would under
the law be a serviceman him-
self, substantially to select
the staff. For the power to
approve ultimately means
the power to select.
With the spirit of loyalty
in the services as it is and
as it shoud be, it can hardly
be assumed that an admiral
or a general would be neutral.
This objection could be re-
moved if the present plan of
a serviceman as chairman
were changed to provide a
civilian chairman. The law
could be altered by giving the
Secretary of Defense another
undersecretary whose duty
it would be to serve as chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs.
Assuming the neutrality of
that person, two purposes
would be served: assured ci-
vilian control and detach-
ment from the prejudices and
traditions of any one service.
The argument that the
plan would build up a dan-
gerous and militaristic gen-
eral staff on the Prussian
model is not so clear. The
German general staff was a
very efficient instrument, as
we learned very well in two
wars. It was blundering gov-
ernment at the top, first by
the Kaiser and then by Hit-
ler, that brought wars and
ruin. And there was in Ger-
many no such panoply of
civilian authority as Presi-
dent Eisenhower mentions.
However, the provision of
a civilian chairman would be
an added protection against
the irresponsible use of pow-
er by the Joint Chiefs' or-
ganization.
The President's reorgani-
zation plan removes from
the Joint Chiefs a large
amount of administrative de-
tail, which is given over to
the Secretary of Defense.
Thus, the Joint Chiefs' staff
becomes an expert planning
and advisory body, operating
at all times under the au-
thority of the Defense Sec-
retary and the President.
As long as we are, as the
President reminds us, moving
into a long period during
which we shall be armed and
ready, it would seem to be
the part of wisdom to have
such a permanent military
planning unit. But it should
follow tradition in being at
all times completely subservi-
ent to civil authority.
