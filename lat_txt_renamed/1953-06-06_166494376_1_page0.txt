The ardors of the climb and
the glories of the summit are
what we shall hear most
about in the forthcoming
Everest story. But the real
peril in such an adventure
is the descent.
On the ascent, the goal is
in plain sight. On the return,
the trail is difficult to retrace.
The perils of navigation are
added to the dangers of terrain.
In Maurice Herzog's conquest
of Annapurna, the disasters
were in the descent.
So it will be with Eisenhower's
doughty financial mountaineers
in getting down from the
inflationary peak upon which
our economy is so precariously
perched.
Franklin Roosevelt tried to
check inflation in 1937 by attacking
the price of copper, and the
result was the sharpest recession
in history. All that saved him
and us from a real crash was
rearmament.
The Treasury and other financial
advisers in the Eisenhower
administration are at work letting
some of the air out of the boom.
They are seeking to balance the
budget by cutting expenditures,
by avoiding tax reductions, and
by raising interest rates.
Thus, the two goals are (a) the
abandonment of deficit financing
and (b) the establishment of a
free market for government bonds.
But this return to financial orthodoxy
carries a very great danger if it
is abruptly adopted.
If the resulting deflation seems
to be dangerous, they plan to
ease credit, increase spending,
and to cut taxes.
Keen observers who have seen
many years of government finance
shiver a bit when they see this
apparent confidence that inflation
and deflation can be turned on and
off with such ease and with such
levers. They point to danger signals
already apparent.
The 3¾ bond issue is not behaving
according to expectations. The
government thought the issue would
sell well above par. That Wall
Street thought so, too, is shown by
the fact that the issue was greatly
oversubscribed. But these choice
bits of paper are selling below par,
and 2½s are around 90.
The money market will certainly
tighten as June 15 approaches, and
many quite orthodox financial people
believe the Federal Reserve must do
something to ease the situation.
Finally, the problem comes back
to the budget. It becomes more and
more obvious that the Bureau of the
Budget, the Treasury, and the
President have all too readily accepted
the idea that because the expenditure
of some $80,000,000,000 is authorized
provision must be made to pay out
that entire sum.
That huge sum is not entirely an
inescapable obligation. A careful and
courageous going over of those authorizations
would reveal a large number that
might be canceled out. This review
does not seem to have been made.
Moreover, the departments, with some
exceptions, have not yet cut deeply
enough.
And so the route to a balanced
budget via cutting expenditures has
not been cleared. That being true, the
administration may find that a deficit
now is better than a recession a little
later.
