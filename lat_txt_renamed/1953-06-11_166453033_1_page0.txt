INVASION
OF PARIS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The last time Sen. Dirksen
saw Paris he wondered who
and what so many American
government employees were
doing there. And so when
representatives of the State
Department appeared before
him in a meeting of an
Appropriations Subcommittee
he attempted to get an an-
swer to the question that had
troubled 'him in Paris.
If he now feels that he has
the whole answer, I should
be surprised. For consider-
able research has failed to
provide me with the exact
number of people-aliens and
Americans-who are spend-
ing my tax money on and off
the boulevards of that most
beautiful city.

Moreover, if the Senator
should have found his an-
swer it would have been as
of April, when the hearings
were held.
In March a group of able
American businessmen
returned from Europe and sub-
mitted a report to Mutual
Security Director Stassen on
what they found in Europe.
They, too, were astonished
the last time they saw Paris.
But they found many more
employees of our government
than did the people questioned
by Dirksen.
The businessmen's report
said this: "In Paris there are
49 different agencies, mostly
military, employing a total of
4749 people-2213 of whom
are Americans. Parisians re-
fer to this as the great Ameri-
can invasion. Another very
large agency is now planning
on moving to the Paris area.

"Multiple ambassadors in
any foreign country com-
pound confusion. In Paris
calling on one French official
on the same subject at one
time were five U.S. ambassa-
dors, four of whom were per-
manently located in Paris."
Dirksen's questions first
elicited the figure 396 em-
ployed by the State Depart-
ment in Paris. But Sen. Fer-
guson pressed on a bit and
elicited the fact that there
were 75 more employed by
USIE. That is the United
States Information and Edu-
cational Service.
Fellow citizens! That is not
IAA, which is another "in-
formation" service that you
are paying for. You are pay-
ing for 231 IAA people.
Then there was discovered
the SRE-Special Represen-
tative in Europe-employing
1400, minus some who had
been dropped since they were
last counted. Dirksen noted
1000 employed as a guess.
Then there was the Mutual
Security Administration with
221.

Later the State Depart-
ment people were questioned
about the military staff in the
Embassy. There were 80, but
since they were paid by the
Defense Department, the
State Department had no re-
sponsibility for them.
Then, out of the mass of
budget figures, there popped
MAAG-a military advisory
group with 191 more. That
does not include SHAPE.
Of course, there must be
lots of people in Washington
to "process" what all these
people send back. But the
foregoing gives us a rough
idea of what it costs to "sell"
America in Paris.
