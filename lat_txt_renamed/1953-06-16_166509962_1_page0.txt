SLAPPING A,
HELPING B
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Once upon a time-way
back when the Korean police
action was new-there was a
Congress that did a deal of
talking about how it wanted
to help two sorts of people-
small businessmen, generally
and, in particular, veterans
who wanted to succeed in
life. But a great fear seized
upon that Congress when
shooting began in Korea, and
it passed an excess profits
tax.
This EPT, it was said, was
to "take the profits out of
war." It was, however, a
fraudulent tax. It has been
embellished by good men
like Messrs. Eisenhower,
Taft, Humphrey, Sparkman,
Snyder, Vinson and others
with a long list of abusive
adjectives from "bad" to "un-
fair" to "vicious." But now
the people who know it is
bad want Congress to ex-
tend the badness six months
more.

Maybe Congress will do so,
because Congress has a con-
sistent capacity for doing in-
consistent things. Let me il-
lustrate.
The other day, the House
passed a bill setting up a
Small Business Administra-
tion, with $250,000,000 for
loans, etc. Stripped of flossy
excuses, this was a measure
based on politics, not eco-
nomics, to make help easier
for businesses that could not
get help anywhere else. Of
course, it would put another
$250,000,000 in the budget.
But what is economy among
politicians? Our point here is
that its title should be "An
Act to Help the Inefficient."
In 1950, as I have noted
above, Congress passed a bill
that should have been "An
Act to Hurt the Efficient."
There cannot be any pos-
sible consistency in pretend-
ing to sympathize with small,
growing businesses while im-
posing a tax designed to lay
a penalty on small busi-
nesses.
*
Let us get one point
straight. The EPT is not a
measure against "big bad
business." The big, long-es-
tablished companies are not
seriously affected. Nor is the
opposition to a continuance
centered in the machinations
of business groups.
For example, 84 members
of the board of the National
Association of Manufacturers
voted recently to go along
with the President on con-
tinuing EPT; 46 voted to per-
mit it to die on June 30. De-
spite this, the NAM high
command stated its opposi-
tion to Congress. The Com-
mittee for Economic Devel-
opment favors continuing the
tax. The Chamber of Com-
merce wants it ended. Last
year a poll of the members
of the NAM showed that
78.6% of those who were pay-
ing the tax employed less
than 500 people.
Moreover, it is a tax that
falls heavily, cruelly, upon
companies started by people
who came out of the war in
1945 and 1946. In determining
the tax, the issue is the
amount of profits made now
by comparison with the aver-
age of the best three years in
the four years 1946-49 inclu-
sive.
So if a man started his busi-
ness in 1946 and, as is usual,
made little or nothing dur-
ing the first three or four
years, the tax hits him hard,
while his competitor who was
well under way long before
1946 is not greatly affected.
It certainly is not a tax on
"war" profits alone. It hits
every business.
And, most important, it en-
courages gross waste through
extravagant business manage-
ment and expense accounts.
It is probable that much more
would accrue to the govern-
ment in taxes if there were
only the normal corporation
tax for all. For the amount
spent in lavish management
is lost forever to the govern-
ment,
The way to help small busi-
ness is to take off its shack-
les, not to buy it a crutch.
