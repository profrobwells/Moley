They Attempt to Alienate
Congress and President
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
An old acquaintance, who
was one of the five or six peo-
ple closest to F.D.R. until the
end in 1945, stopped by my
table in a restaurant recent-
ly.
After the usual greeting,
he said: "Aren't you alarmed
about the rising dictatorship
of Congress over the execu-
tive in Washington?" I might
have answered that after the
efforts of F. D. R. to subju-
gate Congress in his day, my
capacity for alarm was shat-
tered. But I merely asked
what he meant.
"Here's an example," he
answered, "Bridges telling
Stassen not to make commit-
ments abroad without notify-
ing the Appropriations Com-
mittee."
"This," he continued, "is
the whole trend. Congress is
riding high, wide and hand-
some."
I didn't argue the point,
but after some reflection a
pattern of opinion began to
shape itself. The ideas of my
old acquaintance, of course,
represented the opposition to
the regime in Washington
that won the last election.
With a popular President,
that opposition must refrain
from direct attack upon him.
The strategy must be an ef-
fort to create friction be-
tween Eisenhower and Con-
gress. Hence, demands from
all sides that the President
"crack down" on Congress
and its leaders. Hence, the
chatter that crosses the coun-
try whenever there is a hint
that Taft and Eisenhower
disagree.

This is, however, only a
symptom of a deep current of
opinion that has been flowing
for years. Witness the con-
tinuous attack on Congress
by Truman, and before that
the occasional blast by
F. D. R. Witness the effec-
tiveness of the attacks on "Re-
publican leadership" in Con-
gress in one Presidential
campaign after another—
never very serious, direct at-
tacks on the Republican can-
didate for President. In 1948
it was Truman vs. the 80th
Congress, not Truman vs.
Dewey.
This effort to discredit rep-
resentative government is an
exceedingly serious matter.
It has appeared before in his-
tory. Echoes of Octavius and
the Roman Senate come to
mind, and Cromwell the "Pro-
tector" and Parliament.
Bear in mind that in all
such cases the executive ex-
alted himself by claiming, as
did Cromwell, that he was a
"protector" of the people.
And again and again the folly
of the people is to believe that
their representatives—their
chosen delegates—have no
substance, no intelligence, no
integrity. These representa-
tives, these Congressmen are
known to the people. They
are of them, they live with
them, they know them well.
But "the faraway hills are
green."

Some businessmen are al-
ready talking about the need
for "strong leadership." They
are caviling at Congress for
inaction. But they should re-
member that over and over
in the last 20 years it has
been Congress, not the Pres-
ident, that has saved them.
Fortunately, Dwight D. El-
senhower is a man who has
decided to get on with Con-
gress. After last Sunday's
speeches by the President, the
reports all featured "book-
burning." But in the after-
noon, in speaking at Oyster
Bay, the President said that
we are too prone to picture
Theodore Roosevelt as "a
swashbuckler" who "in his
relationship with the Con-
gress rushed into the
Senate or the House, demand-
ed what he wanted, and rode
out with everyone cowed."
"No," continued Eisenhow-
er, "he was a wise leader."
Nothing could be more
clear than that the President
meant that to apply to him-
self.
