WHAT IS FOREIGN AID?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A well-known Congressman
not given to exaggeration rendered
the private opinion the
other day that, as long as anything
like the present scale
of foreign aid continues, there
will not be and cannot be a
balanced budget.
It is an interesting coincidence
that even if the President
gets his tax proposals,
the deficit will be almost exactly
as much as is now contemplated
for "foreign aid."
The term "foreign aid" covers
an infinite variety of services
and, if you would believe
some people, a multitude
of sins.
★
It may clarify some of the
confusion that exists to specify
some of the gifts, loans
and services included in this
all-embracing term. Even so,
a goodly part of the mystery
will survive because of the
thoroughly dishonest way
that the Roosevelt and Truman
administrations had of
misusing names.
The most barefaced of all
frauds was to call the aid we
gave beginning in 1941 "lend-
lease." It was neither lending
nor leasing. F. D. R. said it
was like lending your neighbor
a garden hose to put out a
fire. That was to sweeten the
pill and, as was the case with
most of Roosevelt's pills, it
was swallowed without even
a drink of water.
★
The neighbor never
dreamed of returning the
hose. No doubt F. D. R. had
no thought of recovering it.
Now the hose is being used
for all sorts of things other
than putting out a fire. Lend-
lease was still being given in
1952.
Then there were "civilian
supply grants," the UNRRA,
the post-UNRRA and "interim
aid."
There were the International
Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. The
bank was for "development."
But the Marshall Plan was
later developed for the same
purpose.
There were Far Eastern
aid and Korean aid.
There was "technical cooperation"
under that vague
concept of uplift called
Point 4.
★
There was the mutual defense
assistance program for
the Greeks, the Turks and
the Chinese.
Finally, Congress in 1951
gathered most of these under
the mutual security program.
All this a part of the shuffling
and reshuffling that is
so natural in a bureaucracy.
And there are also miscellaneous
programs of various
sorts.
The total for all purposes
over the entire period 1941-52
inclusive has been $57,000,-
000,000. Of that, $19,223,000,-
000 was during 1941-45. The
rest has been expended in
two rather distinct periods—
pre-Korea, $28,186,000,000, and
post-Korea, $9,016,000,000.
In 1945-50 the major purposes
were relief, recovery
and economic development.
After Korea military aid became
predominant.
★
In a most interesting summary
of our foreign aid programs
made by the Tax
Foundation the pertinent
comment is made that any
appraisal of the value of this
aid is impossible because we
have been "trading very tangible
aid for intangible returns."
Nobody can prove the extent
to which European recovery
has been due to this
aid. Europe has recovered
rapidly from so low a status.
In any event there has been
recovery to a degree where,
aside from military aid and
limited technical assistance,
the wisdom of the further extension
of these programs is
highly doubtful.
