There is so much talk of
politics in Washington these
days that the voice of justice
can scarcely be heard at all.
Indeed, it seems generally to
be taken for granted that
whatever is fair and just is
ipso facto bad politics.
If you say to one of the
wiseacres around Congress or
the administration that a cer-
tain economic policy is not
only fair but clearly in con-
formity with the laws of eco-
nomics you are likely to have
this answer:
"Yes, it is the right course
but it is bad politics. You are
too idealistic. We have to be
practical down here."
These worldly wisemen
should learn that honesty and
justice pay here in politics as
well as in the hereafter. That
is, if they are made clear to
the public. It was the people
last summer and fall who
were using the slogan "You
Never Had It So Good" who
lost. Enough people refused
to vote for their stomachs and
pocketbooks to repudiate that
slogan.
But the materialistic con-
tagion seems now to have af-
flicted their visitors.

Another breed of worldly
wisemen lives in Wall Street.
Their political judgment is
almost always wrong. And
their economic judgment is
not infallible. But they al-
ways follow their selfish in-
terests with what intelligence
they have. They are now
busy second-guessing the
Treasury and the Federal Re-
serve Board.
But, as I noted in this col-
umn a while ago, they fa-
vored the 3¼% interest rate
because they oversubscribed
the issue fivefold.
There is simple justice in
higher interest rates.
For years the Roosevelt-
Truman regime followed a
course of impoverishing some
for the aggrandizement of
others, not only by its ruth-
less use of the income tax
and by deficit spending but
by artificially manipulating
the interest rate. The result
has been shocking injustice
to those who must live on
income from bonds.

Let's look at the way
things have been with four
people—a factory worker, a
farmer, a bondholder and a
stockholder. For purposes of
calculation I assume that all
these are married. And let's
start with 1939, when each
had an income of $1500. Be-
cause of inflation and taxes
those people would have to
have had $3370 in 1952 to
maintain the same standard.
The factory worker (ac-
cording to figures of the De-
partment of Commerce) was
in 1952, excluding pension
rights and other fringe bene-
fits, 24.2% better off after al-
lowance for inflation and
higher taxes.
The farmer (according to
figures of the Department of
Agriculture) in 1952 was 73%
better off.
The person trying to live
on income from bonds was
63% worse off in 1952.
The person trying to live
on income from stocks was
42% worse off.
It would seem that in sim-
ple justice this trend should
be checked. And I believe
that if this administration
would explain this to the
people it would have their
support.
But the pseudo-seers in
Washington and in Wall
Street believe in following,
not leading the people.
