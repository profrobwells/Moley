Idaho Takes a Dim View
of U.S. Public Power
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
PORTLAND, Or. Three
days spent last week in the
State of Idaho convinced me
that the state of mind of offi-
cials of that State concerning
the Hell's Canyon controver-
sy is precisely what it was
when I first studied the is-
sue there two years ago.
The State is dead set
against the plan of the Fed-
eral government to build in
the canyon and is firmly be-
hind the substitute plan of
the Idaho Power Co. All
that has changed is the plan
of the power company. It
now proposes three rather
than five smaller dams—in
the Snake River Valley, one
within 1000 feet of the site
of the proposed Federal dam
in Hell's Canyon, another
still farther up at Brownlow.

The dam proposed by the
Truman administration, and
in behalf of which one of the
most expensive and long-
winded propaganda opera-
tions ever staged by the In-
terior Department was
waged, was to have been a
monstrous affair.
It was to have been high-
est in the United States. Its
site was to have been in one
of the most remote and in-
accessible places in the Unit-
ed States. At that point
Hell's Canyon is 7000 feet
deep, exceeding the Grand
Canyon in depth but not in
beauty. Estimates of its cost
ran higher than $500,000,000
but considering the fact that
such structures always run
far beyond estimates it
would probably have cost the
American taxpayers not far
from $1,000,000,000. That cost
would have been far greater
than Grand Coulee.
As an alternative means of
getting electric power for the
Northwest, the Idaho Power
Co. proposes the three lower
dams named above. Their
cost, of course, would be met
by private investment and
the structure and the opera-
tion resulting would yield
over $10,000,000 a year in tax
receipts to local, State and
Federal governments. Thus,
in the 50 years of theoretical
repayment from a Federal
dam the private dams would
yield $500,000,000 in revenue.
★
This would seem to be a
very good deal for the hard-
pressed taxpayers and appar-
ently the President and Sec-
retary McKay thought so, for
the Secretary withdrew the
opposition of the Interior De-
partment to the applications
of the Idaho Power Co. to the
Federal Power Commission.
The advocates of Socialized
Federal power have been ve-
hement in their protests,
however, and the junior Sen-
ator from Oregon, Wayne
Morse, has charged the Presi-
dent and the Secretary with
all sorts of uncomplimentary
things. The subject has pro-
vided Morse with themes for
hours of oratory on the Sen-
ate floor.
At the present time the ap-
plications of the Idaho Power
Co. are being heard before
the Federal Power Commis-
sion. Representing the oppos-
ing interveners is C. Girard
Davidson, who was Assistant
Secretary of the Interior
under Truman and was for
years the arch-propagandist
for the now almost forgotten
Columbia Valley Administra-
tion plan.
In a succeeding column I
shall present some of the is-
sues involved in this contro-
versy.
