GRANTS PASS, Or.-Be-
fore leaving Oregon after sev-
eral days in the State, I wish
to point out that the State's
topmost political problem is
what to do about its junior
U.S. Senator. Wayne Morse.
I hope to state the proh-
lem without expressing a
personal judgment upon his
views or his conduct. The
judgment and sentence upon
those must be pronounced by
the electorate of Oregon in
1956, when he must run for
re-election.
Moreover I refrain from
personalities concerning
Sen. Morse
Wayne Morse, much as I dis-
agree with his opinions and
the wisdom of his conduct,
for another very good rea-
son. He has been my person-
al friend for many years.
Twenty-odd years ago he
served under my tutelage at
the Columbia University Law
School.
From Columbia he went to
the Law School of the Uni-
versity of Oregon, where he
served first as a professor
and then as dean. The evi-
dence is that he was definite-
ly controversial and highly
articulate. From time to times
his extracurricular activities
turned to labor disputes and
for a time he was associated
with the Federal Labor Board
in war years. He became
well known in the State, par-
ticularly in labor circles.
In 1944 he was nominated
and elected Senator against
rather weak opposition.
*
In the Senate he aspired
to and failed to get a seat on
the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. He ascribed the frus-
tration of this ambition to
Sen. Taft. He could not agree
with Taft on the labor legis-
lation associated with the
Ohio Senator's name and, as
the years passed, he has been
more and more articulately
associated with the opposition
to the party of which he was
originally and nominally a
member.
Indeed it is not without im-
portance that he was once a
student at the University of
Wisconsin and was tremen-
dously influenced by the in-
dependence of the elder La
Follette.
The country knows the
later history. He was an ar-
dent Eisenhower man before
the 1952 convention, but in
September, after the meeting
of the Republican candidate
with Taft, Morse developed a
violent antipathy for the Gen-
eral and has since opposed
him and his works. This has
gone so far as to move Morse
to proclaim himself to be a
one-man party--the Independ-
ent Party, he puts it--and as
such he maintains in the
Senate a somewhat odd de-
tachment.
*
It is not an understatement
to say that Republicans in
Oregon are enraged at this
conduct and that most politi-
cal conversation turns to
ways and means of defeating
Morse when he runs again.
There was plenty of opposi-
tion of that sort to him when
he ran in 1950, but it was im-
possible to get a strong candi-
date to oppose him.
Shrewd politicians say that
Morse's antics as a one-man
party are not as absurd as
they seem. He is, these peo-
ple say, anticipating a situa-
tion when he is up for re-
election once more when nei-
ther major party will renomi-
nate him and that under the
law he will have to run as an
independent. He is also, they
say, gambling on the failure
or the frustration of Eisen-
hower by 1956 in which case
Morse will be able to invest
himself with the robes of a
prophet.
It is clear that if all the op-
position to Morse could be
concentrated in one opponent
and that if such an opponent
could prepare himself for the
1956 campaign by tirelessly
making himself known to the
voters Morse could be sound-
ly beaten. But there seems
to be much difficulty in find-
ing such a savior and much
trouble in making certain
that the opposition may not
be divided. In other words,
there may be too many peo-
ple running to defeat Morse.

The real root of this pre-
dicament in which the people
of Oregon find themselves is
their own folly back in the
so-called progressive days, a
generation ago, when they
destroyed party responsibili-
ty by adopting all the nos-
trums of the reformers of
that time.
Along with their neigh-
bors, California and Wash-
ington, they enacted into
election laws principles and
practices which were predi-
cated on the idea that a po-
litical party was a malignant
thing and that the way to
conduct government was to
make it easy for a person
with a capacity for great ar-
ticulation to prevail without
party support. The Morse
problem is rooted in the im-
potence of party government
in Oregon.
