Socialism has something
like the uncanny instinct of
a cat in finding ways to get
into the house through every
opening carelessly left by the
tenants.
For years Congress has in-
dicated that it has no inten-
tion to permit the Federal
government to invade the
field of State and local educa-
tion. But it has opened a
means to the same end by in-
direction. The Senate did this
in passing a bill for the Fed-
eral control of oil and other
properties on the continental
shelf beyond the limits of
State control fixed in the fam-
ous "Tidelands legislation"
passed in May.
This continental shelf legis-
lation, which went to confer-
ence in late June and has at
this writing not been sent to
the President, should be
vetoed not only because it is
ambiguous but because, in
at least the form passed by
the Senate, it may well open
the way to that Federal con-
trol of education which Ei-
senhower has expressly dis-
approved many times.
In many ways this legisla-
tion is the most remarkable
ever passed by Congress. It
deals with an indeterminate
area of sea bottom beyond the
limits of the jurisdiction of
the States confirmed by the
Tidelands Act. It asserts the
property rights of the Feder-
al government in the land at
the bottom of the sea and the
minerals and other things be-
low that bottom.
It disclaims any sovereign-
ty by the government of the
United States on the surface
of the water above such land.
That water is the high seas
and any effort to assert sov-
ereignty there would lead to
endless controversy. The fish
swimming in the water have
international status but if
they rest on the bottom they
are the guests of the United
States.
But as the Senate commit-
tee indicated in its report,
what Federal laws are appli-
cable in that strange new
territory that we annex, what
courts have jurisdiction?
Should the laws of the abut-
ting States be made applica-
ble?
These questions have a
very practical bearing for the
time may well come in the
exploitation of the minerals
in that land when thousands
of men will be working
there. The Senate bill re-
solved this by applying first
the Constitution and Federal
law to the area and then
adopting as Federal law the
protective legislation of the
abutting States such as legis-
lation dealing with industrial
accidents, fair labor stand-
ards and unemployment aid.
But the real argument came
over the disposition of the fu-
ture revenues to be derived
from this property. The sound
suggestion of Sen. Price
Daniel of Texas that such
revenue be applied to the pay-
ing off of the national debt
seems to have been lost. That
indefatigable proponent of
Federal aid to education, Sen.
Lister Hill of Alabama,
popped up with the same idea
that he vainly attempted to
substitute for the Tidelands
legislation. His proposal was
to put the revenues from the
development of oil and other
resources into a special ac-
count to be used exclusively
as grants-in-aid of primary,
secondary and higher educa-
tion.
The Hill amendment would
permit this account to be used
for defense during the pres-
ent emergency but after that
for education. It puts a limit
of three years on the emer-
gency use of the funds. This
is a silly limitation for not
even Sen. Hill can know the
course of international affairs.
But the absurdity of the
whole matter, a logical absur-
dity of course, for in terms of
selfish politics it is very prac-
tical, is that no administrative
formula or mechanism is pro-
posed to distribute the money
to the States. Nor is there any
provision to determine what
sort of education this money
is to be used for.
