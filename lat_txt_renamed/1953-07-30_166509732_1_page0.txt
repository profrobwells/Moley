Wage Statistics Should
Include Fringe Benefits
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
One government publica-
tion which is well worth
what it costs the purchaser
and the taxpayer is the July
issue of the Survey of Cur-
rent Business of the Depart-
ment of Commerce. In that
issue the department gives
full statistics on a large num-
ber of interesting and impor-
tant aspects of our national
economic life for the preced-
ing year. It has just been
made available to the public.
Nowhere is the fact so
clearly shown that the status
of the wage earner has sensa-
tionally improved over the
last few years and that to a
greater and greater degree
his real income is far above
the amount of his wages. The
so-called "fringe benefits" are
increasing at a relatively
more rapid rate than almost
any other statistic in our eco-
nomic life. Indeed, the fringe
ultimately may be a major
part of the cloth.
In 1952 the supplemental
compensation of "persons em-
ployed by others" amounted
to $9,585,000,000. This covers
payments by the employer
for Social Security, unem-
ployment compensation pay-
ments, insurance, company
pensions and other direct
benefits for the worker. Those
of us who are self-employed
should note carefully that
these items are mainly the
things which we must pro-
vide for ourselves out of our
own earnings. We should
note that by comparison
with the above figure the to-
tal of all dividends in 1952
was $9,107,000,000.
Usually, when the amount
of wages paid in this country
is given either in sum total
or in average per person, this
supplemental pay is not in-
cluded.
Another sum which also
benefits the workers is the
amount paid out by Federal,
State and local governments
for pensions, assistance, un-
employment pay and direct
relief. This, in 1952, accord-
ing to the Department of Com-
merce survey, was $12,861,-
000,000. There is, of course,
some duplication between this
figure and the one given
above for payments by em-
ployers. But a substantial
amount is paid by taxpayers
who are not also wage earn-
ers.
That this huge sum is likely
to grow with the years is
strongly indicated by some
other facts published last
week in the Congressional
Record. Carl Curtis of Ne-
braska is chairman of a sub-
committee of the House Ways
and Means Committee which
was appointed to investigate
our Social Security laws.
The magnitude of the task
of this subcommittee, as well
as the capacity of Congress-
men to seek greater benefits
for their people, is shown by
a compilation made by the
Curtis subcommittee of all
the bills introduced in six
short months by members of
the House for the amend-
ment of old age assistance
and survivors insurance leg-
islation. There are 170 of
them. Some members intro-
duced seven or eight.
Fortunately, this torrent
will not descend upon the
taxpayer all at once. In fact,
few, if any, will pass. But this
is an omen of things to come.
It is also a fine demonstra-
tion of the fact that an elec-
tion is coming next year.
