THE TRADITION OF SEN. TAFT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Robert A. Taft lost
the nomination in 1940 to
Wendell Willkie, a friend
wrote to him saying that it
was not in the Taft tradition
to find frustration in defeat.
His father had suffered the
misfortune to occupy the
Presidency at a moment when
profound social and econom-
ic change made a split in the
Republican Party inevitable.
But William H. Taft rose
above the men and circum-
stances which accomplished
his defeat to be an enlight-
ened and deeply respected
Chief Justice.

Some who have written
since the death of the son
have overstressed the useful-
ness of his service since the
convention a year ago. True,
that demonstration was mag-
nanimity and high patriotism.
But it was the natural con-
duct of the same Taft who
sought the nomination. It
was no surprise to his friends.
Like his father, the son
contemptuously rejected the
arts of the demagogue and by
the simple force of character
confounded his detractors.
The comments since his
death stress quite properly
his superb intelligence, his
indefatigable labors, his rug-
ged honesty, and his grim
courage. But these are but the
trappings and the tools of
greatness. What counts is the
use to which so fine a mind
is given, the purposes to
which such labor is devoted,
the matters in which honesty
is shown, and the capacity
to know when courage is
needed. As a friend remarked
in the Senate, Taft's constan-
cy suggested Paul's admoni-
tion, "having done all, to
stand." But there are differ-
ent ways of identifying "the
whole armor of God."
It was the lavish giving of
all these priceless qualities to
massive ideals that measured
Taft's eminence. And the fact
that those ideals were shared
by so many of his country-
men explains the passionate
that made up his criticisms
of his opposition during the
long years when he was the
most authentic voice of the
minority. His faith, like that
devotion which they gave
him.
His supreme faith was in a
system which guaranteed ev-
ery individual's political and
economic liberty and in the
moral order behind and be-
yond that constitutional sys-
tem. He saw the essential
rightness of our constitutional
order and his faith found its
way into every cause that he
espoused, every piece of legis-
lation that he helped to
frame, and every stricture
of his father, was in liberty
guarded by "the long, still
grasp of the law."
He shared the fear of in-
numerable Americans that
foreign entanglements un-
wisely entered into might
dissipate our strength and
impair our liberty at home.
This his opponents called iso-
lationism. But he lived to
know the frustration of some
of our foreign adventures
and to see the stark reality
of isolationism under the gen-
the name of neutrality become
the policy of France and oth-
er European nations. He
lived to see the irony in hav-
ing his own country come to
be known in Europe, the
Middle East and Asia as the
archinterventionist.
Taft fiercely defended two
of the indispensable agencies
of constitutionalism, the divi-
sion of power between the
President and the Congress
and the two-party system.
Early in his campaign for
the Senate in 1950 it was
made known to him that he
could have the practical cer-
tainty of success in the elec-
tion if he would make an
agreement across party lines.
He grimly rejected the sug-
gestion and chose to fight it
out with every other man on
his ticket. He realized that to
destroy party responsibility
is to invite chaos or even dic-
tatorship.

In noting the growing af-
fection and confidence be-
tween the President and
Taft it is only fair to say that
the keen mind and uncompro-
mising honesty of the Sena-
tor could not have permitted
the rapprochement had it
not been clear that they
shared a devotion to the
rights of Congress and the
two-party system. There
could be no greater assur-
ance of the President's funda-
mental ideals to those follow-
ers of Taft who must now
share the task of unifying the
party.
The finest, most generous,
and most accurate epitaph was
the statement of Herbert
and most nearly irreplaceable
man in three generations.
