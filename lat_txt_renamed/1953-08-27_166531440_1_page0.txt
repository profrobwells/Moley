SANTA BARBARA - The
death last week in Dublin of
Edward J. Flynn, for 31 years
the undisputed boss of the
immense borough of the
Bronx, was probably where
he would have ordered It to
take place. His orders were
usually law.
He had an attachment for
Dublin which surpassed most
of the other sentiments which
marked his life. His father,
who came from there and
was educated at Trinity Col-
lege, was a dignified, cultured
man who made the pursuit of
leisure a sophisticated art.
Ed Flynn resembled his fa-
ther in both respects. He
loved books and he hated
hard work. His great person-
al charm and quick mind
seemed to make serious ex-
ertion unnecessary.
In these respects he defied
the traditions of political
bossism. In fact, he differed
in so many respects from the
American stereotype of a
city politician that it is dif-
ficult to conceive of him as a
boss.
★
A boss is supposed to min-
gle freely with all sorts and
conditions of people. Acces-
sibility is supposed to be es-
sential to his power. But
Flynn was difficult to ap-
proach. He lived in regal de-
tachment. Most of his time
between elections was spent
far from the Bronx—either
in a Westchester estate, in
traveling in the United States
or in Europe.
He held his political sub-
ordinates at arm's length. He
said with complete candor:
"I intended to keep my per-
sonal life entirely separate
from my political life . . . I
have not visited the homes
of (his district leaders) nor
have they been inside mine.
I meet them only when oc-
casion requires."
But since 1922 this man
ruled the political affairs of
the Bronx with complete au-
thority. In part, this mastery
was due to a matchless sense
of thinking and of judgment
of men. He never deceived
himself by wishful thinking.
If an election was in the
offing in which his side was
in trouble, he would frankly
admit that fact to himself.
★
In 1946, when many Demo-
cratic Congressional seats
were swept by Republicans,
he told me in confidence not
only which seats would
change sides but the approxi-
mate majorities in each. I
knew in October, 1952, that
Stevenson was lost in New
York because a friend of
Flynn told me so. His po-
litical predictions were the
most accurate that I have
ever known.
Beyond his capacity to win
loyalty by the quality of his
judgment, Flynn's power
rested in two other facts.
For two decades he had com-
plete access to Federal pa-
tronage. And he prevented
any popular uprising by his
efforts to keep his govern-
ment scandal-free.
For instance, he held that
law enforcement should be
entrusted to District Attor-
neys of unquestioned hones-
ty and ability. When William
O'Dwyer forced himself into
the Mayoralty over Flynn's
doubts, the Bronx boss de-
manded and secured from the
new Mayor assurance that
officers of the city who had
large sums to handle should
be kept over from the La
Guardia reform administra-
tion.
Flynn was made leader of
the Bronx when he was 30
years old by the fabulous
Charles F. Murphy, then the
master of the party in New
York State. Flynn had entered
politics with reluctance and
never seemed to enjoy his
profession.
★
When Roosevelt was elect-
ed Governor, Flynn, again re-
luctantly, accepted the post of
Secretary of State, which
meant that he was to master-
mind the preconvention cam-
paign of the New York Gov-
ernor. Flynn claims that he
and he alone brought Farley
into that campaign. For years
—until Yalta, in fact, where
he was an unannounced guest
—he was closest to F. D. R. in
all political matters, more so
at all times than Farley.
In later years his detach-
ment became more and more
pronounced. Ill-health was
partly responsible for that,
but a disposition which al-
ways seemed a part of his na-
ture, to regard politics as a
bore and a rather incidental
concern, had its part.
His death removes the last
of the great Democratic bar-
ons in New York. Tammany,
which is New York County
as distinguished from the
Bronx, has never been the
same since Murphy. The
Bronx will probably fall into
destructive rivalries and weak
hands now.
For there can be no real
successor to Flynn.
