New York Finds the U.N.
an Overbearing Guest
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The United Nations Organ-
ization is beset with troubles,
largely of its own making.
Congress is probing into the
loyalty of some of its em-
ployees. The American peo-
ple in large numbers are won-
dering whether the whole
thing is worth what it costs.
And newspaper readers are
bored with the bellowings of
Vishinsky.
But there is another and
more immediately concerned
with this international con-
gregation—the people of the
host, New York City. The
swarming employees of the
United Nations are exercising
privileges with little concern
for the rights of the numer-
ous and patient burghers of
New York.
For years now the immense
job of construction has been
in progress on the East River
in the neighborhood of 42nd
St.
★
One street after another
has been either shut off or
pushed over or clogged with
construction. Meanwhile, the
problem of transportation
has grown. For the unfor-
tunates like this writer, who
lives uptown and works on
42nd St., communication by
private automobile became
impossible long ago. The dif-
ficulties of midtown parking
are well-nigh insuperable ex-
cept for a few minutes here
and there. My own trans-
portation problem involves
either a long walk and two
subways, or three different
busses, or a half-hour’s taxi
ride.
But U.N. employees, wher-
ever they live, enjoy marvel-
ous immunity. Hundreds of
cars accumulate with the
magic letters UN printed on
the license plates. Long
stretches of streets in the
busy section of midtown are
literally lined with the cars
of these international work-
ers.
But in the course of the
construction, the city and the
United Nations had agreed to
the inclusion in the buildings
of subsurface garage space
for 1500 cars. This was con-
structed, but instead of using
it all for the parking for
which it was intended, the
United Nations has used
space for 250 cars as room for
storage.
After polite suggestions
from the city that the garage
space be used to relieve the
street parking of U.N. em-
ployees were ignored, the
temper of Robert Moses rose
to the boiling point.
Moses is not only Park
Commissioner but the official
liaison between the city and
the United Nations. He wrote
a scorching letter to Secre-
tary General Dag Hammar-
skjold. The use of the garage
for storage, Moses pointed
out, was in violation of the
original agreement under
which the city has spent
$23,000,000 to improve high-
way approaches and to widen
the streets around the U.N.
plant, the ground for which
was provided by a citizen of
New York, John D. Rocke-
feller. Moses went on to say
that the use of garage space
for storage was not only “sil-
ly” administration but “a
rather poor way of repaying
those who have been your
friends.”
Up to now, Moses contin-
ued, he had been a friend and
supporter of the United Na-
tions, but one of his difficul-
ties at the present time is to
persuade the public that the
“United Nations is not an ar-
bitrary, extraterritorial in-
stitution which pays no at-
tention to the rules and prac-
tices of the government mu-
nicipality in which it is locat-
ed.”

But the Moses blast only
produced this amazing reply
from the Secretary General:
“We need it—and will al-
ways need it—and under no
circumstances do I feel that
we would be justified in going
outside our own buildings
and rent space merely to al-
low the conversion of the
area to additional parking
space.”
“Our own buildings” were
in large part built with the
money of American taxpay-
ers, the ground beneath was
given by John D. Rockefel-
ler, and the streets leading to
the immense monument
were built by the city of
New York. The streets in
which U.N. employees enjoy
free parking were built by
the city. And the taxpayer of
the city must find his own
means of getting to work.
This is the United Nations
that was to bring peace and
goodwill among men.
