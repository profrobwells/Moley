HEART OF
SOCIALISM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The late Harold J. Laski—
whose commitment to Marx-
ism was so extreme that even
the Attlee government found
him a liability—had a habit
during his many trips to
the United States of telling
pop-eyed academic audiences
what should be done about
America. The essential theme
was always Socialism.

In one of his discussions he
stressed the importance of
Federal grants-in-aid to the
States. These, he concluded,
are fundamental to the idea
of a "national minimum."
That, I believe, is a piece of
jargon meaning the extent to
which the central government
should take over. The "na-
tional minimum," Laski said,
"lies at the heart of Socialism."

This point of view toward
Federal expansion runs
through all Socialist propaganda.
For to make Socialism
effective, it must be at the
national level. And the most
certain way to eliminate the
States is to bribe them with
Federal grants, the money for
which is raised by stealing
the tax sources of the States.
A nation of kept States must
be the necessary prelude to a
nation of kept citizens.

The extent to which the
States in the last few years
have been reduced to the
"kept" status is shown by the
growth of grants-in-aid. In
Theodore Roosevelt's first
term the Federal government
gave only $3,000,000 to the
States. In 1912 this had risen
to $5,255,000.

Then came the Federal in-
come tax, innocently con-
trived by both Democrats
and Republicans, but with the
malignant power within its
limitless reach to destroy all
private property. Grants-in-
aid proliferated. In 1920 they
were $33,188,000. After 1933
the march really got under
way. In 1941 grants-in-aid
were $536,682,000. And in 1951
they were $2,280,000,000.

Those grants per capita
show a tremendous variation
among States. They ranged
in 1951 from $7.03 per capita
in New Jersey to $18.99 in
Wyoming. Social welfare
grants have become the greatest
purpose of these expenditures.

A few of these grants are
for purposes for which the
Federal government should
bear the primary responsibility,
such as care and assistance
for veterans. There
are also some things, such as
conservation of natural resources,
highways, and agriculture,
that are joint Federal-
state responsibilities. But
three-fourths of the money
spent in these grants is for
purposes for which the States
should have responsibility.
And the States must beg for
this aid because the Federal
government has invaded the
tax sources from which the
States ought to get the money
to help themselves.

Candidate Eisenhower made
a point, over and over, in his
1952 campaign that these
functions, together with the
tax sources to support them
should go back to the States.
In fact, this is a cardinal principle
in his philosophy. Eisenhower
is more firm in his determination
to accomplish
this restoration than was Sen.
Taft, who, it should be remembered,
was sponsor for
projects for aid to education
and housing.

Pursuant to his promise,
the President secured from
Congress authorization for a
commission to make a comprehensive
study of the subject.
As chairman of that
commission, the President has
Clarence Manion, former dean
of the Law School of Notre
Dame University.

Manion's position toward
Federal supergovernment has
been made very clear in many
speeches and articles. He
firmly believes that the wide
highway to Socialism is
through the progressive encroachment
by the Federal
government upon the resources
and responsibilities
of the States. He can be
counted on to be as aggressive
in this field as Herbert
Hoover will be in the wider
field to which he has been
assigned.

Together—for in many
ways their lines will cross in
these twin investigations—
they should constitute a good
team to pull back the Federal
government from the areas
which it has occupied in these
last four decades.
