U.S. MYTHS
IN BRITAIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No amount of diplomacy or
loans or gifts will avail so
long as influential British pa-
pers continue to publish dis-
torted views about American
political life.
A year ago, I repeatedly
commented on the false im-
pressions sent overseas con-
cerning, first, the Taft-Ei-
senhower contest for the
nomination and, later, the
Stevenson-Eisenhower cam-
paign for the Presidency.
After the election I wrote
an article for the Freeman
in which I gave chapter and
verse to substantiate my
charge. The publications
which I singled out for criti-
cism were the highly influ-
ential London Times, Man-
chester Guardian, and the
weekly Economist. I found
nothing in the London Daily
Telegram to criticize. In fact,
that newspaper shows clearly
that British can have the
truth if they get accurate, in-
formed and unbiased report-
ing.
To illustrate what I mean
by distorted reporting, I use
as a random but characteris-
tic sample the American Sur-
vey and American Notes in
the issue of the Economist
for Sept. 19.
First, there is an article
date-lined Washington about
the Durkin resignation. It
takes precisely the position
that Durkin himself and his
partisan labor and Democrat-
ic friends would take. Here
is a sample:
"In fact, the labor program
worked out by Mr. Durkin
and the White House, which
caused such alarm in the
right wing of the Republican
Party, was not the surrender
to the trade unions which the
frightened conservatives
imagined. Many of the
changes in the Taft-Hartley
Act suggested in the 'lost
message' of July 31 had been
approved by the late Sen.
Taft."
True, some changes had
been approved by Taft, but
the ones which he probably
never heard about were what
made the difference between
a mild revision and a sell-
out to the labor leaders.
Then the Economist goes on
with a dispatch from an un-
named "correspondent in San
Francisco" about California
politics. This correspondent
is an orthodox follower of the
internationalist line. First
there is a discussion of War-
ren's virtues as Governor.
Then there is mention of the
"Warren-hating, isolationist
supporters of Lt. Gov. Good-
win Knight, who include
leading lights of the Cali-
fornia Medical Association
and important oil interests."
That is selectivity with a
vengeance.
Finally the article gets
around to a vehement attack
on Sen. Knowland in which
by a devious indirection it is
suggested that Warren is
opposed to Knowland's inter-
nationalist views. This is
"proved" by the assertion that
"Mr. Warren has never en-
dorsed any of Mr. Knowland's
extreme views."
True, but so far as I know
Warren has never endorsed
anybody's views on foreign
affairs beyond uttering of a
few generalities with which
no one could disagree.
There is also, in an Ameri-
can Note, a return to the
American hero of the Econo-
mist, Adlai Stevenson. He
passed, in Chicago "with fly-
ing colors the first test."
