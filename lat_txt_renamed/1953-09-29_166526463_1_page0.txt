PAYING AS WE OWE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Many people have pointed
out the fallacy in the Social
Security trust funds and the
wisdom of adopting a pay-as-
you-owe policy. But never
has the case been so con-
vincingly made as in a re-
cent article in the New York
Journal of Commerce by Dr.
Julius Hirsch.
Hirsch is an economist who
once held high office in the
pre-Hitler Bruening govern-
ment in Germany. He has
lived here since 1940 and has
done noteworthy work as an
economic consultant.
His proposal, if adopted,
would at one stroke redeem
the national debt from $272,-
600,000,000 to $235,000,000,000.
This would eliminate the
whole question of raising the
debt ceiling of $275,000,000,-
000, now established by act of
Congress.
The trust funds involved
are these: old age and survi-
vors' insurance, $10,000,000,-
000; Civil Service retirement
and disability, $5,700,000,000;
railroad retirement, $3,300,
000,000, and unemployment,
$9,800,000,000.
These funds, from the
standpoint of the agency that
must pay obligations for
them—and that is the govern-
ment—are not in the savings
bank, like an individual's
money. They cannot be spent,
because they are not money.
They are debts. Before a dol-
lar is paid to a beneficiary, a
bond must be paid off from
tax money. In short, that
dollar must be secured not
from the trust fund but from
some outside source.
*
The analogy of a govern-
ment trust fund and an in-
surance company asset is
false. An insurance asset is a
thing of value. A government
bond held by the government
is an obligation, a minus
quantity.
The dollar you paid for So-
cial Security last year is not
in Uncle Sam's till in safe-
keeping for you. It has been
spent for guns or to feed a
family in Pakistan or to keep
a military attache in the
Paris Embassy well clad for
tomorrow's cocktail party.
When you call for it at the
age of 65, the government will
have to get it from a lot of
somebodies through taxes,
and you will be one of the
somebodies.
The Hirsch suggestion
would wipe out all this non-
sense and make the system
pay as it owes.
All that the trust fund rep-
resents to you is a promise to
pay. That promise to pay
would be just as valid if it
were made directly by act of
Congress and if the money
were paid out of current in-
come. It would be explicit,
while the present obligation
is implicit in the trust fund.
Of course, this change
would not create money to
run the government. Just as
much would be needed as be-
fore, and it would have to
be raised by some sort of
taxation.
But this change would
eliminate the rigmarole of
indirection now existing and
serve notice on everyone that
they are paying and tell
them what they are paying
for.
Whether individuals should
still make contributions
should be decided on the ba-
sis of broad principle. Should
people be compelled by gov-
ernment to save? Maybe so.
Maybe not. I am inclined to-
ward the side of liberty. Peo-
ple should be induced to save,
not forced by the power of
the state.
