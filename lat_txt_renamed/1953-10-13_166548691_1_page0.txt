Two tinpot Machiavellians,
both professing the new "lib-
eralism," have recently ex-
pressed views of political ex-
pediency which recall those
times 400 years ago when a
Florentine with no illusions
wrote of the decadent politics
of his age. Perhaps they show
how durable have been the
political practices which
Machiavelli recommended to
the contemporary Medici.
My first example is the
Hon. Hubert Humphrey, Sen-
ator from Minnesota and big
shot in the Americans for
Democratic Action. In the cur-
rent Newsweek magazine he
tells Correspondent Samuel
Shaffer of his strategy for his
campaign for re-election in
1954. Humphrey recognizes,
writes Shaffer, that President
Eisenhower "is even more
popular today" than he was
last November. Hence, he will
avoid making a direct assault.
"The Senator's tactic," con-
tinues Shaffer, "has been to
snipe at the administration's
flanks."
At a Democratic dinner the
Senator said: "Hubert Hum-
phrey is . holding up Ike
so that the Republicans won't
drag him in the mud." In
short, he will try to ride with
Ike for a while. Shaffer writes:
"If the President retains his
popularity, Humphrey will re-
frain from attacking him.
"There won't be any need for
it,' he explains."
What Humphrey really
means is that it won't be
healthy for him to oppose the
President as long as the President is popular.
"However," Shaffer adds,
"if Mr. Eisenhower slips,
then Humphrey will tear
right into him."
My second example is
Adolf Berle Jr., long a
member of the Roosevelt ad-
ministration and for a while
Ambassador to Brazil. Long
ago, when he was a member
of the so-called brain trust,
he commented that he was
absorbing political education
by reading Machiavelli's
"Prince" once a year. That
education now serves him
well, for he has ascended to
the chairmanship of Dave
Dubinsky's Liberal Party in
New York.
The Liberal candidate for
Mayor of New York is Ru-
dolph Halley. As a member
of the Board of Estimate it
became his responsibility to
vote for a transit authority
whose duty would be to raise
subway fares to save the city
from bankruptcy. Since the
people of New York have
been hoodwinked into believing that they could have low
fares and high service, it was
an unpleasant political duty
to vote for honest fares.
Facing this bitter choice,
Halley seems to have talked
things over with Berle, his
Liberal friend and mentor. So,
according to Berle, this is
what happened:
"I talked it over with him,
and we agreed that if his vote
was needed, if it was that or
having the whole thing go into a tailspin, he'd vote for it,
but that he wouldn't vote for
it unless he had to. What he
was saying is that that is a
bad job, and as his vote
wasn't needed to pass it, he
could afford to vote against it
and did."
And so Halley voted against
the bitter pill which his more
responsible and conscientious
colleagues passed in the face
of political peril.
Sincerity, responsibil-
ity and courage seem to me
not only to have a close relationship in politics but are
parts of the same whole. All
three are apparently lacking
in these professing reformers.
The pity is that both have
been professors in fact. Humphrey before entering politics
taught political science. Berle
was and is a professor in the
Columbia Law School. They
should know better. Or, shall
I say, perhaps they know too
much.
