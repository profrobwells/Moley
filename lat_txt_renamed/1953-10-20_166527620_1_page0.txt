There is a disposition
among "Eisenhower-before-
Chicago" people to ascribe
the defeat of the Republican
Padrutt by the Democrat
Johnson in the 9th Wisconsin
District to all sorts of factors
except displeasure with Presi-
dent Eisenhower. A good ex-
ample of that sort of ration-
alization is in an editorial
comment in the New York
Herald Tribune:
"To put the matter bluntly,
the President is more popu-
lar than his party. The need
is to impart something of his
appeal to those who run on
the Republican ticket... The
answer to the problem is not
merely lip service to the ideal
of liberal Republicanism rep-
resented by Mr. Eisenhower.
The answer must be a record
of accomplishment by the
party as a whole, for which
Congress is considered no
less responsible than the
President."
This is written with all of
that delightful, long-distance
detachment from facts im-
parted by the seclusion of an
office in New York. The writ-
er might have learned how
silly he was by a few long-
distance calls.
*
One such call I made to a
man who has campaigned in
the 9th Wisconsin many
times. His opinion was that
Hull, the previous holder of
the seat, had over the years
done just as well without
Eisenhower as with him. He
said, further, that the great
majority of the people of the
9th are by tradition and sym-
pathy still La Follette pro-
gressives; that they broke
over party lines this time to
take a former progressive
who opposed the Eisenhower
policies and to reject a for-
mer progressive who zealous-
ly promised to support Eisen-
hower all along the line.
My friend said also that
the people of the 9th, being
progressives, are unhappy
over the influence of "big
business" in the Eisenhower
administration; that they do
not think Dulles is much of
an improvement over Ache-
son; that they believe Secre-
tary Benson is wholly out of
touch with farm problems in
the Middle West.
Another source of informa-
tion tells me that the voters
in the 9th are not at all happy
about Sen. Wiley's opposition
to the Bricker amendment
and about the appointment of
Warren, who is known in
Wisconsin because he cam-
paigned there in the primary
fight in 1952.

I offer these opinions with
no guarantee of their ac-
curacy, but merely to show
that informed people are not
deluding themselves with the
idea that the popularity of
Eisenhower is wholly unim-
paired.
In addition to these opin-
ions—and they are mostly
opinions—a few facts can be
adduced to controvert the
coattails theory. In 1952,
with Eisenhower running,
with him, Merlin Hull, the
Republican candidate, re-
ceived a smaller percentage
of the total vote than he did
in 1950. In 1948 and 1946 he
had no Democratic opponent
at all. In 1944 he ran as a
Progressive without opposi-
tion, and in 1942 he was elect-
ed as a Progressive.
Hull's voting record was
decidedly against most of the
Eisenhower-Dulles foreign
policies. But Johnson, the
successful candidate, declared
that he would follow the Hull
pattern of policy. The unsuc-
cessful Republican, as I indi-
cated above, was for the
Eisenhower policies.
Altogether, this result is a
portent which the President
as well as the Republican
Party should note. It was a
vote not only against law
but the administration of law.
