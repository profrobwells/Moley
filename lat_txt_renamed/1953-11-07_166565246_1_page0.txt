What the GOP Needs
Is an Active Spokesman
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I have a letter on the re-
cent cattle hullabaloo from a
friend in California whose
perception has been sharp-
ened rather than dulled by
confinement in his home with
a long and serious illness. An
eye complication limits his
reading but seems to tone up
his thinking.
He has laid his finger on
precisely the spot where the
Eisenhower administration is
weakest.
What my friend writes is
that the General of the Army
and his associate generals
now running the government
of the United States do not
seem to know how to counter-
attack in political warfare.
His letter goes on to say:
"Take, for example, the 350
'cattlemen' who just conduct-
ed a bonus march on Wash-
ington. It would be interest-
ing to know how many of
the alleged 'cattlemen' were
actually in the cattle business
five years ago or 10 years ago
or, in fact, even now.
What the administration
needs is—I called it a 'pub-
licity department,' but I
guess I mean a spokesman.
There is a pretty good one in
Congress, down at the street-
fighting level, in Sen. McCar-
thy.
"There is need for some-
one of such controversial
power in the administration,
at the front porch or even the
power level. It needs some-
one who can respond appro-
priately to a pious, platitudi-
nous Kefauver without get-
ting the President into a
backstairs brawl.
"There didn't seem to be
anyone who would point out
that those 'cattlemen' were
strictly synthetic. There was
plenty of sound logic behind
Benson, but nobody brought
it out in a way that the mass
of people could understand
... for want of a competent
spokesman the Republicans
are about to lose the battle
without getting their guns
loaded."
Here and there items have
appeared in the press that,
taken together, could have
destroyed the whole effect of
the caravan. One item said
that a leader was not a cattle-
man at all, that he grew spin-
ach. Another was that one
member of the caravan was
actually a cattleman and that
while he was in Washington
crying out about bankruptcy
50 head of his yearling steers
were sold in Sioux City for
$21 per 100 pounds. The 100%
parity figure on Oct. 15 was
$20.80.
In a situation like this, the
administration has all the
facts and plenty of people to
collect and organize them in
a counterattack. It was a
matter of common knowl-
edge that the "team" that
worked for Patton of the
Farmers' Union was Bran-
nan, Baker, and Geissler of
the Truman Department of
Agriculture, and that one Mo-
Cune, formerly of that de-
partment, was working on
publicity for the Democratic
National Committee.
As his letter indicates, my
friend is not thinking of a
demagogic "hatchetman" to
answer for the administra-
tion. Neither am I. But in ev-
ery effective administrative
setup there were articulate—
sometimes fiercely articulate—
people to speak up, give
facts and figures, and name
names.
Can anyone imagine Henry
Wallace when Secretary of
Agriculture remaining silent
or turning the other cheek in
the face of such an attack?
We may have strongly disap-
proved of the reckless way in
which Harold Ickes spoke for
the Roosevelt administration.
But he was articulate, and he
knew that these matters are
struggles for political exist-
ence and cannot be settled by
soft talk.
The President does not an-
swer such attacks. But some-
one under his general direc-
tion should. And the answer
should not wait too long aft-
er the attack.
