Some Americans, overexer-
cised about the unpopularity
of Uncle Sam in Britain, are
disposed to place all the
blame on our Congressional
Investigating committees. It
might be better if-they would
suggest to their British
friends that some of their
newspapers get some more
accurate and unbiased report-
ers over here.
From time to time I have
commented in these articles
on the bias in the reporting
of news from the United
States, particularly in the
London Times, the Manches-
ter Guardian and the week-
ly Economist. I offer today
some specimens from the
Times reports on the White
caseâ€”from the Brownell
speech in Chicago to and in-
cluding Nov. 20. These are
cited to show (a) bias, (b)
ignorance, (c) both.
"Our Own Correspondent,"
in his London Times dis-
patch on the President's Ar-
mistice Day press conference,
said:
"The FBI is said to have
had 500 agents at work on
the case from then (Febru-
ary, 1946) until the spring of
1947, by which time they had
found nothing new and had
only the unsupported word
of Miss Bentley."
This was not reporting. It
was reckless surmise hidden
behind that refuge of all gos-
sips, "it is said." According
to J. Edgar Hoover, the origi-
nal warning in 1946 was based
upon 30 sources.
"Our Own Correspondent"
then says: "The hunt was
called off," a statement for
which he could have had no
credible evidence. Even Tru-
man admitted that the "hunt"
went on.
In his dispatch dated Nov.
15 the correspondent said that
Vinson and Clark, after get-
ting the advice of Hoover,
suggested that White be left
as executive director (for the
United States) "where he
could do little harm." Hoover
made no such recommenda-
tion. A spy in that position
could do incalculable harm
because he would have com-
plete information concerning
the currencies and finances
of many countries.
Of course, McCarthy is
dragged in to note that the
Senator's "dramatic spy hunt
at Ft. Monmouth seems to
have fizzled out." The extent
to which it had fizzled out
will be demonstrated, per-
haps, before this article ap-
pears in print.
On Nov. 20 "Our Own Cor-
respondent" reports in con-
nection with the request for
an opportunity to interview
Gouzenko: "It is thought that
public opinion in Canada
would not soon forgive its
government for doing any-
thing to help one of these
investigating committees."
Here hidden again behind a
gossip's formula, "it is
thought," is a flat statement
by the correspondent that
our friendly neighbor is un-
willing to co-operate with the
Congress of the United
States.
Incidentally, "Our Own
Correspondent" reported in
the Times last spring that
the Jowitt book on the Hiss
case had been withdrawn by
the publishers under pres-
sure exerted by the "long
arm" of Sen. McCarthy and
his colleagues. The fact was
that McCarthy never had
heard of the book. Nora de
Toledano, whose husband
Ralph wrote the book "Seeds
of Treason" on the Hiss case,
wrote to the publishers when
the book was sent to review-
ers, pointing out 100 errors.
She was thanked by the pub-
lishers and the book was
thereupon withdrawn.
As a final flourish, the
Times published a bitterly
partisan leading editorial.
Two statements in that edi-
torial show how utterly that
once great paper's editorial
writers seem to misunder-
stand the elements of Amer-
ican government and prac-
tice.
The editorial says that
after White had been con-
firmed "it would have been
practically impossible to take
any action other than that
which Mr. Truman did take."
This is not true. The Presi-
dent could have refused to
issue a commission, and it
goes beyond comprehension
that White would have re-
sorted to the courts for a
writ of mandamus, as did
Marbury in his famous case
against Madison.
Truman could have called
in White and demanded his
resignation. Or he could have
fired him.
A second statement makes
one wonder whether the
Times editor really knows
the elements of Anglo-Ameri-
can jurisprudence. He says
that the evidence against
White was "not conclusive,
as its later failure before a
grand jury showed." Are we
to believe that the Times
holds that anyone who can
escape indictment was quali-
fied to serve in the Truman
administration?
In R. F. Harrod's monu-
mental and adulatory biog-
raphy of the late Lord
Keynes, published in 1951,
there is this comment, among
many others on White: "He
was a very remarkable fig-
ure who should be accorded
an honorable place in Brit-
ish annals."
The Times reporters and
editors must have taken that
suggestion seriously.
