ELECTION
SOLUTION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Once more, in the Congress-
ional session that lies ahead,
we shall witness the sharp
ideological divergence that
lies between the President
and Congress.
The President will pro-
pose; Congress will dispose.
And all the conferences at
the White House by Republi-
can and Democratic Con-
gressional leaders will not
alter that condition.
Why, one might ask, should
there be this difference? The
same people elect the Presi-
dent and Congress. The same
party labels are attached to
both.
One explanation is the
great difference in the mode
of nomination and election.
Members of the House are
elected in 435 Congressional
districts.
Senators are elected on a
State-wide level, but they are
in not more than half of the
cases elected at the same
time at which Presidential
electors are chosen. And
their campaigns must of ne-
cessity be directed at the is-
sues, and preferences of their
own particular States.
Presidents are elected by
electors chosen at the State
level. And the candidate
whose electors get the most
votes gets all the electors of
the State. It is true that to a
degree the people who nomi-
nate a Presidential candi-
date are selected at the
level of the Congressional
district. But Presidential pri-
maries have profoundly af-
fected the plan of district
representation, and the unit
rule, so far as it prevails,
negates the plan of district
representation.
To a greater extent than
any other President, Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt grasped that
difference. Beginning after
the election of 1934 he
played for State-wide major-
ities by an appeal to the
blocs and minorities resident
in the big urban centers.
Progressively after 1936 he
carried fewer and fewer coun-
ties in the big industrial
States and still piled up a
majority from the cities.
The trend in the elections
of Presidents is toward more
democracy and away from
Republicanism. The House
has always been built in the
image of a republic. That is
as the makers of the Con-
stitution decreed. Congress
remained in the Republican
pattern. The Presidency
broke away. In fact, there
are some deluded people who
would elect the President by
a straight popular vote over
the nation. That would be
"democracy" with a ven-
geance. It would also destroy
the two-party system and put
us at the mercy of minorities.
Rep. Frederic R. Coudert
Jr. calls the present method
of nominating and electing
a President the control of "a
hidden third party" in the
"narrow constituency of the
Presidency, composed of
pressure groups and splinter
political parties."
In New York State, where
there are two splinter parties
and a number of self-con-
scious minority groups. Pres-
idential candidates of both
parties must play mostly to
these minorities for they con-
stitute the balance of power.
The 10 to 20% take prece-
dence in the solicitation over
the 80 to 90%. Other States,
where labor groups are
strong, face the same peril
of minority rule.
Coudert's remedy is a pro-
posed constitutional amend-
ment which bears his name.
It would provide for the elec-
tion of the President by 435
electors chosen at the dis-
trict level and two electors
in each State chosen at the
State-wide level. That would
make the constituency elect-
ing the President identical
with that which chooses Con-
gress.
This would bring the Presi-
dency back into the pattern
of a republic. For to seek
democracy directly is to lose
the very essence of democ-
racy to strategic minorities.
