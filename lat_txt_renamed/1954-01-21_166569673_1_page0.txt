A JONAH GOES OVERBOARD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Ever since the Americans
for Democratic Action "assist-
ed" at the tragic disaster that
befell Adlai Stevenson in
1952, traditional Democrats
have been growling in pri-
vate about the group. They
regard that lot of doubtful
allies much as the mariners
regarded Jonah. They have
been saying, as did those
frightened sailors:
"What is thine occupation?
Whence cometh thou? What
is thy country? And of what
people art thou?"
Perhaps the Lord will not
prepare a great fish to rescue
the ADA, but it is pretty cer-
tain that it will be heaved
overboard. For the mutter-
ings have now become aud-
ible, and the Democratic na-
tional chairman has ex-
pressed public doubts about
the value of Adlai's late at-
tendants.
*
The radical program of the
ADA, especially its views on
Federal civil rights legisla-
tion, has thoroughly incensed
southern Democrats. North-
ern Democrats realize that
they cannot win without the
South, and they learned in
1952 that there were issues
more dear to Southerners
than even the name Demo-
crat.
But the unpopularity of the
ADA is rooted in something
even more serious than fear
of radicalism. Americans sim-
ply do not like people who
call themselves "intellectu-
als." It smacks of snobbish-
ness. It assumes that college
degrees and professorships
are necessarily marks of a su-
perior intelligence and au-
thority. It reeks of eliteism.
And the ADA has from the
beginning been heavily load-
ed with professors.
An answer may be made by
some of the brethren who will
not agree with this that the
professors in the original
Roosevelt brain trust were
useful and permanent parts
of his administration. I can
with some right answer that
in two ways. Those profes-
sors 20 years ago were asso-
ciated in a great victory, not
a great defeat. Even then,
when the name brain trust
was applied, those of us who
were directly involved felt
the cold, clammy kiss of
death.
Four years ago I was present
at a meeting of a group of
conservative people who had
under consideration the crea-
tion of a group which might
counteract the influence of
the ADA. Those who favored
such a formal group called
their idea a "right-wing
ADA."
The consensus of that meet-
ing was that the creation of
such a formal group with a
name and an office and pe-
riodical statements of prin-
ciple would do more harm
than good to the Republican
Party. It would become a
target for the opposition to
shoot at, just as was the Lib-
erty League 18 years ago.
The members of the group
decided to work independent-
ly in any way they could,
within or without the Repub-
lican Party. In the South they
helped the more conservative
of two Democrats. In the
North they generally helped
Republican candidates for
Congress.
*
The conservative swing in
the primaries and elections of
1950 was not necessarily the
result of their labor. But
they helped, and they brought
no embarrassment to the peo-
ple whom they supported.
Moreover, the egregious gall
of some of the members of
the ADA has not helped the
Democratic cause. Consider
how this would be received
by a lifelong Democrat. It
is a statement by Prof. Ar-
thur Schlesinger Jr.:
"For a generation, of course,
the Republicans have more
or less controlled the private
communications of this coun-
try . . . but their control has
never been total. It has been
limited and offset by the fact
that liberals (not the Demo-
cratic Party) controlled the
Government..."
And so farewell to the ADA,
and better judgment next
time.
