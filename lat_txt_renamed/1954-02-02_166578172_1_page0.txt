President Eisenhower's re-
sentment at the charge that
his program is merely more
of the same that we have had
for 20 years is justified. For
in most aspects of his admin-
istration and in his proposals
in the budget and in the sepa-
rate messages there is a per-
ceptive change of direction,
and that change is vital.
The President's little play
on words to the effect that
he is liberal in human rela-
tionships and conservative in
economic affairs means noth-
ing. For every raid on the
Treasury in the last 20 years
has been in the sweet name
of humanity. And a raid on
the Treasury is an economic
matter of importance.

The brightest spot in Ei-
senhower's budget was the
reflection of his determina-
tion to halt the trend toward
Federal Socialism in the field
of electric power and in the
Federal exploitation of natu-
ral resources.
In this the President is fol-
lowing the leadership of his
wise Secretary of the In-
terior and also his own per-
sonal knowledge of the spend-
ing proclivities of the Army
Corps of Engineers.
The Bureau of Reclama-
tion, which under previous
administrations was a mighty
force for Socialization, is rap-
idly being cut down to ra-
tional limits. Expenditures in
this bureau in 1953 were $235,-
000,000; for 1954, an estimated
$182,000,000 and for 1955,
$167,000,000. For the Army
Engineers the figures for the
three years were $579,000,000;
$416,000,000; and $361,000,000.
The President's attitude to-
ward Federal aid for high-
ways, however, has failed to
follow his belief in returning
responsibilities to the States.
The figures for the three
years were $550,000,000, $592,-
000,000 and $582,000,000, how-
ever, later there may be as a
result of the recommenda-
tions of the President's Com-
mission on Intergovernmental
Relations a proposition be-
fore Congress to return the
gasoline tax to the States and
to let them build their own
highways.
There is little comfort for
those who long for economy
in the recommendations for
foreign aid. The figures show
little decision to taper off.
Meanwhile, the cost of
Social Security is rising. The
health program is generally
conservative, with the ex-
ception of a guarantee of
private health insurance. No
one seems fully to under-
stand this proposal, and it
will not become clear until
the committees of Congress
have examined the idea.
At this stage it looks as if
such a guarantee would mere-
ly permit private organiza-
tions to offer broader, cheap-
er and perhaps less pruden-
tial coverage.
A wiser suggestion would
be that insurance for medi-
cal and hospital expenses
have an exemption of, say,
$50 to $100 on the same prin-
ciple that automobile in-
surance now has a $50 exemp-
tion. Such an exemption
would permit coverage for
genuine and critical emer-
gencies and eliminate the
bookkeeping and other over-
head involved in covering
small medical and hospital
bills.

The President's tax pro-
posals in general are designed
to encourage private indus-
try.
Eisenhower, to use the
Shakespearean phrase, has
"scotched the snake of Social-
ism but not killed it." Perhaps
it is too much to expect the
killing of such a hardy crea-
ture in so short a time. We
may content ourselves, how-
ever, with the reflection that
creeping Socialism is creep-
ing more slowly.
