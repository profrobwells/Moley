NEW ORLEANS-Good
government seems to be a
habit in this city. It was cer-
tainly not always so. For a
few years ago this municipali-
ty was in the hands of as
sorry a flock of incompetents
and doubtful characters as
any city in the country has
ever failed to boast about.
*
That crowd operated on a
fairly dark background of
State government, for the
Huey Long machine was
dominant. Suddenly, and ap-
parently with few premoni-
tory symptoms, the city in
1946 aroused itself. It voted
into office a remarkably at-
tractive but quite inexperi-
enced young man, deLes-
seps Morrison-now known
far and wide as Chep.
I well remember a visit to
the city shortly after the
miracle. People were rubbing
their eyes at their sudden dis-
covery of virtue. And I sus-
pect that not the least sur-
prised man in the city was
young Chep himself.
Of course, the old-timers in
politics offered the cynical
remark that this was just one
of those things in politics.
They said that after this bath
the old grime would accumu-
late and that Chep would go
the way of most reformers
in the past. The old machine
lies down and, as the old bal-
lad has it, "bleeds a while"
and then gets up and fights
again.
Morrison seemed to be ter-
ribly in earnest and anxious
to fulfill what seemed to be
impossible expectations. But
how, reasoned the political
cognoscenti, could such an
untrained person avoid the
innumerable pitfalls that
were lying in wait in a city
which was large, cosmopoli-
tan and distinguished for
somewhat unpuritanical ro-
mance?
But the wiseacres were un-
aware of two things. One was
that, despite the love of New
Orleans for play, its people
were much like the people of
any other American city.
They had a keen pride in
their city, and after a good
draught of virtuous govern-
ment they decided it was good
for their pride as well as their
purses.

The other surprise was in
the capacity that lay be-
neath the surface of Chep
Morrison. He realized almost
at once a somber fact that so
many reformers miss-that
one-man shows in politics
play to short runs. In the
long run it is organization
that counts. And so Chep
took out insurance against
the cooling off of an aroused
electorate by building up a
strong, clean, and worldly-
wise organization known as
the Crescent City Democrat-
ic Association.
He did this with delibera-
tion and skill which had dis-
tinguished him as a youthful
colonel in the second world
war. As one of his assistants
put it, "Chep does things in
a military style. He frequent-
ly uses terms such as 'chain
of command,' 'standard oper-
ating procedure,' and 'com-
pleted staff action.'"
Morrison dwells on easy
terms with his ward and pre-
cinct leaders and has the as-
surance of their loyalty. His
leaders in the CCDA have
been of high caliber and his
appointments in the city ad-
ministration have been excel-
lent.
In 1950, at the age of 38,
Morrison was re-elected by
the largest majority in the
city's history. In the present
election, his third, he had
nine opponents but received
a big majority over all. In all
three elections his manager
has been Scott Wilson, who
conducts a public relations
firm. Morrison's contacts
with the press and the public
are looked after by a shrewd
manager of opinion, Dave
McGuire.

It is quite understandable
that much speculation should
be abroad concerning Morri-
son's future. No doubt it can
be bright if he chooses to con-
tinue in public life.
There are suggestions about
his contesting Russell Long's
seat in the U.S. Senate and
about his availability for the
Vice-Presidential nomination
in 1956. A Governorship is
also a possibility.
There are spots in the busi-
ness world where his unusual
talents might find rich re-
wards. But whatever his fu-
ture may be, he has already
established the unusual polit-
ical phenomenon of a reform-
er who is also capable of cre-
ating an organization.
