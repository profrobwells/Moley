PATERNAL
HOUSING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It was rather surprising, in
view of the President's often-
expressed dislike for Social-
ism in all forms and, what is
more important, because he
is engaged in a desperate
struggle to cut the cost of
government and lower taxes,
that his proposals for hous-
ing should involve further
debt and more paternalism.
★
One explanation of this
inconsistency may be the
President's experience at
Columbia University. That in-
stitution for more than half a
century has been located on
the east side of the Hudson
River, in a region called
Morningside Heights. Its
trustees for many years have
been charged with lack of
foresight because they failed
signally to acquire sufficient
acreage not only for expan-
sion of the institution itself
but for adequate protection
against the growth of slum
areas cheek by jowl with
ivied halls.
The result is that two of
the minority groups to which
the President referred in his
message, Negroes from Har-
lem and immigrants from
Puerto Rico, have in the last
few years moved into close
proximity on three sides of
the institution. And, like so
many institutions, this one
would not be averse to hav-
ing the Federal government
move in to rescue the uni-
versity from the situation
created by the improvidence
of its trustees. This, despite
the fact that there are repre-
sented on the present board
of trustees financial institu-
tions with sufficient means to
buy many times the acreage
to prevent the area from dis-
integrating into slums.
I do not suggest that the
university's needs are in-
volved in the present Presi-
dential program. I simply say
that Presidents, like other
men, argue from the small
island of what they know out
into the great sea of what
they don't know.
★
The bare facts that con-
cern taxpayers everywhere,
from Presque Isle to San
Diego, are these. Read and
buy if you will, but don't
say you were not warned.
1-The President is ask-
ing Congress to join him in
a policy which frankly ac-
cepts the responsibility of
the Federal government to
see that slum conditions are
eliminated and that declin-
ing neighborhoods be rehabil-
itated.
2-The President is asking
that the Federal government
pledge itself to increase its
building of tax-free and gov-
ernment-owned and operated
units from the present rate
of 20,000 a year to 35,000.
This is to involve a total com-
mitment now of 140,000 units.
3-This will cost, over the
whole period, $2,000,000,000,
and probably the loss of rev-
enue and cost of services not
paid for by token remittances
in lieu of taxes will cost lo-
cal governments about
$1,000,000,000 more.
4-The Federal govern-
ment becomes a master plan-
ner and provides some mil-
lions to enable cities and met-
ropolitan communities to
plan themselves.
5-The government,
through the FHA, has a con-
tingent liability of approxi-
mately $17,000,000,000, of
which it has about 2% in re-
serves. It is proposed to in-
crease that liability and to
authorize borrowing from the
Treasury if there is difficulty
in selling the debentures in-
volved.

Since President Eisenhow-
er is so rapidly learning the
practical ways of politics,
some of his advisers should
tell him that public housing
has lost its glamour with the
man in the street, That was
abundantly shown in the Los
Angeles election last May. I
have also found it to be true
in New York City..
Those who rent are awak-
ening to the fact that indi-
rectly but inexorably the cost
of subsidizing the rent of
some is visited in taxes on the
landlord and he in turn pass-
es it on to the tenant,
The people are again ahead
of their government. The
President's proposals are
thus not only doubtful eco-
nomics but doubtful politics,
too.
