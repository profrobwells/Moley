KILLING OF
A CRAFT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last week the American
Watch Manufacturers Asso-
ciation, consisting of Elgin
National, Hamilton, and Wal-
tham, presented their case for
additional protection from the
flood of Swiss competition.
The loss they have sus-
tained in the American mar-
ket has been very serious in-
deed. In 1930, Swiss imports
of watch movements had 65%
of the American market. Now
they have 86%. Meanwhile,
employment has been falling
rapidly in the American in-
dustry.
*
The greatest loss was dur-
ing the second world war,
when the American govern-
ment required the American
makers to turn to war work.
Meanwhile, the thrifty Swiss
moved even more vigorously
into the gap thus created. If
this continues, the American
industry, as far as movements
are concerned, will be gone
with the cigar store Indian,
the horse car, and the hoop
skirt.
But this is not all. The loss
of the American market to
the American industry has
been a continuing one, keep-
ing pace with two major de-
velopments over the last two
decades. The first of these
has been steady tariff reduc-
tions under the guidance of
an internationally minded
State Department. The other
has been the vast upsurge of
the labor movement. With
these handicaps at home, it is
impossible for Americans to
compete with the government
sponsorship and cheaper la-
bor that characterize Swiss
competition.
Those who favor free trade
have a habit of advising the
American watchmakers to
go into some other business.
Characteristic of this is the
minority statement of David
J. McDonald of the United
Steel Workers in the recently
released Randall report.
*
He suggests that industries
injured by lowering of tariffs
be brought under the downy
wing of government paternal-
ism. He suggested an "adjust-
ment assistance program."
Workers thrown out of jobs
in which they have devoted
their lives to the acquisition
of fine skills would receive
a "counseling and placement"
program. They would, while
finding new employment, get
"special training allowances."
Those too old to be retrained
and rehabilitated would be re-
tired with government insur-
ance.
The amazing thing about
this paternalistic chatter is
that it comes from a labor
leader. There were American
labor leaders in earlier days
who would have disdained
such welfare-state arrange-
ments. But seemingly the
CIO has gone the Socialist
way of British labor.
Aside from the argument
on the basis of the freedom
of Americans to follow their
own inclinations as to what
they shall make and sell and
what professions and trades
they shall choose to enter,
there is the security case.
During the second world
war, when the Swiss re-
mained neutral, Hamilton
could not sell a watch. While
the Swiss made further in-
roads into the American
watch market, Hamilton
turned out timing devices
for weapons, watches, chro-
nometers and navigational
timepieces for the military.
*
In any future war, it
would be essential to have
such an industry within our
borders. Testimony of the
military establishment has
made this all too clear.
The watch and clock indus-
tries of the British were de-
stroyed before World War II,
since the Germans deliberate-
ly put into effect procedures
that ruined them. Fred Lux,
of the Lux Clock Manufactur-
ing Co., has pointed out: "If
it were not for the tariff pro-
tection which permitted the
American clock industry to
remain strong, there would
have been no source in the
world for Great Britain ini-
tially and our own armed
forces ultimately from which
to procure the vitally neces-
sary timing devices required."
In 1952, although the Tar-
iff Commission recommended
greater protection for the
American producers of
watches, Harry Truman saw
fit to ignore it. In the inter-
est of national security the
present Tariff Commission
should arrive at much the
same conclusions as its pred-
ecessor. This time an admin-
istration may act with great-
er wisdom.
