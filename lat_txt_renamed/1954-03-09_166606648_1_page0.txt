DEFLATING
A MYTH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I wish to draw attention to
a hit of mythology with
which writers, professors,
statesmen and others who
should know better have been
obsessed for more than a cen-
tury. It has indeed been re-
sponsible for a century-long
witch hunt.
I am not speaking here of
those members of Congress
and others who have per-
formed a great public service
in exposing Communists and
their friends in government
and in educational institu-
tions.
I am referring to a false
statement of historical fact
which has furnished half the
argument for those who have
proposed revolutionary
change in our society.
That statement of fact-that-
is-not-fact is that the rise of
mechanical industrialism has
been attended by parallel im-
poverishment of workers.
This was the very corner-
stone of the revolutionary
creed of Marx and Engels. It
was spread into innumerable
books and legislative propos-
als by sentimentalists in Eng-
land and the United States.
It was accepted uncritically
by a large part of the so-called
intellectual classes of both
nations.
It has become embedded in
the histories that have taught
millions of children. It is
anti-industrial and anticap-
italist. And without it the de-
lusion of Socialism might nev-
er have captured the minds of
so many otherwise sane peo-
ple.
This delusion is briefly and
clearly exposed in a little
book recently issued by the
University of Chicago Press
and edited by F. A. Hayek. It
is called, "Capitalism and the
Historians."
Prof. T. S. Ashton of the
University of London, who
contributes the first article,
completely demolishes the
Marxian hypothesis—it was
never more than that—that
industrialism ushered in pov-
erty with all its distressing
trimmings.
The point in Ashton's es-
say is that historians drew
most of their factual infor-
mation from the reports of
royal commissions and com-
mittees of inquiry which in-
vestigated the condition of
the working classes during
the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s.
Those reports dealt as a
matter of course with what
was bad, with what needed
correction. Governments nev-
er appoint committees to
write glowing accounts of
what is present in society.
They are quite properly ap-
pointed, just as our Congres-
sional committees are appoint-
ed, to probe into what is
wrong and needs correction
by some form of legislation.
Compare, for example, the
report of the Senate commit-
tee a few years back on the
RFC with the fine book of
Jesse Jones on the work of
that institution. Both are
true. But the Senate report
dealt not only with a different
period but with conditions
that needed correction.
Quite as a matter of course
also historians turn to such
reports as source material.
They are regarded as of much
higher authenticity than the
mere writings of individual
observers. They enjoy that
designation, "government re-
ports," so treasured by people
who want to make a case.
Following Ashton's essay is
one by a brilliant American
economic historian, Louis
Hacker of Columbia. Hacker
shows how American his-
torians such as Beard and
Gustavus Myers were infected
with this delusion and passed
it on into our schools and col-
leges.
Even Henry George, a
stanch enemy of Socialism,
writing in the 1870s and 1880s
fell for the delusion. Hence
the great paradox of "prog-
ress and poverty."
Facts won't lie, but unfor-
tunately people may get hold
of the wrong facts.
