The death of Will H. Hays
marks the passing of an au-
thentic genius in the ancient,
fine-drawn art of politics.
In the 22 years during
which he occupied a position
in the motion-picture indus-
try which was mistakenly
called that of a "czar," no
artist in that field in acting
or directing ever excelled the
skill he had established in his
own field of politics. Well be-
fore the movies discovered
Hays, he had pulled together
a broken and beaten Repub-
lican Party, won a Congress,
and then moved on to a gigan-
tic majority for the weakest
President in our time.

Hays was bred to politics
as was Mozart to music. He
was precinct committeeman
when he cast his first vote. At
38 he was at the head of the
Republican Party. In the in-
terim he held every chair-
manship on the way to the
top.
His rise was far from acci-
dental. He always had the in-
finite capacity of seeming to
be commonplace while he cal-
culated with uncommon skill.
In many contacts with him,
for he selected me to write
the history of his career in
the movies, I marveled at
how he could talk at great
length without seeming to say
anything. Finally I learned
that generally he used lan-
guage mainly not to reveal
but to conceal thought.
*
What he was saying often
had little to do with what he
was thinking. I then learned
to get advice on a complex
political question by surpris-
ing him. I would call him on
the telephone and ask point-
blank what I wanted to know.
His first few sentences were
ripe and precious wisdom.
Then he caught himself and
talked generalities. He did not
mean to do this. It was the
prompting of instinct.
He knew Main St. so well
and could sense it so perfect-
ly because he was a member
of that community himself.
When he was Postmaster
General a deeply understand-
ing writer, Edward Lowry,
said of him:
"He is the 100% American.
He is as indigenous as sassa-
frass root. He is one of us.
He is folks. He is a human
river. He takes you there
and brings you back. If some
alchemist in biology (if you
know what I mean) could ex-
tract the essential juices from
Mr. Addison-Sims and all the
typical Rotarians, he might
produce a pale synthetic Will
Hays. But there would still
be qualities missing."
*
It was this uncanny quality
of knowing public opinion
that made him so important
to the movie industry. When
Hays was selected, the movie
people were feeling the hot,
angry breath of Main St. on
their necks.
He conceived his job to be
divided into three parts. First,
he must save the movies from
the grim threat of many State
censoring authorities. This
was to be done, he thought,
by conveying to the industry
a warning of the imminence
of danger. He explained this
part of his work by telling a
story about George Eastman.
When he told that great pio-
neer in motion-picture photog-
raphy what he was doing,
Eastman said: "In short, you
are the cat's whiskers."
Next, after the warning
came the remedy, which was
self-regulation, the only au-
thentic answer to State regu-
lation. It took years to get
the production code and years
more to get it enforced. But
Hays had the patience re-
quired.
*
Finally, he got the movie
men to produce better and
more artistic pictures.
It is not too much to say
that the fact that this indus-
try has risen above the moral
cesspool in which it spent
much of its youth is due in
large part to the warnings,
the proddings, the exhorta-
tions and the inspiration of
Will Hays.
But the lesson he taught
not only the motion-picture
industry but all Americans
was that government is not
only a benefit but a threat.
He knew that Americans
must not only regulate them-
selves, but support them-
selves. This is the only way
to fend off the paralyzing em-
brace of state power.
