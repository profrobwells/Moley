Five-Billion Dollar Plan
for the Upper Colorado
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Department of the In-
terior, backed by the Pres-
ident, is recommending to
Congress for authorization a
tremendous water storage,
power-producing and irriga-
tion project in the upper val-
ley of the Colorado River and
its tributaries.
This will cost initially an
estimated $1,000,000,000 when
completed, but something
like $5,000,000,000 will ulti-
mately be required. Utah
would be the State most im-
mediately benefited, with Col-
orado next, and New Mexico
and Wyoming next in order.

While this plan has been a
long time in preparation, its
presentation now has a spe-
cial political significance. For
the Eisenhower administra-
tion has been accused by pub-
lic power people, including a
number of organizations offi-
cered by former Truman em-
ployees, of scuttling the Fed-
eral power developments and
of turning over to private de-
velopment "the priceless re-
sources of the nation."
The central theme in this
attack has been the with-
drawal of the Interior De-
partment's opposition to the
building of three dams on the
Snake River in the Hell's
Canyon region.
The Upper Colorado plan
now proposed would harness
water assigned to the Upper
Colorado States in an inter-
state compact negotiated at
the time Hoover Dam was
built.
The two major units of this
plan are the construction of
dams and storage facilities
and power plants at Glen
Canyon and Echo Park. The
Glen Canyon Dam would be
built at a point on the Colo-
rado River upward from
Grand Canyon and slightly
below the Arizona State line.
This dam would be a very
large power producer.

Echo Park is in Dinosaur
National Monument, far up
on the Green River close to
the juncture of Utah, Colo-
rado and Wyoming. The pro-
posed building of a dam and
storage project at Echo Park
has provoked wild outcries
from nature lovers because
of the unsurpassed beauty
of the place. The river flows
deep through an almost inac-
cessible canyon.
The Interior Department
has surveyed all the possible
alternative sites to meet this
objection, but they all would
expose the stored water to
evaporation at a very high
rate, while the Echo Park
lake would be a shady, shel-
tered chasm. And so the de-
partment has decided to save
the water and sacrifice some
scenery.
There are other storage
dams in the over-all project,
but those mentioned are the
big ones.
A large number of irriga-
tion areas would be devel-
oped with the impounded
water.
The suggestion made in the
U.S. News and World Re-
port that this is another
TVA is absurd. There are no
similarities except the ele-
ment of subsidy by the Fed-
eral government.
The real controversy will
and should center upon the
immense and partially hidden
subsidy to the irrigation dis-
tricts that would be included
in the project.
★
The State of California has
already called attention to
this feature. It contends that
the Collbran formula, which
is proposed to be used to
govern the repayment of the
funds advanced for irrigation
out of the proceeds of the
sale of electric power, is an
indefensible departure from
traditional practice in mak-
ing irrigation pay its way
over a period of years. This
departure has been due to the
patent fact that irrigation is,
from year to year, becoming
an economically unfeasible
extravagance.
Plainly, the parts of the
desert that can be made to
bloom like the rose are be-
coming less and less able to
pay their way. The large
States whose taxpayers must
shoulder the subsidy in-
volved are becoming more
and more wary of such proj-
ects. And California, once an
undeveloped "reclama-
tion" State, is now one of
those big, tax-burdened
States.
