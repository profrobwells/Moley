No New Yorker who is free
from hopeless partisan preju-
dice can fail to offer fervent
praise for the administrative
achievements of Gov. Dewey
and Robert Moses, whose
titles are too numerous to
mention. Both are money-
honest, vigorous public ser-
vants whose contributions
will live far beyond the life
of this present generation.
It is disconcerting, there-
fore, to find them violently
opposing and thus delaying
what seems on examination
to be a sound and sensible
plan for the development of
more power from Niagara by
private, state-regulated enter-
prise. Their arguments, un-
like most of their pronounce-
ments on State and city gov-
ernment, neglect simple eco-
nomics and fall back upon
nostalgic pictures of past New
York statesmen who fought
the "power trust" and won
elections by that method.
These men, who would vig-
orously claim that they are
very much up to date and
new-looky on all matters
governmental, sound like an-
cients recounting the perils
and glories of battles long
ago.
Aside from the efforts of
Sen. Lehman and Rep.
F. D. R. Jr. to get the Fed-
eral government into the Ni-
agara development, there are
three proposals before Con-
gress.
The first is embodied in
the Miller-Capehart bill,
which passed the House last
July by an overwhelming ma-
jority.
The second is a bill inspired
by Gov. Dewey which would
turn over the job of new-pow-
er development at Niagara to
the New York Power Author-
itv.
The estimated cost of the
development in case either of
these bills passes would be
about $400,000,000. The job to
be done would involve taking
water out of the Niagara Riv-
er above the falls and,
through a tunnel or aqueduct,
carrying it to a power sta-
tion near the mouth of the
river on Lake Ontario.
A third proposal, which
now seems to be favored by
Dewey and Moses, is to leave
the decision to the Federal
Power Commission,
If the speed of judgment
of this body is to be meas-
ured by its present Hell's Can-
yon hearings, a decision on
this matter might be expected
in a couple of years.
It would seem, especially
at this time when more jobs
are in immediate demand,
that common sense would let
the five private companies un-
der the Miller-Capehart bill
go ahead and use private
money for the development.
Ample protection for the
consumers of electricity is
provided by the regulatory
power of New York. That
protection, we may assume,
has been the concern of Gov.
Dewey, who has been in of-
fice more than 11 years.
The private development
would, moreover, provide
$23,000,000 more taxes an-
nually for the various gov-
ernments concerned.
After all, the consumer is
mainly concerned with get-
ting cheap electricity and
lower taxes. The question of
who is supplying it is, in
these days of strict regula-
tion, highly theoretical. That
view is apparently what ap-
pealed to the Republican Con-
gressmen from New York
who voted, 26 to 1, for the
Miller-Capehart bill.
This project differs in vital
respects from the TVA and
the various Columbia and
Colorado River hydroelectric
projects. The case for gov-
ernment-produced electric
power has always rested up-
on one of three justifications:
First, that the development
is too large or too remote in
its prospect of pay-off for pri-
vate enterprise. This is one
of the criteria recently estab-
lished by Secretary McKay
for the undertaking of Feder-
al projects. No such condi-
tion is present at Niagara. If
Gov. Dewey had not inter-
vened, dirt would be flying
now and jobs would be cre-
ated.
Second, that there are
functions in the project which
are the sole and legitimate
concern of government, such
as flood control, navigation,
irrigation or the preservation
of wild life. None of these
are involved at Niagara. This
is exclusively a power proj-
ect.
Third, that there is the
well-worn "yard stick" idea
used by Franklin Roosevelt
years ago. The point was that
it was necessary to have a
sort of pilot or experimental
plant in order to give the
government the basis of rate-
fixing, etc. This certainly
does not apply here. It is not
even mentioned as an excuse.
For in doing so, Dewey would
be stultifying his own regu-
latory authorities.
There is another, unmen-
tioned reason, of course,
which is to create a political
issue. Surely Dewey, despite
his long experience, is not
wiser in the business of get-
ting votes than all 26 of his
fellow Republicans in the
House. They must get elected,
too, and some were in politics
when Dewey was in grammar
school.
