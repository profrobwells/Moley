ECONOMY IS
POSSIBLE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The front page of a finan-
cial paper a day or two ago
carried two major stories.
One dealt with the retreat of
Secretary Benson under the
pressure of new and bigger
farm surpluses to a resort to
crop curbs.
The other told of the plans
of the adminstration to push
the building of many public
works, in part at Federal ex-
pense.

Before we consider these
items, let us recall another
story that came out of Wash-
ington last week, to the effect
that the President, the Direc-
tor of the Budget and the
Secretary of the Interior had
urged the Congress to author-
ize a vast irrigation and pow-
er project in the basin of
the upper Colorado River.
A few days ago I presented
in this column some of the
facts about the immense hid-
den subsidy for irrigation in-
volved in this scheme. For
in the interest of present and
future economy there should
be a brake rather than an ac-
celerator applied to irrigation
schemes which have in re-
cent years become utterly un-
economical. In fact, some of
the proposed ones will re-
quire a subsidy of more than
$1000 to produce an acre
worth $150. And the prod-
ucts the acres yield will re-
quire another, undetermined
subsidy.
And, while we are at it,
let us note that smart Demo-
crats are already planning to
hurl at the Republicans in
the White House and the
Congress the fact that in Sep-
tember, 1952, Messrs. Eisen-
hower and Taft issued a joint
statement promising a budg-
et for fiscal 1955 of $60,000,-
000,000.

And let it be added that the
story on public works car-
ried the extraordinary state-
ment that "administration
economists" say that con-
struction has lagged far be-
hind in the last few years
"due to war and inflation."
That is measurably true. But
are we to conclude that the
remedy is to create more in-
flation? For every dollar
added to the inevitable defi-
cit in fiscal 1955 is inflation-
ary.
From all this it is not an
unfair deduction that the eco-
nomic direction of the ad-
ministration is, to say the
least, confused.
Into this confusion there
comes a sane and authorita-
tive report by the Committee
on Federal Tax Policy, a
group which was established
10 years ago and which from
time to time has issued ex-
ceedingly intelligent apprais-
als of the state of Federal
finances. Its chairman is Ros-
well Magill, former Under-
secretary of the Treasury.

With ample details the
present report points out the
many places where the Fed-
eral government can save
money with no injury to de-
fense or national stability. It
concludes that if these cuts
were resolutely proposed by
the administration and sus-
tained by Congress, the Taft-
Eisenhower promise of 1952
could easily be kept.
It also makes clear how
misleading is the alibi so com-
monly made that substantial
savings are impossible be-
cause most of our money
goes for defense and for the
payment for past wars in
debt service and veterans'
benefits. There is a good $20,-
000,000,000 wholly outside de-
fense, and very substantial
savings can be made there.
In fact, the civil expenditures
of the government in 1955
will, after all the big talk
about economy, run substan-
tially above the average of
the Truman years.
Meanwhile, this report
clearly demonstrates that tax
rates have already reached
the point of diminishing re-
turns. Hence, the choice is
either courageous economy or
inflation.

FAMOUS
FABLES
BY E. E. EDGAR

Although his early works
met with little success, Au-
thor Jack London doggedly
continued to submit stories
to editors. Once, when he was
entertaining a friend, the lat-
ter asked:
"How are you getting along
with your writing?"
"Pretty well," said the au-
thor. "I finished two stories
this month."
"I didn't mean that," said
the other. He pointed to the
pile of manuscripts on the
table. "Are you getting any
returns from your efforts?"
"Of course," replied Lon-
don. "Practically all are re-
turned."
