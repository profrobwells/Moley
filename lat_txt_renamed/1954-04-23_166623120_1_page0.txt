READING
FOR IKE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

When the President, with
cameras clicking, singles out
a book for honorable men-
tion, it is news of importance.
In the instance to which I re-
fer, moreover, the book in
question has a profound bear-
ing in its own right upon cur-
rent affairs and upon meas-
ures now before Congress.

The book is the great clas-
sic, "Democracy in America,"
written by Alexis de Tocque-
ville in the 1830s. It was one
of a number of great books
presented to the President by
St. John's College of Annapo-
lis, an institution which is in
a notable way seeking to re-
enlist the interest of students
in the classics of the past. Ac-
cording to the news story, the
President ran his eye down
the list and paused at De
Tocqueville's work, saying:
"There's the one I've looked
for for a long time."
Now that the President has
it, I would suggest that he
turn to the conclusions of
this sympathetic student of
the great experiments in the
United States. For the obser-
vations which De Tocqueville
made were in truth enlight-
ened by prophetic genius, far
more, it may be added, than
those of any other foreign
observer.

The heart of his thesis lies
in his interpretation of the
peril that would ultimately
threaten this happy land. He
said that we need not fear
"tyrants" but "guardians."
"I have always thought,"
he said, "that servitude of the
regular, quiet and gentle kind
... might be combined more
easily with some of the out-
ward forms of freedom, and
that it might even establish
itself under the wing of the
sovereignty of the people."
Indeed, he might have add-
ed, it might even establish it-
self within the very heart of
the Constitution by an ex-
pansion of the welfare clause.
He might have learned of
that peril from Jefferson him-
self, who spoke more than
once of the danger in giving
Congress "unlimited powers
to provide for the general
welfare." Recent interpreta-
tions of the Constitution,
however, have brought us
close to that danger.

De Tocqueville goes on to
describe the possible fate of
American democracy:
"I trace the novel features
under which despotism may
appear in the world . . .
Above this race of men stands
an immense and tutelary
power . . . absolute, minute,
provident and mild . . . For
their happiness such a gov-
ernment willingly labors, but
it chooses to be the sole
agent and only arbiter of
their happiness; it provides
for their security, foresees and
supplies their necessities, fa-
cilitates their pleasures, man-
ages their principal concerns,
directs their industry, regu-
lates the descent of property,
and subdivides their inherit-
ances. The will of man is
not shattered, but softened,
bent and guided till each
nation is reduced to nothing
better than a flock of timid
and industrious animals, of
which the government is the
shepherd."
That, Mr. President, is a
description of the welfare
state, the virtues of which
some of your advisers are
presenting to you.
