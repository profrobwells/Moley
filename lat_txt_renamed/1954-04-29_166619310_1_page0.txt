THE PARKS
INVASION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the vast Upper Colorado
power and irrigation project,
even the initial stages of
which will cost $1,000,000,000
and which the administration
is supporting, one of the units
is a power dam and reservoir
in Dinosaur National
Monument, at a spot called
Echo Park near the Utah-
Colorado line.
While the larger project
will cost the taxpayers over
the nation plenty and for
generations to come, for the
benefit of a relatively small
number of farmers, there has
been little protest in Congress
or in the press. But the
proposal to invade a national
recreation area has stirred a
veritable storm over the four
years since the proposal was
first made.
Dinosaur National Monument
was established in 1915
to protect, in the interests of
science, an 80-acre deposit of
dinosaur fossils. Later, the
scenic and recreational values
of the canyons of the Green
and Yampa Rivers were recognized, and the area of the
monument was greatly expanded.

Easy access to the beauty
spots has not yet been established, but every year
more and more visitors come
and see and are conquered by
the incomparable grandeur.
Plenty of evidence has been
presented to Congress by nature
lovers who have explored the
place by boat that nothing in
the United States compares
with it.
There are other sites in
the Colorado basin where a
dam and reservoir could be
built which would produce as
much power and storage of
water, but the overriding consideration in the decision to
build in the monument has
been a matter of loss of water
by evaporation. Comparable
studies have been made of
this loss, and it is claimed
by the Interior Department
that the Dinosaur site represents greater economy of
water.
This contention has been
vigorously denied. In fact,
Gen. U.S. Grant III, speaking
with a background of half a
century as an Army engineer,
claimed in his testimony that
there is no valid or scientific
basis for predictions as to
rates of evaporation.
Gen. Grant, who in this instance was testifying as a
representative of the American Civic and Planning Association, made a most impressive showing on all aspects of the proposal, not
only on the relative values of
alternative sites to Echo
Park but on the question of
the excessively high prices
that must be charged for power in a market which is only
partially developed now.

This proposed invasion of
a national park or monument
is only one of many that have
been made in the past by
local interests, or members of
Congress, or the Bureau of
Reclamation. Innumerable
battles have been fought over
these, and many more to
come.
One exception was made
over violent opposition in the
building of the Hetch Hetchy
and Lake Eleanor Dams in
Yosemite Park in 1913,
mainly to supply water for
the city of San Francisco.
Three years later the Park
Service of the Interior Department was established,
which has effectively opposed
further invasions.
Finally, in 1935, Congress
specifically prohibited the
Federal Power Commission
from issuing licenses for the
construction of water storage
or power projects in national
parks or monuments. The
Park Service says of the present proposal that the values
of Dinosaur would be "irreparably damaged" by its construction.
Over the 82 years since Yellowstone Park was established tradition has held that
recreation areas shall be held
inviolable.
It would seem that the administration is on very shaky
ground in attempting to break
that tradition with only
doubtful scientific and economic reasons to justify it.
