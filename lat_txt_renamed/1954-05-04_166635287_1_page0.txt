BOOKS KEPT
STRANGELY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

HOUSTON, Tex.—I regret
the necessity of devoting
three successive columns to
one subject, the Upper Colora-
do storage and irrigation proj-
ect. But it is a big subject in-
volving billions, and it may
in a small way provide some
readers with a relief from the
sordid, disgraceful show go-
ing on over what Cohn or
Adams or somebody else did
or did not.

I find no one on this trip
through several States who is
not getting pretty sick of the
whole business.
With the deadly dice of
peace and war rattling at Ge-
neva, with Congress spend-
ing like mad, with a holdover
bureaucracy playing hide and
seek with the earnest but po-
litically inexperienced busi-
nessmen whom the President
has summoned to his side, it
would seem that there are
matters to concern us other
than whether a couple of fel-
lows named Joe were cut off
a picture of Secretary Ste-
vens and Pvt. Schine.
And so let us look again
at the authorization of the Up-
per Colorado project that the
interested Congressmen and
Senators are rushing through
while all eyes are on the
McCarthy committee.

I have already shown the
strange bookkeeping in-
volved, the colossal subsidy
to irrigation, and the unnec-
essary and irreparable dam-
age to one of the nation’s
great natural wonders. I sub-
mit an excellent summary
written by an experienced en-
gineer, Alexander Hilde-
brand, in a letter from him to
the President:
“I have studied the Bureau
of Reclamation reports on
the Colorado River storage
project and the testimony in
hearings before the House
Subcommittee on Irrigation
and Reclamation. Adequate
answers to the following
questions are essential. . .

“1—Why don’t we build
the largest, most beneficial
and economically sound unit
of the upper basin proposal
first and withhold authoriza-
tion of the balance pending
further study? Glen Canyon
Dam is far more economic
than Echo Park Dam and in-
volves no national monu-
ment. It will take a long time
to fill both dams and develop
power loads for both power
plants, and there is admitted
to be a serious question as to
whether there is enough wa-
ter available to utilize the en-
tire project and produce the
assumed power revenue.

“2—Many thousands of in-
dependent voters are im-
pressed by the Democrats’
claim that the Echo Park
Dam invasion of the park
system is an example of the
Republican ‘giveaway’ pro-
gram. . . . The Bureau of
Reclamation leaves explana-
tion very difficult when they
(1) propose to charge most
of the Echo Park Dam cost
to power; (2) admit that
steam power would cost very
little more; (3) admit that
the dam is not needed for wa-
ter diversion; (4) say that
they would not recommend
Echo Park Dam except to
avoid evaporation losses; (5)
release figures which show
that a larger Glen Canyon
dam would store as much
water as their two proposed
dams with less total evapora-
tion; and (6) admit that they
have quoted incorrect, incon-
sistent, and uncertain evapo-
ration loss figures.

“3—Why should power
users subsidize irrigation wa-
ter users to such an extent
that no realistic limit is
placed on the cost of irrigat-
ing an acre of land especially
when we are plagued with
crop surpluses?

“4—How can the public
have confidence in the
bureau’s recommendations
when any competent indi-
vidual studying their reports
finds inconsistencies, arith-
metic errors, and absurd
economies such as examples
brought out in the House
hearings?

“5—How can people accept
the argument that Echo Dam
will only ‘alter’ the scenic
river canyons? Would a 500-
foot-high dam only alter
Yosemite Valley?

“In summary I entreat you
to recognize the errors in the
Bureau of Reclamation’s pro-
posal and withdraw adminis-
tration support from Echo
Park Dam, restricting sup-
port to Glen Canyon Dam
and any diversion facilities
which are outside of the
parks, monuments, and es-
tablished wilderness areas
and which meet legitimate
economic criteria.”
