TEXAS' WAY WITH RACE RELATIONS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are right ways and
wrong ways of dealing with
racial and nationalistic dif-
ferences and antagonisms.
One of the wrong ways is
coercive measures at the
Federal level. In fact, any
coercive measure is likely to
be a wrong way. And cer-
tainly any Federal effort, co-
ercive or noncoercive, is
wrong.
There remains, however, a
means based on common
sense, decency and persua-
sive suggestion. That can be
done by private organizations
or by a local or State agen-
cy supported by local or
State government.

The best example I have
seen of a workable and sen-
sible attack upon this prob-
lem is the Good Neighbor
Commission of Texas. For
a great many years—in fact,
ever since Texas ceased to
be a part of Mexico—there
had been recurring problems
over the treatment in that
State of Mexicans who came
across the border in search
of opportunities for better
economic conditions. Their
labor was welcome and the
pay was good. But they were
denied certain privileges and
prerogatives and were often
subjected to outbreaks of in-
tolerance.
Finally, during the war, in
1913 when Mexicans were
coming in legally and ille-
gally in great numbers, the
Mexican government began
to register sharp diplomatic
protests against the treat-
ment of its nationals in Tex-
as.
As a result, Gov. Coke Ste-
venson on his own authority
set up a Good Neighbor Com-
mission to give effect to a
policy of the State which he
declared to be to give full
and equal accommodations,
advantages and privileges to
Mexicans and other Latin
Americans residing in or vis-
iting the State. Four years
later this commission was
given full legal status by the
Legislature.
According to an interesting
new history of the first 10
years of the Texas Good
Neighbor Commission by Nel-
lie Ward Kingrea, the first
two years of the commission
were devoted to securing by
good offices and persuasion
better educational and health
advantages for the Mexicans,
young and old. Then there
followed a period during
which the problems of labor
relations and conditions were
the main concern.

The first chairman of the
commission was Robert E.
Smith, who won respect and
honor from his fellow Texans
as well as the government of
Mexico by his outstanding
services. Five years ago
Smith was succeeded by Nel-
lie G. Penrose, a resident
of Ft. Worth who had over
the years maintained many
business connections in Mex-
ico. Since his appointment
Penrose has given almost full
time to the commission.
The Penrose policies are
based upon great common
sense and patience. He has
avoided recourse either to an
overdose of welfare, with
all the attendant conferences
and paternalism which it in-
volves, or to anything that
suggests coercion of either
Mexicans or Texans.
★
His motto is eternal vigi-
lance. Wherever discrimina-
tion appears the good offices
of the commission are enlist-
ed. Persuasion rather than
threats or pressure is used to
iron out even small instances
of discrimination. For Pen-
rose well realizes that in mat-
ters of racial relations serious
results can come from small
beginnings. He has fostered
through his influence in Tex-
as a great increase in the
teaching of Spanish in the
schools and also attention to
the history of our neighbor-
ing Latin-American nations.
An exchange of teachers
between Mexico and Texas
has also been promoted. Fi-
nally, by publicity relating
to instances of friendly rela-
tions Penrose has sought to
minimize the occasional sto-
ries of prejudice and discrim-
ination.
This, it would seem, is an
example of the right way to
deal with an old and trouble-
some problem.
