BUILDING
SHIPS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the various results
of the building of the St.
Lawrence Seaway will be the
sharpening of many inland
cities in the problems of an
American merchant marine.
And never in recent years has
there been more need for
such interest and support.
One of the most astonishing
of our government's give-
away gestures was the ap-
pearance in the Randall re-
port, two months ago, of a
suggestion that we help our
brethren across the seas by
neglecting our own merchant
shipping and by using for our
commerce foreign-flag ships.

This recommendation, plus
the fact that the President's
budget contained no provi-
sion at all for new passenger
or merchant ships, deepened
the discouragement of leaders
in our maritime industry. For
they have for a long time
been warning us that there
is grave danger that we shall
repeat the folly which has
caught us unprepared in two
world wars.
Already the fleet built at
horrible expense and in fran-
tic haste during World War
II is disintegrating in idle-
ness, while foreign nations,
invigorated by American dol-
lars, are plying the seven
seas. It is estimated that
within 10 years 80% of our
cargo and passenger ships
will be obsolete.

A very encouraging gesture
has come from the adminis-
tration in the form of a com-
prehensive report prepared
under the direction of Under-
secretary of Commerce Rob-
ert B. Murray Jr. entitled
"Maritime Subsidy Policy."
This report is a strong
warning and a strong plea. It
points out that our maritime
policy created by the notable
legislation of 1936 is so funda-
mental to the national inter-
est that it should be given
primary consideration at this
time; that present world con-
ditions require a program to
fulfill the policies which have
been the law of the land since
1936; that experience in two
wars teaches us that we must
depend upon our own ships
for our own safety; and that a
construction program of at
least 60 ocean-going ships a
year is essential to maintaining
our shipping and shipbuilding
industry at a safe level.
The report recommends
subsidies which would put
the U.S. merchant fleet and
shipyards on an equal foot-
ing with foreign competition.
Such appropriations as con-
struction-differential and op-
erating-differential subsidies
are, of course, essential.
To provide more funds for
construction it is suggested
that the government sell ship
mortgages.
To encourage shipping com-
panies to retire vessels to the
reserve fleet and to invest in
new ships, the report recom-
mends that accelerated depre-
ciation for new vessels be
adopted.
The report also recom-
mends that certain companies
not receiving subsidies de-
posit earnings in a construc-
tion reserve fund on a tax-
deferred basis.
Turning from some of the
recommendations that will re-
quire legislative action,
the Murray report presents
measures requiring adminis-
trative action. Among them
are a formal replacement of
vessels, a research and devel-
opment program, more effi-
cient use of men and ships in
the industry, and an attempt
to overcome or minimize the
effect of policies and prac-
tices of certain foreign coun-
tries which discriminate
against American-Flag ves-
sels.
Here is a government re-
port unique in our day. It
points up the importance to
the United States of one of its
vital industries and recom-
mends that the government
back up this industry.
