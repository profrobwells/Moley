Allan B. Kline, president
of the Farm Bureau Federa
tion, ranks very high among
this country's genuine agri
cultural statesmen. He has
for years opposed the trend
in agriculture toward more
and more dependence upon
government and in this he
has succeeded in carrying
along the very powerful or-
ganized group of which he is
head.
He has now uttered anoth-
er warning which should
carry great weight not only
with farmers but with all
Americans who are interest-
ed in a free economy.

Speaking at a convention
of the International Federa-
tion of Agricultural Produc
ers at Nairobi, Kenya, he
pointed to the danger of So-
cialism's coming in through
the back door through inter-
national commodity agree-
ments. He said that, despite
the alluring arguments of
those who believe that
through international action
there can be achieved price
stability, increased consump-
tion, fewer surpluses and
general goodwill, the cold
fact is that experience denies
those claims.
He cited the International
Wheat Agreement as an ex-
ample of frustrated hopes.
"What could the Internation-
al Wheat Agreement do in
the face of seriously falling
prices? If one agreement is
as difficult to sign and put
into effect as this one was,
how wise are farmers to put
their dependence on a dozen
such agreements?"
The best means of dealing
with surpluses, Kline be-
lieves, is parallel action by
individual countries. For
that reason he has promoted
international trade confer-
ences, such as the one now
being held at Nairobi.

Despite the obvious futility
and the great financial loss
to the United States in the
International Wheat Agree-
ment, the bureaucrats in the
State Department and in the
United Nations have indefat-
igably and consistently pro-
moted the idea of interna-
tional materials agreements
ever since 1915.
Over and over our State
Department has brought
back plans for machinery to
create international control
of this or that. And over and
over Congress has refused
to agree to them. So far only
the wheat pact has been
adopted.
As recently as last March
the State Department
brought home an internation-
al tin agreement. This pre-
cipitated a fight within the
administration itself. The In-
terior Department, and the
aid of Commerce and the
Treasury, opposed it and it
was finally decided that the
United States would not join.
Even more recently a new
move appeared in the Eco-
nomic Committee of the Unit-
ed Nations Economic and So-
cial Council. Argentina intro-
duced a resolution, again as
always in the magic name
"stability," providing for a
"permanent advisory commis-
sion on international com-
modity trade." This body
would study and prepare
for adoption measures for the
stabilization of primary com-
modity exports.
This was vigorously op-
posed by Preston Hotchkis,
our representative on the
council, but nevertheless it
was passed by a vote of 12
nations for, five against and
one, abstention.
The battle will be resumed
in the fall when the council
meets again. It is fortunate
that our case will be in the
hands of Hotchkis, an Ameri-
can businessman who is will-
ing to fight to keep our econ-
omy free. This will be a
wholesome contrast with the
bureaucrats who have repre-
sented the United States on
previous occasions.
