SPORTING
CHANCE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A scene reminiscent of the
dimout days of war was en-
acted on Broadway recently;
when most of the bright
lights were lowered. This was
one of the many means em-
ployed by movie exhibitors to
protest against the imposition
of a 5% admissions tax.
New York City, as always,
desperately seeking new rev-
enue and checkmated by the
Dewey administration from
various means of financial re-
lief, eagerly seized the oppor-
tunity when the Federal
government lowered its levy
on admissions from 20 to 10%.
The action of Congress was
in part prompted by great
pressure from the motion-pic-
ture industry and in part be-
cause of the pleas of
municipal and State officials.
The latter argued, and right-
ly, that admissions taxes
were, on most practical
grounds, a natural source for
local revenue.
No one can blame an in-
dustry or interest for arguing
for relief from taxes. Nor will
any fair-minded moviegoer in
New York City become too an-
noyed when the program
which he has paid very good
money to see is interrupted
by propaganda against the
"fun" tax.
But the logic and principles
of taxation are on the city's
side this time. The only un-
fortunate aspect of the matter
is that the Federal govern-
ment failed to get out of this
field of taxation entirely. For
taxes on admission should be
the exclusive province of the
State and city and never
should have been levied by
the Federal government.
There are three sound rea-
sons for allocating amusement
taxes to cities. First, the city
must provide fire, police, and
traffic protection and aid in
connection with most com-
mercialized amusements. Sec-
ond, it is easier for the city
to collect the tax than almost
any other, and it is easier for
the city than for the Federal
government. Finally, it has an
advantage in principle. For a
long-respected principle of
taxation is that, so far as pos-
sible, the taxpayer should
have some option about pay-
ing a tax. In short, he can
avoid this tax by getting his
amusement some other way.
The force of the first of
these arguments for the city
can be felt by anyone who
cares to walk along Broadway
any evening or who chooses
to stand before Madison
Square Garden on a prize-fight
or basketball night. Police and
fire protection must be at a
maximum in such places and
at such times. Traffic, more-
over, is a major problem. It
takes almost as many cops to
police a prize fight or one of
those gentle collegiate basket-
ball games as to guard the
President at the Waldorf.
The collection of the sales
tax in various cities and
States has proved to be not
only fairly easily adminis-
tered but very productive of
revenue. Another advantage
is that sales and amusement
taxes can be seen and felt by
the taxpayer.
The fact that an amusement
tax, like a sales levy, is visible
and direct satisfies a human
instinct as well as an estab-
lished principle of taxation.
The taxpayer has what might
be called a sporting chance.
He can pay or not.
And much as the motion-
picture industry merits our
sympathies for its troubles
with new forms of entertain-
ment, and much as we may
admire some of its achieve-
ments, it must be said that
it will work no great personal
hardship on any citizen to
stay away from some of the
trash currently offered. With
or without a tax, there is
no trouble suffered by the in-
dustry that better, not neces-
sarily more elaborate, pic-
tures will not cure.
