PURSUIT OF
TRUTH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a cautious interview
with the press after the final
decision on his case by the
Atomic Energy Commission,
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer
said that he hoped scholars
would read the record be-
cause "there is something to
be learned from it."
I can join in the hope that
a lot of scientists and several
publicists and others will
read not only the record, but
the record of what they said
in the public prints. For
without waiting for any pub-
lic report on the case and
even after the report of the
Gray Personnel Security
Board, many of Oppenheim-
er's scientific and journalis-
tic friends made a good many
foolish and mischievous state-
ments, and Sen. Morse rushed
to his feet saying, among
other things, that the Gray
report was schizophrenic.
★
In more measured terms
but with similar import, Van-
nevar Bush contributed a
long article in which he pre-
sumed to speak the minds of
"scientists generally."
One writer went so far as to
say that the United States
needed Oppenheimer more
than he needed the United
States. That is to say that,
after this nation has worried
along without all the distin-
guished departed Americans
of the past, we have at last
found the indispensable man.
Such comment also fails
to take account of the fact
that whatever Oppenhelmer
had of education, of oppor-
tunity for research and for
distinction, he could not have
had without the help of many
American agencies, public
and private.
There has also been the
open threat in many quarters
that scientists would no long-
er give their best, that they
would drag their feet or re-
fuse to serve their country if
Oppenheimer were declared
a risk.
This closely approaches
blackmail, and since the
commission has defied such
disloyal talk, it remains to be
seen if responsible scientists
will not by their actions and
words repudiate such sugges-
tions.
Another line of comment
was that Oppenheimer was
"politically immature" and,
for some curious reason, not
to be held responsible for his
chronic support of subver-
sive causes and persons. The
question raised by this is how
big a fool does an important
man have to be to be ab-
solved from responsibility for
his acts?

Vannevar Bush speaks of
the need that scientists be
"solidly united" and then con-
tinues by saying that "they
are united and they protest
what is now going on."
And so we have a group
which is essential to the na-
tional security presuming to
say that they and they alone
will decide what security
means. This, indeed, is ar-
rogating to a professional
group a function which in
the nature of things must be-
long to legally constituted
officers of government.
The determination of what
security means is a relative
thing, of course, but it is
something that some specific
somebody or somebodies must
define. And they must define
it in the light of the peril
that threatens our country.
Those somebodies have decid-
ed it will serve science as
well as the nation if scientists
get back to their laboratories
and go to work.
For scientists ought, after
reading the record, to recog-
nize two salient things. First,
that Oppenheimer in his dab-
bling with the Communists
was not pursuing the cause
of freedom. He was helping a
menacing power that has spe-
cifically repudiated the cause
of freedom.
Scientists also should recog-
nize that truth and the pur-
suit of truth is the basic
principle of a scientist. And
Oppenheimer was not behav-
ing in the light of that prin-
ciple when on one occasion
after another he told that
which was not the truth.
