HIGHWAY
TRAP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The last vestiges of the
ground beneath the President's
Commission on Inter-
governmental Relations, formerly
headed by Clarence
Manion, seem to be crumbling
away because of premature
recommendations by
the White House.
The major purpose of that
commission was to make
constructive suggestions for
the restoration of some of
the lost powers and responsibilities
of the States.
For in the past two or
three decades the Federal
monster has been seizing
more and more of the tax
sources of the States, for
which it returns a portion in
the form of grants-in-aid.
The most obvious and logical
of those sources is the
tax on gasoline and other
factors in highway travel.
The Governors were getting
ready at this year's conference
at Bolton Landing,
N.Y., to resolve strongly to
get this tax back for the
States and to build their
highways without much if
any Federal aid.
★
Some of the Governors had
already been considerably
upset by the big Federal
highway program which has
already been enacted.
Thus they were surprised
when they heard from the
Vice-President a rather
vague, but for them menacing,
suggestion that they
join with the Federal government
in a stupendous highway
expenditure of $50,000,000,000
over a period of 10
years.
This, it should be emphasized,
would be in addition
to the very large sums now
being spent by the Federal
government and the States
for highways.
The plan is, as I have
noted, vague. It would be
"a co-operative arrangement,"
so that "local" government
would be "the manager of
its own area."
To be "manager" would
presumably be to do the
building. But does this mean
local governments such as
counties and cities, or does
it mean States?
★
The money part of the
idea, it would seem, would
be for the Federal government
to advance funds or to
guarantee State and local obligations.
This presumably
would involve not only the
retention of the present Federal
taxes on gasoline but a
considerable increase in
their rate.
The basic reason why
there is need to return tax
sources and responsibilities
to the States is to retain the
principle of our Federal constitutional
system. But there
are other arguments favoring
the States.
One of those arguments is
the desirability of maintaining
State pride and interest
in highways. There is now a
friendly and wholesome
rivalry among the States in
road building.
Following the lead of
Pennsylvania, several States
are building or are planning
to build great trans-State
turnpikes. These in a few
years, with other good highways,
will make interstate
travel safer and faster.
Moreover, they can be made
to pay for themselves.
There is, moreover, in the
President's message to the
Governors, a suggestion that
highways are in a state of
primitive inadequacy. He
cites his experience as an
Army officer 35 years ago,
when he accompanied an
Army truck convoy in an experimental
transcontinental
trip.
He should travel the same
road now and realize that
while there is room for great
improvement, the comparison
is not relevant.
I have crossed the country
every year by automobile
since the end of World War
II and have seen a revolutionary
change.
This progress could be accelerated
by returning the
proper sources of taxation
to the States. In short, there
is no need, military or otherwise,
for such a gigantic program
as the President suggests.
The tax on gasoline is already
about all that the traffic
should be allowed to bear.
To add more pennies to the
gallon might well show that
we are at the point of diminishing
returns from that
source.
Finally, the President
should by this time realize
that there is a real and menacing
danger in Federal
spending of that sort.
There is already a very
considerable revival of the
old pork barrel racket in expenditures
for various purposes.
To offer a prize of
$5,000,000,000 a year would
make matters infinitely
worse.
For Congressmen denied
Federal jobs by the President's
scruples about politics
will find other ways to get
themselves re-elected — and
far more costly ways.
