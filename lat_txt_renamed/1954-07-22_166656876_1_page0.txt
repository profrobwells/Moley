VITO TRIES
COMEBACK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Vito Marcantonio, who for
seven years represented the
18th New York District in
Congress and was for years
the heart and soul and
mouthplece for the radical
American Labor Party, has
announced that he will at-
tempt this year to regain the
seat he lost In 1950.
He will run as an inde-
pendent, he says, because the
American Labor Party har-
bors a Communist element.
For some reason he never
complained of this element
in his party when he was in
Congress.
His candidacy will put this
contest squarely in the na-
tional spotlight, for he is a
formidable demagogue and
has a potent influence on the
left-wing elements in the
district.
â˜…
The district, which, inci-
dentally is where I live and
vote, is composed of an ex-
traordinary mixture of races,
nationalities, and economie
groups.
Roughly, it runs along the
East Side of Manhattan from
the East River at 59th St, to
a spot far to the north on the
Harlem River. To the west it
reaches almost to Park Ave.
Within this great area
there live more than 300,000
people. There are great num-
bers of Puerto Ricans, among
whom the Communist infec-
tion has made marked prog-
ress. There are many people
of Italian extraction who
used to be the main support
of the late Fiorello La Guar-
dia when he represented that
district. There is all of York-
ville, with a sturdy lot of
German origin. There are
many Irish and scatterings
of other nationalities.
Running along the East
River there is also a section,
heavily Republican, in which
fine apartments and rather
well-to-do people predomi-
nate. Over the entire district,
the Republican vote is about
25%. The rest of the votes
are divided among the Demo-
crats, the liberals and the re-
mains of the American Labor
Party.

Four years ago, the record
of Marcantonio became so
obnoxious that a coalition
was worked out by which
Democrats, Republicans and
liberals united behind James
J. Donovan, a Democrat.
Marcantonio was beaten
after a bitter fight marked
in spots by violence. Two
years later, Marcantonio did
not run and many rumors
were in circulation about his
failing health.
In 1953 the results of the
Mayoral election indicated
that almost the entire Amer-
ican Labor Party had moved
into the Democratic Party.
In fact, it was quite appar-
ent that the Communist line
of action that year was to
vote Democratic.
On the day after the elec-
tion Marcantonio resigned
from the ALP and in effect
pronounced it dead.
Donovan is a man of real
ability. Physically he resem-
bles the late Jimmy Walker.
His acute intelligence is also
reminiscent of the former
Mayor. But his industry is
decidedly greater and his
political courage is unques-
tioned.
His trouble this year will
be the defection of the
leftists, including the Liberal
Party. There is a leftist Dem-
ocrat running against him
in the primary.
Organized labor is cold to-
ward Donovan because of his
Independent voting record.
But both the Democratic and
Republican organizations
have announced their sup-
port.
Marcantonio has already
started to scream "McCar-
thyism" at Donovan. This
may gain him some support
from the Communist element
and, curiously, from some al-
legedly conservative Park
Avenue people. But among
vast numbers of the people
in that district, the name Mc-
Carthy is still something to
conjure with.
Perhaps that is because
they have lived near Com-
munists and favor anyone
who takes up the cudgel
against them.
And so the 18th will be
or.e district where no one can
complain about apathy this
fall.
