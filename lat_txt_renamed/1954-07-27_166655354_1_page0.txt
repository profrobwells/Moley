When two intelligent and conservative men like Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey and Sen. Byrd differ fundamentally about a matter of financial policy, it is not strange that the layman is confused about what is happening to his tax dollars.
And, incidentally, both of these gentlemen have the confidence and admiration of the President. For both were offered the job of Treasury Secretary. The latter refused and the former accepted.
A year ago the Secretary asked that the debt limit of $275,000,000,000 be raised. The Senator objected and Congress sustained him. Time proved the Senator to be right.
Now again the Secretary asks that the limit be raised, to $290,000,000,000, and the Senator objects once more. He points out that the Treasury on June 30 finished the year with an overhanging debt of $270,800,000,000, which leaves the Secretary more than $4,000,000,000 of space under the present ceiling. And the predicted deficit for the current fiscal year is to be $2,900,000,000.
It would seem to the observer that Byrd is right again. But still it is hard to accuse the Secretary either of ignorance or of an itch for profligate spending.
The difference in viewpoint is in the wholly uncertain amount that may be spent regardless of the most careful prognostications by Treasury experts. This uncertainty makes the whole concept of an annual budget unrealistic.
For if the Congress should vote all that the administration asked this year for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, the sum would be $56,300,000,000. But there is $86,900,000,000 in unexpended appropriations carried over from previous sessions of Congress. This, Sen. Byrd points out, means that there is hanging over the Treasury a potential, perhaps theoretical, expenditure of $143,200,000,000.
The Treasury must, through the information it gets from the various departments, anticipate pretty well how much of current appropriations will be spent and how much of the previous year's appropriations will be spent.
The guess, and it is little more than a guess, is that out of the appropriations for the present year $36,400,000,000 will be spent before July, 1955, and $29,200,000,000 of previous years' appropriations.
"The fact is," Byrd points out, "that about 50% of this year's expenditures do not appear in current appropriation bills. When we reduce an appropriation bill on the floor of the Senate we do not know whether we are reducing the expenditures for this year, or next year or two or three years in advance. Beyond this, more than $35,600,000,000 of appropriations on which Congress is acting this year are not for expenditures for the current year."
Moreover, the layman may not realize the difference between authorizations and appropriations.
In the present year the administration as well as Congress has been pretty profligate in recommending and passing authorizations which will morally obligate Congress in future years to make appropriations. The facts are not all before us yet, but it may well be that this administration, which is pledged to economy, will ultimately be a most expensive luxury.
Byrd proposes several remedies for this defective system of governmental finance. One would be to provide for a single appropriation bill so that members of both houses would be able to make comparative evaluations of the items they are appropriating. A resolution to require this has been sponsored by Byrd and has passed the Senate three times. It is still pending in the House.
Another recommendation would permit the President to veto specific items in the appropriation bills. This might require a constitutional amendment or possibly only a simple act of Congress.
This proposal has likewise been introduced and is pending in the Judiciary Committee.
For the present, the issue is whether Congress will raise the debt limit as the Treasury Secretary has requested. With Byrd in opposition and the figures seeming to support him, and an election in the offing, it is not likely that such a measure will pass.
