JORDAN
EPIC
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The primary in Idaho on
Aug. 10 no doubt attracted
national attention only be-
cause it marked the nomina-
tion by the Democrats of
Glen Taylor, the thesplan
politician who served a term
as U.S. Senator and ran with
Henry Wallace in 1948. But
beneath the account of his
return to public life is a solid
story told by the detailed fig-
ures of that primary. Those
statistics show that Taylor
won only because he was
supported by the same solid
core of malcontents that has
always supported him, and
that apathy generally pre-
vailed among other Demo-
crats.

Meanwhile, the Republican
primary vote outran all ex-
pectations. And so the most
conservative State in the
Northwest is not likely to
lose that distinction in No-
vember.

But the primary reminds
me that the end of this year
marks the retirement of one
of the most substantial and
attractive public figures that
I have known anywhere in
the West, Idaho's Gov. Len
Jordan. He cannot under the
law succeed himself and has
no desire to run for any oth-
er office.

*

Jordan's life has been
marked by many hardships,
but it has compensated him
with many rewards, the most
important of which is his
wife Grace, who in a most
remarkable way has written
the epic of her husband's
life and, with becoming mod-
esty, her own.

The story of their life to-
gether, "Home Below Hell's
Canyon," published this year,
is not only an absorbing per-
sonal narrative of venture-
some living but it is a lesson
for all who ask whether
Americans have lost the hab-
it of government help.

The Jordans, in the dark
months of 1933, moved with
their three children into the
indescribably rugged and al-
most inaccessible country
along the Snake River below
the deepest scar on the North
American continent, Hell's
Canyon.

*

It was a country as demand-
ing, adverse, and yet as re-
warding as any that has been
settled since the Pilgrims
landed. The Jordans were
visited only occasionally by
a mail boat that navigated
the unruly Snake River with
what few supplies they were
able to afford from the world
outside.

Mrs. Jordan tells the heart-
warming story of their "de-
termined frugality" and of
how when their first Christ-
mas in the new home arrived
they achieved with great re-
sourcefulness a happy occa-
sion for their children.

She gets across with rare
literary talent and utter lack
of forced dramatics or self-
pity the excitement and trib-
ulations of their existence.
While Len labored through
the years, managing their
herds of sheep, improving the
stock, planning for the shear-
ing, and contriving ways of
getting the product to mar-
ket, Grace shouldered the
heavy responsibilities of
teaching the children, cook-
ing for the family and the
ranch hands, canning food for
winter, and guarding the
health of all concerned.

*

Len Jordan knew all too
well that his way could not be
eased by any subsidies from
the government. And those
who know him realize that,
even if such help were avail-
able, he would rather make
his way unaided.

The fact that the voters of
his State in a surprise verdict
nominated and elected him
Governor four years ago is a
tribute not only to his sturdy
personal qualities but to the
people of that State.

It also throws light upon
the fact that throughout the
three years of controversy
over the now famous Hell's
Canyon dam, the State has
without wavering stood
against making the Valley of
the Snake a Federal province
and in favor of its develop-
ment for and by local inter-
ests.

The Jordan story is a re-
minder that this country will
never lack frontiers to win
so long as it has people with
the qualities needed to dis-
cover them.
