FROM COLD TO TEPID
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If as seems fairly likely at
this writing the two State
conventions in New York
State nominate Sen. Irving
M. Ives and W. Averell Har-
riman for Dewey's job as
Governor the political tem-
perature of the ensuing cam-
paign will fluctuate from cold
to tepid. For there is nothing
in the personalities of these
men to quicken marching
feet, unleash lusty lungs or
start fist fights.
The Democratic bosses in
New York City have decided
upon Harriman for reasons
that at first seem to be in-
comprehensible because it is
undeniable that F.D.R. Jr.
would be a stronger and more
colorful candidate.
The bosses say publicly
that they believe Harriman
to be the stronger. That, like
other public explanations of
bosses, is not true. What they
fear is that Junior would be
uncontrollable, unreliable and
overambitious.
Their memory no doubt
goes back to the days of Jun-
ior's father when he made
progress over the nation by
beating Tammany with heavy
blows and bitter words.
★
Moreover, these bosses
have watched Junior concen-
trating on the up-State De-
mocracy and they fear the
rivalry of Albany's Boss
O'Connell. They also have in
mind that Dewey's with-
drawal brightens Democratic
chances and that they may
win with a weaker and more
amenable candidate.
The best candidate of all
would be James A. Farley but
it is unlikely that he would
get the nomination.
Ives is a quiet studious man
who toiled for several years
in the State Legislature ris-
ing to the positions of ma-
jority leader and Speaker of
the Assembly. He is best
known as the author of the
antidiscrimination law which
made him many votes in New
York City.
★
He served for a time as
dean of the School of Indus-
trial Relations at Cornell. In
the Senate he has been some-
what more sympathetic to-
ward the unions than most
of his Republican colleagues.
Organized labor in New
York would be mildly sympa-
thetic toward his candidacy.
He is an uninspiring cam-
paigner and is not likely to
come up with original or
striking ideas.
Harriman by word and ac-
tion for over 15 years has
sought to shake off the dis-
tinction but not the emolu-
ments conferred upon him as
the son and heir of the fa-
mous railroad leader E. H.
Harriman.
In so doing Harriman has
shaken off the companion-
ship of most of the people
with whom he associated be-
fore he saw the great light of
the Roosevelt crusade. His
closest friend in Roosevelt
days was Harry Hopkins who
opened for him the gates to
such splendiferous posts as
Ambassador to the Soviet
Union and later to the Court
of St. James.
★
Under the powerful spon-
sorship of Hopkins he walked
and talked with the great
F.D.R., Churchill, De Gaulle,
Stalin, Marshall, Eden, Ache-
son and Wallace.
The CIO is a favored group
for his ultraliberal oratory.
But somehow, no matter how
hard he may try, his denun-
ciations of the business world
in which he grew up lack the
spontaneous virulence of the
Humphreys, Morses and Reu-
thers. The true tone of the
poor man's friend somehow
fails to emanate from this
child of fortune.
And so it looks like dull
days and a light vote in New
York.
