BIRD'S EYE
TOUR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
During his stay in Colorado
the President enjoyed a per-
sonally conducted tour by air
over the great area which
was the subject of the tre-
mendous but unsuccessful
fight in the recent session
of Congress to authorize the
so-called Upper Basin Stor-
age and Irrigation Project.
The trip, according to the As-
sociated Press, was to get "a
bird's-eye look at vast recla-
mation projects."
The President's guides were
Secretaries McKay and Ben-
son and certain unnamed "rec-
lamation officials."
No doubt these bureau peo-
ple, as well as Secretary
McKay, were anxious to win
Presidential interest in cer-
tain schemes which they have
in mind and which Congress
seems reluctant to approve.
At any rate, it may be of
interest to follow this tour
with the mind's eye and to
offer a few facts which the
President's guides probably
failed to give him.
*
The tour passed over the
city of. Pueblo, which hopes
to get great economic advan-
tages from the Fryingpan
Project which was beaten in
the House this summer. But
the plane flew over the place
in the high Rockies where it
is proposed to channel some
of the water on the west
slope and dump it into the
Arkansas on the east slope.
This would, according to
the Associated Press report,
relieve the "drought-plagued"
people in Eastern Colorado.
It is unfortunate that there
could not have been at the
President's side at that mo-
ment a lawyer from Granby,
Colo., who is undoubtedly the
best-informed person on irri-
gation on the west slope, who
told me in his office this sum-
mer that the contemplated
Fryingpan Project would be-
stow upon every acre of the
eastern slope a subsidy from
the Treasury of $1500. The
land would be worth at most
about $250 an acre after irri-
gation.
Then the travelers passed
over the Dinosaur area, in the
proposed $1,600,000,000 Upper
Colorado project (not $1,000,-
000,000 as the AP had it).
The President should have
been told that the Reclama-
tion Bureau made an egre-
gious error in calculating the
advantages of a dam in Dino-
saur which was not revealed
until some nature lovers
pointed it out.
He should have been told
also that the Upper Colorado
Project included irrigation
features which would require
subsidies of from $500 to $2750
per acre.
*
But the course went on to
Casper, Wyo. On the way
they should have detoured a
short distance to look at the
Riverton Project of the Rec-
lamation Bureau. This is one
of the most dismal of the
many failures of the bureau.
It was estimated to cost
$6,777,000, and to date it has
cost $29,897,000. And despite
the continued evidence of
failure over a period of 34
years, good money is still
going into it.
The plane could easily have
flown over the Shoshone Proj-
ect in Wyoming, some parts
of which, according to official
records, will not be entirely
liquidated for 2235 years.
In a short space of time the
travelers could have seen the
Milk River Project in Mon-
tana, 83% of which will be
paid off in 124 years. Then
there might be the Bitter
Root Project, which after
nearly 50 years still has two
centuries to go before the tax-
payers get their money back.

The last stop on the trip
was at McCook, Neb. The
President said there that he
received inspiration "from
people who are paying the
taxes." I doubt that he got
the taxpayers' view from his
companions in the plane —
unless from Secretary Ben-
son.
If the Secretary of Agricul-
ture had been asked, he
might have told the President
that opening new land to ir-
rigation will produce food
that we shall not, according
to official estimates, need in
our lifetime. For we shall be
in the lifetime of most of us
paying subsidies on food that
we do not need from land al-
ready in cultivation. But the
Secretary of Agriculture could
hardly have had the heart to
impair the joy of a pleasant
afternoon.
