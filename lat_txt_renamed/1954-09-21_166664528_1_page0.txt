POLITICAL
COMEDY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It was costly political comedy for the Senate to create
the Watkins committee.
Nothing shows that so
clearly as a news story saying that Sen. McCarthy will
spend the time between now
and the session beginning in
January preparing to defend
himself on the Senate floor.
This points to the extension
of this wry affair into another
year, into another session, at
the expense of a nation whose
business has already been
neglected by its chosen servants in Congress.
There are not likely to be
any new disclosures, any new
personalities, any new evidence — just the same old
silly, dreary routine.
*
Was it legally or morally
or otherwise wrong for McCarthy to take the Lustron
money to write a pamphlet?
Just how strong may the language of a Senator be in addressing a general? Has Gen.
Zwicker been injured seriously by the treatment he received? Can a Senator make
puns on another Senator’s
name or say he is senile or
stupid? Was Cohn a fresh
young man?
There is the mooted question whether the President
can control or prevent the
telling of private conversations between Army officers
or the giving of material to
a Senator by a bureaucrat.
The authorities are wholly
at sea about the latter and
from my own knowledge of
the cogitations of lawyers and
judges and political scientists,
they will still be at sea in
January, 1956, or 1966 or 1976.
And what does a vote of censure mean? Will the anti-
McCarthyites or the pro-McCarthyites think any more or
less of the Senator from Wisconsin after a vote than now?
These are only a few of the
matters on which valuable
time will be spent next year
while billions of expenditures
need careful examination and
the world outside is burning
in the flames of undeclared
war.
*
There is also the matter of
the immobilization of the important Committee on Government Operations, of which
McCarthy is the chairman.
Whether we like him or not,
his committee is charged
with a serious job not only
in rooting out Communists
but in surveying government
departments generally to root
out waste and corruption. It
has done no real work for
many months. If this wretched matter must go over to
January, it will probably complete a year of inaction. This
is inexcusable neglect of public business.
The creation of the Watkins
committee before the report
of the Mundt committee had
been submitted in a practical
way put the Senate in contempt of itself. The Watkins
committee has been rehashing the work not only of the
Mundt committee but of other committees of two or three
or four years ago. What is
to prevent two or three irreconcilable Senators, supported
by the collective fears of the
Senators generally, from creating a committee to rehash
the Watkins committee? Is
the Senate, never to be ready
by solemn Yes and No vote
to end this display?
*
The motion to censure
should have been voted up
or down when it was offered.
Everybody knows that the
reason it was turned over to
a committee was the fear of
Senators to stand up and be
counted. The various charges
were not mysterious or complicated. Any man of normal
intelligence could have taken
them home overnight and
after a few hours of thought
could have voted his convictions on them. There was no
need for laborious research
or argument. In fact, I do
not doubt that every Senator
knew then and knows now
his own opinion of these
charges.
The time wasted on the
whole affair to date cannot
be recovered. The folly of it
all cannot be erased. But
there is a way to get it settled before serious business
begins in January. Let the
Senate come back after the
election in November and get
this thing cleared and out of
the way.
