A TIMELY
REMINDER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

There could have been no
better time or place for the
sharp reminder by Secretary
of Labor Mitchell that the
leaders of the AFL should
be fair rather than partisan
than at the moment he se-
lected and at Los Angeles.
For he was speaking four
days before the appearance
of the President in that city
and in a State where the
pretensions and the blind
partisanship of labor leaders
have been especially note-
worthy.

*

In August I was in Santa
Barbara during the State
convention of the AFL, and
the sessions took on not the
tone and temper of a serious
group of representatives of
workingmen, but rather
those of a rabid group of
partisans. Leaders not only
of the AFL but of the CIO
have given to their conven-
tions in recent years all the
tawdry trimmings of a party
nominating convention.
And while the American
public has learned to discount
the lack of sincerity in party
gatherings, it has a right to
expect something better from
people who are supposed to
represent the just and con-
sidered interests of an eco-
nomic group. For if the two
great labor organizations are
to be nothing but branches
of the presently left-wing-
controlled Democratic Party,
they might well make the
merger complete and permit
other and newly created or-
ganizations to represent the
special and important econom-
ic interests of the working-
man.

George Meany, smarting
over the reproof administered
by Secretary Mitchell, takes
refuge in the sanctuary so
often resorted to when ra-
tional answers fail. He ac-
cuses the Labor Secretary of
discourtesy to his hosts. How
about the treatment given
the Vice-President last year
when he appeared at St.
Louis? It has taken either a
hardy or a double-talking, Re-
publican in recent years to
speak at a labor convention.
Courtesy is a two-way street.
It may well be that events
in the State of California
have given labor leaders en-
larged ideas of their impor-
tance and that those leaders
can, by denunciations, make
the Republican Party as sub-
missive as the Democratic
Party has been. For Gov.
Goodwin Knight has aston-
ished many of his conserva-
tive friends by the manner
in which he has gone over-
board in favor of the specif-
ic demands of labor.

In seeking the endorsement
of the AFL (which he re-
ceived), he specifically prom-
ised, in referring to "right-
to-work legislation," "hot car-
go," and "secondary boycott"
legislation, to "work to defeat
it in the Legislature," to veto
it if passed and to oppose it
if placed on the ballot. He
continued with a promise to
oppose "restrictive legisla-
tion aimed at labor."
This latter is a promise
quite different from being
fair to labor. It means that
labor shall have no restric-
tions, which means no regu-
lation. That means that la-
bor, so far as the future is
concerned, is to be free and
uncontrolled. If, for example
I am to be "unrestricted,"
then I am above the law and
the government.
Gov. Warren, regarded as
an ultraliberal Republican
never made such promises.
Nor, in fact, should any can-
didate for elective office make
such promises.

Meanwhile, the great pow-
er of the labor bosses is being
leveled at a few California
Congressmen who well de-
serve re-election. Knight's
submissiveness has made
their position even more pre-
carious.
The Eisenhower adminis-
tration will win the votes of
countless card-carrying union
members if it fully support
the strictures of Secretary
Mitchell. For there is a moun-
tain of evidence that the ar-
rogance of some leaders has
violated the sense of fair play
of their members. It was the
invasion of Texas by the CIO
that assured the renomina-
tion of Gov. Shivers. The late
Sen. Taft administered a
sound lesson to such leaders
in 1950.
For in the last analysis,
workingmen are citizens, not
pawns in the hands of labor
bosses.
