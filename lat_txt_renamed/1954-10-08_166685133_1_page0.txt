THE FRAIL
PROPHETS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If you still believe in the
cliche, "consensus of ex-
perts," think of the late
and, to this native of Cleve-
land, deplorable World
Series. For human nature
and what superstitious peo-
ple call "the breaks" proved
the "consensus" wrong on
a relatively simple matter.
I make this suggestion
because at this season the
political soothsayers who
were so wrong exactly six
years ago are at it again.
They are offering a "consen-
sus" about a matter infinite-
ly more complex than the
relative strength of two
groups of hired hands in
the game of baseball.
Perhaps they are count-
ing on the so-called statute
of limitations, which with
regard to some sorts of legal
actions draws the line at a
period around six years.
The old English law fixed
it at six years for contracts
and four for torts. Perhaps
the prophets feel that what
they did six years ago
should not be held against
them now and that they are
safe to risk their rather tat-
tered reputations again.

This is not to say that I
am suggesting that the
Democratic Party will not
organize the coming Con-
gress. I am not predicting
anything. I am merely say-
ing that years of experience
have taught me not to pre-
dict at all.
Nor am I criticizing the
prophets. They are, like all
of us, made of frail human
flesh, and the insensate cu-
riosity of their reading pub-
lic demands satisfaction.
And frail human flesh re-
quires something to live on.
But before we conclude
that any specific result is
imminent, let us consider a
number of factors that im-
pair any effort at this time
to get accurate information.
I say "at this time" because
experience has taught me
that a great deal that is re-
liable can be learned by a
careful checking with ex-
perienced political report-
ers about a week before
election. Even then, expert
must be checked against
expert, and the expert's
special weaknesses must be
known and weighed.

One of the dangers at
present is that the candi-
dates who have been mak-
ing the most noise are gen-
erally overrated.
Take the State of Oregon
as an example. The quiet,
industrious Sen. Cordon is
opposed by the extremely
active and voluble Richard
Neuberger. Months ago I
was told in Oregon that
Neuberger was "making
great progress." I also was
told by other people that
Cordon was better known,
the sort that the solid citi-
zens of the State like, and
that when people had a
chance to think things over
Cordon would be preferred.
Thus you have two con-
flicting advantages - noisy
campaigning by Neuberger
over a long period of time,
versus long acquaintance
with the name Cordon
through the newspapers
and by personal contacts of
various sorts. Who can
weigh one of these advan-
tages against the other?

It should be noted also
that the same condition pre-
vails in Idaho, which, ac-
cording to newspapers 2500
miles from the scene, is go-
ing to elect the clownish
Glen Taylor over the some-
what inarticulate Sen.
Dworshak. Can anyone
weigh the relative political
strength of these two? Or
the relative strength of Sen.
James E. Murray and Rep.
Wesley D'Ewart, both of
whom are well known and
both of whom were busy
in Washington until the end
of the session?
Perhaps a good guess
could be made about New
Jersey, where there is out-
right internecine warfare
within the Republican
Party, plus a succession of
newly revealed Republican
scandals to hamper the Re-
publican candidate. There
is also Kentucky where,
barring the ravages of age,
there is nothing likely to
beat the venerable Barkley.
Except for these possible,
even probable changes in
party representation, no
other shifts seem to war-
rant prediction at this writ-
ing. In two more weeks the
picture will probably clear
up. But there are no seers
whom I know to penetrate
the clouds that now ob-
scure the portents.
