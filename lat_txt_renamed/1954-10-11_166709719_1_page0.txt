BEVAN'S
FIGHT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Apparently only where
hatred of the United States
is concerned can there be
harmony in the British La-
bor Party. In the recent
trip by leaders of that par-
ty to Russia, Red China
and India there seemed to
be complete agreement be-
tween former Prime Minis-
ter Attlee and Aneurin'
Bevan. But once back on
English soil and in solemn
party conclave at Scarbor-
ough, the old rivalry broke
forth in violent speech and
action.
Attlee and Herbert Mor-
rison favored and carried
through the conference a
vote favoring the rearma-
ment of Germany. They
also won on other proposals
aimed at agreement with
the Conservatives on some
aspects of foreign policy.
*
Bevan, despite all his elo-
quence, was thoroughly
beaten and, to make his hu-
miliation complete, was de-
feated in a bid for the office
of party treasurer by Hugh
Gaitskell. Especially notable
in recent events relating to
Bevan was the opposition to
him by the leaders of some
of the major trade unions.
And so, with the great
skill which has carried him
so far, Bevan staged a meet-
ing at which he was cast at
once as a martyr and a
rebel angel. He said that
he felt "a sense of emanci-
pation."
Now he would be a lone
figure, carrying his message
over the heads of Attlee
and Co., and especially over
the heads of the leaders of
the unions who had op-
posed him. Like all frus-
trated Socialists, he took
refuge in a call for further
"education" of the workers
themselves. As if the "edu-
cation" of which he speaks
has not been going on since
the formation of the Fabian
Society 70 years ago!
What Bevan is pleading
for is "time" in foreign af-
fairs. He would, if he
could, divide the western
nations, slow down arma-
ment, and keep Germany
helpless in the sublime
faith that the leaders of
the Soviet would change
character and become de-
pendable friends.
*
At home he would real-
ize the ultimate Marxist so-
ciety shaped according to
his interpretation of it.
And to do this he will
now, he says, go out and
win the rank and file of
workers over from their
present leaders. It will be
unrestricted warfare against
the present leaders of the
party and of the trade un-
ions. This is no mean
threat. Bevan, in his 50s,
is considerably younger
than those whom he op-
poses. He is more vigorous
and more of a demagogue.
Moreover, as he shows on
every page of his book, "In
Place of Fear," published in
1952, he is burning with two
passions. One is hatred of
the old order in Brit-
ain and everything that
suggests it. The other is a
lust for power.
Bevan says that when he
first entered the House of
Parliament, all that was
pageantry, the traditions,
the customs and rules were
not of his world or that of
his ancestors. The ameni-
ties of public life were "an
elaborate conspiracy to pre-
vent the real clash of opin-
ion which exists outside."
*
When he first spoke, it
was with a fierce wish to
shock, not to convince.
Hence his contempt for or-
derly procedure. For con-
servatism he had only
hatred; for liberalism, con-
tempt.
He says that as "a young
miner in a South Wales
colliery my concern was
with the one practical ques-
tion: Where does power lie
in this particular state of
Britain and how can it be
attained by the workers?
It was no abstract question
for us. The circumstances
of our lives made it a burn-
ing, luminous mark of in-
terrogation. Where was
power and which is the
road to it?"
That, three decades later,
is what is driving him on.
For when he says "work-
ers" he means the inspired,
self-anointed spokesman for
the workers, Nye Bevan.
A man like that cannot
be written off with one de-
feat. He can, like Samson,
destroy himself, but also
like Samson he will destroy
much besides.
