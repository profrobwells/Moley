IF THE OUTS
GET IN---
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

I wish to make clear that
what follows is not based
upon any conviction of my
own that the Democratic
Party will win control of
Congress in the coming
election. I have made it
clear in previous columns
that I do not know who
will win and that I do not
know anyone who does
know. It is, however, legitimate
to speculate upon
what is likely to prevail if
the Democrats win.

★

The other day I discussed
this question with a very
conservative Republican
Congressman who anticipates
no trouble in his own
re-election. He said:

"I am not predicting a
Democratic victory next
month. I do not know who
will win. But if the Democrats
take over control of
the next Congress, the position
of a considerable number
of Republican Congressmen
and Senators will involve
less tension and
strain than they have been
under during the last two
years.

"There will be fewer roll
calls in which loyalty to the
President is involved. The
Democrats will be asking
for votes, rather than the
Republican leadership. Consequently,
the Republicans
will vote more largely their
fundamental convictions,
and the conservative ones
will find themselves allied
with the conservatives on
the Democratic side.

"In other words, the conservative
coalition will
again be the dominant force
in Congress."

★

This gentleman did not
say so, but I am sure that
he meant that on a great
many issues he will under
such circumstances be able
to express himself more
freely and to vote more as
he wishes than in the 83rd
Congress.

To be specific, I wish to
cite a vote in the Interior
and Insular Affairs Committee
in the House, on the
Upper Colorado Project, one
of the most expensive reclamation
projects ever to
come before Congress. It
was approved by a 13-12
vote.

I have the best of reasons
to believe that this vote
would have been reversed
except for the fact that the
President had favored the
project and it was made an
administration issue.

★

At least one and perhaps
more of the Republicans
who voted for it were not
expressing their true opinion
of the worth of the project
but their desire to go
along with Eisenhower and
McKay, who had staked
their leadership on the
measure.

When the same measure
came before the Senate
committee, Republican
members added more than
$500,000,000 to it and
jammed it through.

While several members
were really voting the selfish
interests of their constituents,
they were convinced
in their own minds
that it was in many respects
an indefensible measure.
However, the President's
sponsorship of it, together
with the self-interests of
their States and the imminence
of the election,
swayed their vote.

★

The same was true in
several other measures in
which the administration,
on the rather dubious
ground that it was pursuing
a "middle-of-the-road"
course, was sponsoring essentially
Fair Deal measures.
Many conservative
Republicans gagged but
voted with the administration.
There need be no
gagging of that sort if the
Democratic Party takes
over.

Moreover, it will be an
ironical turn for radical
Democrats if their party
wins. For the restoration of
the coalition will take from
them all the essential fruits
of their victory. The Humphreys
and Morses will find
themselves possessed of an
empty triumph.
