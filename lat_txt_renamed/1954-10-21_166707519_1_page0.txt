IN NEW YORK BY RAYMOND MOLEY

NEW YORK — About the
only political poll which I
have in the past found to
be genuinely valuable is the
one conducted by the New
York Daily News. It limits
itself to elections in the
State and city of New York,
and it shows evidence
of thoroughness, experience
and knowhow.

It is now conducting a
preference poll on Harri-
man and Ives, the Demo-
cratic and Republican can-
didates for Governor. Har-
riman is regarded by good
political observers as a
weak candidate. In fact, it
was widely rumored among
Democratic politicians that
F. D. R. Jr. was sidetracked
in favor of Harriman be-
cause the bosses did not
expect to win in any event.
Certainly, Harriman is an
uninspiring candidate and
has few of the qualities that
might serve the State as
Governor.

But he is, in the news
poll, running well ahead of
Ives, a proven vote-getter
backed by Dewey, a power-
ful figure in New York.
But it is in the details of
the news poll rather than
in the over-all percentages
where signs ominous to the
Republicans appear. For
Ives seems to be running
very well upstate. In some
places he is doing better
than Dewey in 1950. In this
straw poll he carried
Rochester, which Dewey
lost in 1950.

But in New York City
the Ives vote seems to be
falling away disastrously
from the normal Republi-
can share. In Democratic
districts where Dewey or-
dinarily got a fair share,
Ives is very far behind.
Most important is the
change in four Assembly
districts in Queens. That
borough has been Republi-
can for several years. All
those districts went to Dew-
ey in 1950 by large majori-
ties. This year Harriman
seems to be ahead by a
larger margin than that of
Dewey four years ago. That
is really significant.

It must be taken into con-
sideration that registration
was down by 10 to 15% in
New York City. A fair in-
ference from this reduction
in registration, together
with what is shown in the
poll, is that the people who
neglected to register were
predominantly voting Re-
publican in 1950 and 1952.
Something has affected the
attitude of these people.
At this point I should add
that I have attempted to
learn from Republican
workers what motives are
behind this change in atti-
tude. The major motive is
resentment against the
Eisenhower administration.
Most important is bitterness
over the McCarthy issue. It
is felt that he is being per-
secuted and that the admin-
istration is to blame.

It should be added that
this is not solely a senti-
ment limited to members of
the Catholic faith and of
Irish ancestry. It prevails
among Italians and Negroes,
some of whom are normal-
ly Republican. It also ex-
tends into other sections of
the population.

New York City opinion is
never clearly represented in
Park Avenue circles or in
certain metropolitan news-
papers. It is more clearly
represented where there
are the most votes—in the
clubhouses and the social
organizations and the sa-
loons in the various Assem-
bly districts.

Among real Republican
workers in those club-
houses there is another
serious gripe. People who
labored to get out the vote
in 1952 expected to be re-
warded with some patron-
age. There has been bitter
disappointment in that de-
partment. In short, those
regulars do not believe that
Eisenhower is a real Repub-
lican.

The "issues" being dis-
cussed over the nation by
Messrs. Stevenson, Truman
and other Democratic lead-
ers have little influence in
New York City. Talk of
unemployment leaves peo-
ple cold. The power issue
is ignored. Federal hous-
ing has long since ceased to
be a matter of interest.
It is dissatisfaction and
disillusionment in
the Eisenhower administra-
tion and dislike of his ad-
visers that may well deter-
mine the result in New
York State.
