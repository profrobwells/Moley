It has long been recog-
nized by those who would
jealously guard the integri-
ty of our judiciary not only
that there must be fair and
impartial administration of
the law but that within rea-
sonable limits it must also
seem to be fair and impar-
tial to the generality of the
lay public.
This is not to say that
judges should sway with
the winds of popular opin-
ion. But it is to say that
all officers of the courts,
judges, government attor-
neys and lawyers should
seek to provide not only the
substance but the appear-
ance of justice. And those
of us who write for public
consumption should have a
sense of adding to, rather
than taking from, public re-
spect for the courts.
But in the Lattimore
case Judge Luther W.
Youngdahl has fallen far
short of his duty to provide
a basis for public confidence
in the trial and its outcome.
His unseeming stubborn-
ness may well mean that a
public verdict will be ren-
dered which may even be
unfair to Lattimore himself.
The judge should realize
that he is not on trial. It
is Lattimore who is on trial,
and, with him, the fair
name of American justice.
In his intemperate reply
to the demand of the U.S.
Attorney that he disquali-
fy himself Judge Young-
dahl reveals the very bent
with which he is charged.
Nor does his argument add
luster to his standing as a
jurist. Among other things
he says:
"The government ap-
pealed from my rulings and
our Court, of Appeals, sit-
ting en banc, reviewed
them. Eight of our nine
distinguished appellate
judges sustained me in dis-
missing the most vital count
in the indictment. Four of
the nine judges were for
sustaining my action in
toto. There is nothing, and
the present affidavit makes
no claim that there is any-
thing, in any of the views
expressed by any of our
nine appellate judges that
gives the slightest color to
the charge of bias against
me."
Thus, on only one of the
counts which Youngdahl
dismissed was he sustained
by eight of the nine appel-
late judges who reviewed
his findings. A minority
went along with his entire
findings, and none of the
appellate judges held him
to be guilty of bias.
Since the issue which
they were to decide was
not that of bias, this excuse
is meaningless. This is
pretty flimsy stuff to be
used as a defense.
But the lay public will
look beyond this case and
the issues of bias to the rec-
ord of the judge himself.
It was freely stated and
it seems to be a fair infer-
ence that Youngdahl's ap-
pointment to the bench was
heavily laden with politics.
He was a Republican Gov-
ernor deeply indebted to
the Republican Party and
to Harold Stassen for his
elevation to the Governor-
ship of Minnesota.
Suddenly, either with the
recommendation, or at any
rate with the approval of
Hubert Humphrey, Demo-
cratic Senator, Youngdahl
was appointed by a Demo-
cratic President to the
bench. This cleared the
way for Humphrey to suc-
ceed himself in 1954.
This sort of maneuver
can hardly be ascribed to
coincidence. It strongly sug-
gests the play of very prac-
tical politics and self-inter-
est. This record will be as-
sayed by a critical public,
despite the fact that it has
no technical connection
with the Lattimore case.
The plain fact is that the
public will be utterly cyni-
cal about the whole case un-
less the judge on second
thought decides that pub-
lic confidence in the judicial
process is more important
than his own pride.
