RAYMOND MOLEY:
President Must Seek
to Build Party Unity
The election shows an
over-all trend in the country,
with some soft spots.
That sounds like the economic
portents. Generally
prosperous, with some slow
pockets.
If the President sticks to
the right of center, as he
has to a degree in the past,
he can get co-operation
from this Congress, regardless
of its party balance.
But if, following some of
his leftist advisers, he feels
that this is a mandate for
more welfarism and more
Federal centralization, he
will not only have trouble
with Congress but will seriously
imperil the unity of
his own party and lay the
basis for bitter conflict in
the two years ahead.
*
In short, he cannot be
half Paul Hoffman and half
Everett Dirksen and hope
to win full allegiance from
the rank and file of his party.
The discontent that lost
so many Governorships and
destroyed Republican control
of the House this time
was very deep and very
strong. It will grow if the
White House palace guard
prevails in the future as in
the past.
If, after a close examination
of sentiment on the
voting level, anything can
be said with certainty, the
Republican disasters in the
Northeast were due to voter
antagonism to what was
regarded as the President's
preference for the left-wing
internationalist side of his
party. It was that element
that suffered the most severe
defeats.
*
The defeat in Pennsylvania
came from a condition
which I saw clearly in
three visits to that State
last spring.
There were many loyal
party workers, including
members of a marvelous
women's organization, who
made no bones about their
resentment against the
State machine headed by
Gov. Fine, about their unhappiness
with what one
worker called the "lukewarm"
Republicanism of
the White House advisers,
and about their complaints
over the scanty supply of
jobs supplied by Washington.
I am surprised that the
loss of Republican House
seats was not greater.
*
Without trying to fit all
the facts into my general
contention, it is only reasonable
to explain the victory of
Sen. Douglas by several factors
other than discontent
with the conservative measures
sponsored by the administration.
Douglas has been a Senator
for six years and is well
known in the State. He is
unquestionably a highly
personable man with wide
knowledge of national affairs.
Unquestionable also is
the fact that Southern Illinois
is one of the distress
areas in the employment
scene.
Meek is not well known.
He is not convincing in his
grasp of national affairs.
And what is most important,
he tried without success
to compromise his
strong conservative instincts
to fit the Eisenhower
program.
*
In many States McCarthy
adherents were so angry
that they refused to vote in
great numbers. I can tell
that from my own correspondence
and from my personal
contacts with voters.
Over all, the more radical
candidates went down to
defeat in the Mountain
States and on the Pacific
Coast.
Finally, it must be admitted
that the policies of the
able, forthright and conservative
Secretary Benson
lost the party no serious
ground. This is a fact for
the President to ponder
deeply as he decides what
course to follow in the two
years ahead.
