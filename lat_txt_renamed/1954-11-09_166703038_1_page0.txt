ONE WAY
OUT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Senate side of the
83rd Congress has the op-
portunity to win the thanks
of millions by taking a short
and sensible course in rid-
ding itself and the much-
burdened American public
of the case of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin.
My own suggestion, with
which I believe most Amer-
icans will devoutly sympa-
thize, is to end the matter
at once by dismissing the
Watkins committee with
due thanks. Then the Sen-
ators and all the rest of us
can get back to more im-
portant business.
The election itself and
its results all point to this
as a way out.
*
In the first place the con-
trol of the Senate will, in all
probability, change hands
when it reconvenes in 1955.
That will remove Sen. Mc-
Carthy from his chairman-
ship and put Sen. McClel-
lan in his place.
Next, Sen. Gillette has
been defeated and it was an
alleged affront to his com-
mittee that constituted one
of the two charges which
are the basis of the matter
before the Senate.
The 83rd Congress is, ex-
cept for this post-mortem
session, a matter of history.
The alleged insult to the
Gillette committee goes
back to still another Con-
gress that is a matter of
history.
Finally, an important
member of the Gillette com-
mittee, Sen. Hendrickson,
will leave the Senate and he
may be willing to square
matters with a handshake of
farewell and a simple apolo-
gy from Sen. McCarthy. For
if anyone was the victim of
the McCarthy bad manners
it was the inoffensive gen-
tleman from New Jersey.
★
What McCarthy said
about Hendrickson was
rude and indefensible—
much, much worse than the
remarks to Gen. Zwicker.
If he is willing to accept an
honorable termination of
the whole business, every-
one else should be, too.
To say the most, the at-
titude of McCarthy toward
the Gillette committee was
capable of more than one
interpretation, and a good
case could be made for Mc-
Carthy's contention that he
showed no really contemp-
tuous attitude toward that
committee.
In any event, the commit-
tee offended made no move
at the time to bring a cen-
sure action against McCar-
thy.
The argument on this
could go on for weeks, to
the disgust and dismay of
every rational citizen in the
United States.
The dignity of the Sen-
ate would suffer more from
such an exhibition than to
let an alleged affront to one
of its past committees go
unpunished.
★
In the Zwicker case, which
is the basis of the second
charge, McCarthy himself
could offer an apology for
hasty and intemperate lan-
guage. Surely the general
has suffered no irreparable
harm.
And so I suggest to the
responsible leaders of the
Senate and to McCarthy
himself that they will win
the everlasting gratitude of
millions if they will end the
matter and let everybody
get back to work.
