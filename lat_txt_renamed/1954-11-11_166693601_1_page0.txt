A SERIOUS
LOSS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

As the Senate meets this
week to discuss the cen-
sure of Sen. McCarthy, note
it well. It is not the most
able or distinguished group
of statesmen who have sat
there. The loss of Taft and
McCarran was grievous.
But you will live to see its
distinction further watered
down. The date will be
January, 1955.
The shift of control from
the Republicans to the
Democrats is not so seri-
ous in its meaning to the
American citizen whom the
Senate is supposed to
serve. The greatest loss to
the Senate in this election
was the defeat of Guy Cor-
don and Homer Ferguson
in Michigan.
It takes time to build a
good Senator and there
must be something in the
beginning to work with.
Cordon and Ferguson were
able in their own right and
the nation had a large in-
vestment in their experi-
ence—covering 10 years in
the case of Cordon and 12
in that of Ferguson.

In Oregon this summer I
was discussing Cordon with
an old and admiring friend
of the Senator. He said he
always thought of a stanza
in Kipling's "Bobs" when
he was asked about Cordon:
Oh, 'e's little but he's wise,
E's a terror for 'is size,
An' 'e does not avertise.
Well, that was the trou-
ble. Cordon was incapable
of advertising himself.
People in Oregon who
know him well have been
fearful of the result ever
since the indefatigable
Richard Neuberger started
his campaign for the seat,
perhaps two or three years
ago.
One man said to me since
the election that Cordon
told him before he went
home to campaign that he
did not want to return to
the Senate.
I had been told in Oregon
that the belief was alto-
gether too prevalent in the
State that Cordon didn't
want the job. That was bad.
The voters like to be flat-
tered by the suggestion that
they have something pre-
cious to give.

People in Idaho said in
the summer that Glen Tay-
lor was going to get many
a vote merely by asking
for it. They could see no
other reason for voting for
him.
Cordon finished his Sen-
atorial labors, which were
very great in the 83rd Con-
gress, and then went home
to see what he could do
about campaigning. What
he was able to do was too
little and too late. Neuber-
ger had combed the State.
What was especially se-
rious was that Neuberger
during the campaign got all
the better of the newspaper
publicity.
Probably editors will re-
ply that Cordon is a very
hard man to make news
about.
But Cordon was a man
of notable stature. His mas-
tery of matters affecting
national resources and con-
servation was greater than
that of any other member
of the Senate.
★
In 1950 he took the Sen-
ate floor in opposition to a
piece of legislation promot-
ed by Sen. O'Mahoney, then
chairman of the Interior
Committee.
He was facing a Democra-
tic Senate majority, and he
was opposing a man who
was supposed to know rec-
lamation law. But he made
the point that the proposal
in question would materially
change that law, to the loss
of the taxpayers of the na-
tion.
For three days Cordon
held the floor and delivered
one of the finest speeches I
have ever read. It won a
majority in that Democratic
body, despite the vigorous
opposition of O'Mahoney
and other administration
stalwarts.
Cordon's management of
the tidelands bill saved that
legislation and redeemed
one of the most impor-
tant of the President's
pledges.
Such a man cannot be re-
placed for a long time. In
his seat there will be estab-
lished a man whose best
claim to fame is that he was
able to promote Wayne
Morse from junior to senior
Senator from Oregon.
