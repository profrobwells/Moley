A NATURAL
PARALLEL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It was bound to come, this
suggestion of the parallel
between the problems faced
by Eisenhower in the two
years to come and those of
Woodrow Wilson after the
change in party control in
the 1918 election.
There are similarities and
there are sharp differences.
But there is a serious re-
minder for us now in the
nation's experience in those
unhappy years from 1919
to 1921.
Wilson, like Eisenhower,
was denied a Congress of
his choice in the mid-term
of 1918. The balance in the
Senate was exactly what it
will be next January—49—
47 against the President.
Wilson, like Eisenhower,
was the idol of Europe, al-
though his popularity in the
United States was never
that enjoyed by the pres-
ent President.
★
When Wilson went to the
peace conference in late
1918, he was approaching
his 62nd birthday. Eisen-
hower was 64 in October.
It is significant to note
that the parallel ends when
we come to the matter of
character and tempera-
ment.
Wilson proved to be stern,
inflexible and capable of
lasting personal prejudices,
such as he revealed toward
Sen. Lodge.
Eisenhower, except for
occasional flashes of temper,
is the soul of good humor.
He is almost too concilia-
tory.
Wilson could not suffer
fools lightly. In fact, he
could not suffer them at all.
I would not suggest that
there are fools around our
President. But his toler-
ance extends to some rath-
er strange choices.
★
Perhaps under the stress
of the bitter attacks that are
sure to come from the radi-
cal Democrats as soon as
they detect any slipping in
the President's popularity,
the conflict will develop.
But it is more likely that
the President will compro-
mise too much rather than
too little. That will be just
as fatal to the building of a
strong Republican Party in
1956 as the Wilson inflexi-
bility proved to be.
For the left wing of the
Democratic Party will
pounce upon every sign of
weakness to press forward.
This time, unlike the
period before the late elec-
tion, nothing can be gained
for them by praising the
President. They are not out
just to win Congress now.
They are after the Presi-
dency. And they cannot win
that unless they destroy
Eisenhower.
All of the sentiment in
the Republican Party now
is intent upon the candi-
dacy of Eisenhower in 1956.
He is, in fact, their indis-
pensable man. His own in-
clination has not been dis-
closed. It is unlikely that
it will be disclosed for a
long time.
★
But without wishing un-
necessarily to disturb the
dreams of Republicans, it
should be suggested that
time has its way with all
things. Eisenhower will be
66 in 1956. He would be 70
before he finished his sec-
ond term if re-elected.
Will he in 1956 have the
physical attributes neces-
sary for the strain of an-
other term? A MacArthur,
of course, took over another
war in 1950, at the age of
70.
Churchill became Prime
Minister in 1940 at the age
of 66. But on the other side
of the picture appears the
failing health of Wilson at
63 and the unforgettable
tragedy of F. D. R. at 63.
Only the President him-
self can judge on which side
of this picture he is likely
to belong. And if there is
any doubt, he had best be-
gin to consider a successor.
He cannot depend upon
the leaders of his party to
decide this for him. They
will want him to run at
whatever personal risk it
may mean to him.
It didn't worry the Dem-
ocratic leaders in 1944 when
they knew almost to a
certainty that their candi-
date could not survive the
term for which they urged
him to run.
Politicians are not con-
cerned about the other fel-
low's health. The President
must protect himself.
