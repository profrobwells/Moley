THE ROCKY
ROAD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The meeting of the Senate
on the McCarthy
charges suggests a convocation
of gluttons considering
the punishment of a member
for eating too much.

If any vestige of humor
were left in that body,
someone would rise and
present a list of so many
charges against so many
Senators that the whole
thing would explode in a
roar of gusty laughter.

These people, including
Sen. McCarthy, are trying
to convince people that a
group of politicians who
came up the rocky road of
billingsgate, double talk,
slander and abuse can,
when sworn in as members
of a body designated
by the Constitution as the
Senate, turn themselves
into a body of dignified, sincere,
judicial and polite
statesmen.

That is asking an overly
credulous public just too
much.

While these men are of
us, chosen by us and represent
us, and are on average
better than most of us,
most of them have a long
career behind them of
rough-and-tumble campaigns
to get elected to
various offices.

Consider what that
means. Think of the impromptu
speeches on hot,
steamy mornings on Courthouse
steps before a scattering
of loafers mixed with
honest citizens.

That is no moment for
Chesterfieldian manners or
Burkian language. Things
have to be overstated or
they are lost in the murky
atmosphere of confusion.
There are always demands
for givemhell talk.
Harry S. Truman knew
that and won the Presidency
precisely that way.

Consider the evening
meetings in village halls
with a group of sniveling,
inattentive youngsters on
the front seats and a scattering
of citizens and their
wives in the rear â€” with
poor lighting, deplorable
ventilation, and noisy
echoes from the street and
slamming doors in the rear.
You go through all that if
you get to be a Senator.

Perhaps, after a long
time, when you get established
in the affections of
your State you can be dignified,
as was the great
Sen. Borah.

But two men of stature
tried that this year, and after
January they will be just
plain Guy Cordon and
Homer Ferguson. Campaigning
against them were
plenty of people who were
willing to wade through the
mire for the jobs.

Perhaps the language
which is being used will be
attributed to frayed tempers
and overstrain. But the
whole training of a politician
hardens him against
losing his temper.

Instead, he keeps his
temper but simulates anger,
just as a Garrick simulates
grief. It isn't anger
that provokes the strong
talk on both sides of this
messy affair. It is habit.
It is the innate nature of
people who have survived
in a political life in which
sensitive souls perish or
are driven away.

To understand what this
rather strong language of
mine means, read if you
will all of the Senate debate
on Aug. 2 last when Sen.
Flanders read the charges
prepared for him by the
Committee for a More Effective
Congress. McCarthy
was likened to Hitler
and at the same time he
was pictured as aiding the
Communist conspiracy.

Sen. Lehman in every
campaign compared his opponents
with Nazis as long
as that term was usable.

The Senate is getting itself
into a morass from
which it can never escape
unless it quickly resolves
this matter.

So long as we are what
we are, and as a consequence
Senators are what
they are, strong language
will be the order of the
day. Perhaps a motion is
in order to censure the
human race.
