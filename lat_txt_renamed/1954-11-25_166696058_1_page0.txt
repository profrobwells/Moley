Leftist writers, some of
whom claim to support
President Eisenhower, seem
to assume that Sen. Mc-
Carthy will cease to be an
important factor in the
mind of the public after this
censure session and the be-
ginning of the new Congress
in January. That assump-
tion may or may not prove
true.
Their assumption, how-
ever, reaches beyond Mc-
Carthy to a belief that the
entire effort to rid the gov-
ernment of subversion and
also to keep before the
American people the in-
credible softness of previ-
ous administrations toward
Communism will collapse.
But to make sure that in
case the anticipated lull in
anti-Communist feeling does
not come as a matter of
course, it becomes necessary
for the friends of appease-
ment to destroy those oth-
er than McCarthy who have
sounded the alarm. Thus,
their next shining mark is
Vice-President Nixon, who
presented the issue vigor-
ously to the voters in the
recent campaign.
The technique of political
attack always proceeds
along two distinctly differ-
ent lines. First, there is dis-
paragement: "The fellow
really doesn't amount to
anything." Second, there is
the stimulation of fear: "The
fellow is dangerous."
These are inconsistent
one with the other. But
consistency and logic are
not political requirements.
In the attack upon Nix-
on, a writer said shortly
after the election that all
the travels and speeches of
Nixon were fruitless. That
the Mountain States re-
mained the same. Murray,
Neuberger and O'Mahoney
were elected. And while
Idaho and Colorado elected
Republican Senators, Nixon
had nothing to do with the
result there.
Omitted is Utah, also a
Mountain State. In that
State after the disastrous
Stringfellow affair the
pinch-hitter Republican
candidate won easily.
And in Nevada, the vic-
tory of McCarran's man
should give no comfort to
appeasement.
Arizona elected a Demo-
cratic Governor. but in Cal-
ifornia the Republicans
held their own. Nixon was
a powerful influence in the
outcome there.
On the House side of the
picture the Republican Par-
ty actually added a seat in
the 17 reclamation States.
But despite the assertion
that Nixon actually helped
the opposition, these writ-
ers say that he is a sinister
and dangerous person. Nix-
onism, they say, will sup-
plant McCarthyism. Nixon
is a "white collar" McCar-
thy.
All of this, of course, is
the echo of a "liberalism"
which would have you as-
sume that we are as we
were at the turn of the cen-
turyâ€”when everybody
could say anything and do
anything and join anything
because we were as a na-
tion immune from foreign
danger and Marxism was
merely a casual interest of
dilettantes.
That this sort of open-
mindedness is inappropri-
ate for present conditions
is a truth that Americans
neglect at their own peril.
And Nixon at the moment
is the foremost exponent
of that truth.
