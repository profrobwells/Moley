NEW THIRD
PARTY?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is no secret that among
wise Republicans there is
a fear almost amounting to
panic that the McCarthy af-
fair may end in the forma-
tion of a third party created
by unhappy Republicans.
This fear is stimulating
the effort to compromise the
censure issue and to get it
out of the way without a
showdown. And McCarthy
is adding to the fear by in-
viting the showdown.
However, from every-
thing that I can discover,
it is not McCarthy himself
nor the McCarthy issue that
is the real danger.
It is doubtful if McCarthy
has any intention to lead a
third-party movement. Nor
is the McCarthy issue alone
sufficient to provoke a dissi-
dent movement in the Re-
publican Party.
I cannot believe that a
single issue such as that
raised by McCarthy can
sustain such a movement
long enough to be a serious
threat in 1956.

Serious rifts in major par-
ties in the past have been
based upon broad differ-
ences in philosophy, such
as those which inspired the
Progressive Party in 1912.
McCarthy has distinct
limitations as a potential
party leader, aside from the
very important fact that he
probably does not want to
assume such a role.
He is limited in his grasp
and comprehension of the
many facets of a real con-
servative philosophy.
It is not too much to say
that he is a one-issue man,
although at the moment
that issue of Communism is
important and has great
emotional impact.
To put it another way,
the conservative discontent
in the Republican Party is
much too broad for the com-
prehension of the Wisconsin
Senator.
It involves distrust of
many of those, official and
unofficial, who seem to have
the ear and confidence of
the President.
★
It involves a conviction
that a middle-of-the-road
course is not a sufficiently
real break from the New
and Fair Deals.
It involves a belief, firm-
ly held by a great many peo-
ple in the Republican Par-
ty, that a measure like the
Bricker amendment should
not have been opposed by
the President.
It involves the conten-
tions of a great many peo-
ple that the new adminis-
tration, instead of rooting
out the incompetence and
exposing the corruption
which characterized the
Truman administration, has
failed to keep its promise
to economize.
It involves people who
hold, with Sen. Knowland,
that we are too soft in our
foreign policy.
It involves thousands of
loyal party workers who re-
sent the administration's re-
fusal to provide more jobs.
These sources of discon-
tent, partly matters of prin-
ciple and partly of political
policy, are serious. They
are already activating many
people in efforts to make
protests effective.

Several meetings have
been held to consider plans
and possibilities. Some sug-
gest the creation of a sort
of right-wing ADA—a non-
partisan group, North and
South, capable of support-
ing candidates of either par-
ty who fit the ideological
requirements of the group.
Others would limit such
efforts to setting up a pub-
licity and propaganda bu-
reau in Washington.
Others propose to form a
new political party which
they hope can swing such
a balance of power as to
force the Republican Party
as a matter of self-preserva-
tion to move to the right.
Such conservative dissent
is, as I say, broader than
McCarthy and the issue he
raises. It is serious and it
is deeply concerning Repub-
lican politicians.
