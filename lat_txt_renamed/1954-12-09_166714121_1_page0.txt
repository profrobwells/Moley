RAYMOND MOLEY:
Despite New Therapy,
TB Is Still a Killer
The deep emotions of
thousands of Americans
must have been moved by
the news that in November
the Trudeau Sanatorium at
Saranac Lake closed its
doors after 70 years in the
service of TV patients.
The last patient was Lar-
ry Doyle, second baseman
for the New York Giants of
another generation.
In all those years the
name Trudeau has been fa-
miliar to "lungers" every-
where and to everyone else
familiar with the disease.
He gave his long life and for-
ever identified his name
with the relentless war
against what was once the
great white plague, an ene-
my which is still not to be
meanly estimated.
*
The closing of Trudeau
was not unexpected.
Many other institutions
of the kind in recent years
found their service no long-
er indispensable.
Only a few years ago I
sought out the sanatorium
in Denver where I served
some time in my 20s and
found that it had been
turned into a school. This
was a happy transforma-
tion.
The death rate in the
United States from TB was
140 per 100,000 in 1915. In
1953 it was 12.6. In New
York City tuberculosis cases
registered fell 10% in the
past year alone; new cases
dropped 7%, and the death
rate fell 15%.
All this is good news. It
marks among other things
the progress that has been
possible through science
and public education and
propaganda.
*
As I remember those days
in Denver, the doctor's
stethoscope and the micro-
scope were all that were
used to detect the insidious
attack of the enemy.
The X ray came later.
The "cure" was to help the
processes of nature with
rest, fresh air and plenty of
proper food.
Later, with X ray and
other means of making an
early diagnosis, there came
surgery as a method of
treatment.
After a generation of
cruel deceptions with fake
medicines, drugs were
found to combat the tough
germs, or as they were
called in the trade, the
"bugs" that are the agents
of the disease.
Only 10 years ago there
appeared the first of the au-
thentic drug weapons such
as streptomycin, para-ami-
no salicylic acid and ison-
iazid.
The death rate dropped
apace and the cottage rest
kind of treatment declined.
But all this good news
should not stay your hand
this Christmas season when
you are asked to buy and
use Christmas Seals. In-
deed, there is every reason
to buy more than ever. Sci-
ence and education have
"scotched the snake, not
killed it."
Despite the great drop in
the death rate, TB still
ranks above all other com-
municable diseases. The
number of cases is still an
immense 400,000, and if
everyone were properly di-
agnosed there would prob-
ably be 300,000 more.
*
Modern drugs weaken
the germs and give nature
a better chance to attack
them, but they are not
killed. The drugs, are no
specifics for the bacilli.
The cases which have
achieved an arrested status
are in danger of relapse for
a long while.
The drift of great num-
bers of Negroes from the
South and of Puerto Ricans
into our great cities is ac-
companied by crowding into
tenements.
These people have no in-
herited power of resistance.
They have not, as have
some of the rest of us, been
exposed to urban, crowded
living for generations.
In their case only the
fear among politicians of
singling them out for a real
drive against the disease
and its cause prevents a
great new victory.
*
To do so, it is thought,
would suggest segregation,
which in the political dic-
tionary these days is a hor-
rid word.
An immense task still re-
mains before the devoted
men and women who have
been fighting TB. They still
need plenty of help from a
public which seems these
days to have money for
everything else.
