RAYMOND MOLEY:
More Federal Spending
Looms in New Program
The program that will be
offered to the new Demo-
cratic Congress by the Presi-
dent will certainly lack any
items of exciting voter ap-
peal. But what is worse, it
will once more be a depar-
ture from the road to a bal-
anced budget. If there is to
be any excitement Congress
will have to provide it.
There will be a consider-
able highway program. This
will take a lot of Federal
money but it will also seek
to encourage local and State
spending.
*
The President put the
preparation of this in the
custody of Gen. Clay, a for-
mer Army engineer, and
like all Army engineers, he
is more interested in spend-
ing than in saving public
money.
Congress can very prop-
erly shelve this proposition
until the Commission of In-
ternational Relations has re-
ported. For this group,
once headed by Clarence
Manion, is supposed to im-
plement the pledge of Can-
didate Eisenhower in 1952
that tax sources should be
returned to the States in or-
der that Federal grants
might be scaled down.
There will be administra-
tion endorsement of that
monstrous pork barrel
known as the Upper Colo-
rado Storage Project. In
fact, the President has al-
ready given his approval in
writing to a western Sen-
ator.
*
That undercuts another
commission, the Hoover
group, which will have
something to say about the
excessive cost of reclama-
tion in arid States.
The appointment of for-
mer Budget Director Dodge
as chairman of a new Coun-
cil on Foreign Economic
Policy is no encouragement
that foreign spending on
economic matters will be re-
duced. For, as Budget direc-
tor. Dodge was no champion
goal-tender for the Trea-
sury.
The fact is that the ad-
ministration will recom-
mend more additions to the
program for Asia than it
will save in Europe.
*
Every year promises are
made that the program has
a terminal date, but the fol-
lowing year's announce-
ment puts the day farther
into the future.
The extension of the re-
ciprocal trade program will
be recommended. But that
is substantially routine and
has been so since early in
the Roosevelt regime. There
is always some debate, and
then a decision in Congress
to give it another term.
The Democrats, especially
the left wing of the party in
Congress, will make what
they can of the public power
issue. They scream about
"giveaway," what they
mean is that they want to
give away more money for
public power projects.
*
But that means spending
more money. To scrap Dix-
on-Yates, if that can be done
by Congress, will add more
than $100,000,000 of public
expenditure. If it is possi-
ble to revive the Federal
dam for Hell's Canyon and
to stop the Idaho Power
Co.'s plan that will mean
more than $500,000,000. And
so it will go.
It has seemed for a long
time that the meat on the
public power issue has all
been eaten away. But so
long as there are no other
good issues, the Morses and
the Murrays and the Gores
and the Kefauvers will boil
the bones.
Meanwhile, the taxpayer
will be told to go back to
the end of the queue and
wait his turn for Federal
favor. He is likely to be
standing in line for some
years.
