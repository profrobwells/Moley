One of the main reasons
why the Federal govern-
ment spends so much is
that the Comptroller Gen-
eral does not control. He
permits himself to be
swamped with the audit of
past expenditures. And
there is a vast difference
between audit and control.
The President has now
sent to the Senate as nom-
inee for the immensely im-
portant office of Comptrol-
ler General the name of a
man who appears to be a
merely routine auditor.
This nominee should be
rejected for the simple rea-
son that his qualifications
and experience do not fit
the potential powers of the
job.
In 1921, when the epoch-
making Budget and Ac-
counting Act was passed,
the intent of the framers
was to create an officer of
immense power. No other
officer outside of the judi-
ciary enjoys such independ-
ence as the Comptroller
General.
He is appointed for a
term of 15 years, which
makes him independent of
any one President or any
one Congress. The Presi-
dent cannot remove him.
Only impeachment or a
joint resolution of Congress
with cause can get him out.
The Comptroller General
is nominated by the Presi-
dent but is really appointed
by the Senate on confirma-
tion. He is essentially an
officer of Congress.
His powers are enormous,
despite the fact that they
have never really been fully
exercised. He can settle all
claims in which the United
States is interested, either
as debtor or creditor, and
such settlement is "final
and conclusive upon the
executive branch of the
government."
He can on his own ini-
tiative and without direc-
tion of Congress investigate
"all matters relating to the
receipt, disbursement, and
application of public funds."
When he conducts inves-
tigations he can command
all departments to furnish
information and give access
to records on request.
But all this power-or
the more important part of
it-has lain dormant for
more than 30 years. The
reason is that the office
which is called the General
Accounting Office got itself
overwhelmed by govern-
ment accounting. This has
become so detailed a job
that the office has become a
bureaucracy in itself.
The Hoover Commission
recommended that there be
an accountant general in
the Treasury who should
take over this burden from
the Comptroller General.
This, as was the case in
many other sound recom-
mendations, was ignored
by Congress.
Auditing is locking the
door after the horse is
stolen. Control is to see to
it that the horse is not stolen
in the first place.
Joseph Campbell, the
President's nominee for
Comptroller General, is an
estimable gentleman who
was treasurer of Columbia
University while Eisenhow-
er was President there. He
was brought to Washington
a year and a half ago to be
a member of the Atomic
Energy Commission.
It is to be hoped that
when this nomination
comes up for consideration
the broad scope of the
office will be made known
and that the nomination
will be rejected without
any personal reflection on
Mr. Campbell.
Then the President
should be urged by the
Congressional leaders to get
a real investigator for this
neglected job.
