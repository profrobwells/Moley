THE REECE
FUROR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

As I noted in a previous
piece, the storm of contro-
versy over the Reece Re-
port is likely to obscure the
genuine problems involved
in the management of the
great tax-exempt founda-
tions. I have already noted
some of the provocative ele-
ments in those controversi-
al aspects. It is more impor-
tant to consider the serious
questions of the public in-
terest involved.

After a careful reading of
the reports, majority and
minority, the replies of the
large foundations, the hear-
ings which were terminated
because of the behavior of
minority member Hays, and
the 800 pages of the 1952
Cox committee hearings
and report, a number of ob-
servations seem to me to be
in order:

No one can deny the great
advantages of the founda-
tion as an institution or of
the management of such in-
stitutions in the early days
when they were largely lim-
iting themselves to medical
research and education and
to the granting of unre-
stricted sums to colleges
and universities.

It is in the more recent
days, when some founda-
tions have turned to other
activities, that the basis of
controversy has appeared.

A serious problem is
raised when a foundation's
resources are entirely limit-
ed to the common stock of a
single going corporation.
Such a problem is not pres-
ent when there is diversifi-
cation of assets.

Several of the foundations
are afflicted with what a
college president described
to me as "projectitis." He
defined this by saying that
he had often sought help
for his very worthy college
from the major foundations,
only to find that they were
willing to make grants only
on such terms as to reduce
the status of his college to
that of a mere agent for the
management of foundations
to play with.

This, he added, would if
pursued reduce the present-
ly free institutions of higher
learning to a condition of
abject dependence.

There is no question in
my mind, after watching
the projects favored by sup-
port of the larger founda-
tions for a number of years,
that there is justification for
the charge made in the ma-
jority report of the Reece
committee that there has
been an excessive emphasis
on empiricism in so-called
"social science" research.

This began in the 1920s
when the Social Science Re-
search Council was formed
as a sort of holding com-
pany for a number of foun-
dations.

There was then, and there
still is, a bland and naive
but dangerous belief that
through the methods of the
natural sciences alone the
nature of man and his con-
duct can be weighed, meas-
ured and controlled. This
purely materialistic atti-
tude violates the beliefs of
many religions and schools
of philosophy. It also runs
counter to the common
sense of millions of Amer-
icans.

There is, of course, room
for measurements, counting
of noses and objective ob-
servation to supplement
older concepts of human be-
havior.

But to rely implicitly
upon the slide rules, ques-
tionnaires and other em-
pirical substitutes for judg-
ment is to accept a philos-
ophy of which Marx was
the most logical exponent.

In answer to those who
claim that materialism and
empirical research have
been overstressed, Dean
Rusk, president of the
Rockefeller Foundation,
makes the absurd statement
that the only alternative
to his method is a "retreat
into enforced ignorance"
and that "knowledge is to
he preferred to superstition
and prejudice."

He might be reminded
that a brand-new supersti-
tion is abroad in the land—
the belief that human con-
duct and natural phenom-
ena are basically identical
and can be controlled by
the same methods.
