THE EGGHEAD THEORY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In order to belong to and
to enjoy good standing in
the United Brotherhood of
Eggheads and Anti-Republi-
can-Old-Guards, a firm be-
lief in certain dogmas is re-
quired.

These dogmas can be con-
veniently arranged in the
following imperfect syllo-
gism: Republicans consti-
tute a minority of the elec-
torate; Eisenhower must
have a majority to win an
election; therefore Eisen-
hower must be a President
for both parties.

*

Let us examine these as-
sertions in the light of the
cold and sober facts.

The people to whom I re-
fer have asserted in print
over and over since 1952
that the Republicans did not
win the election of that
year; that Eisenhower won
and dragged with him
enough Senators and Rep-
resentatives to control Con-
gress.

They "prove" that asser-
tion by saying that more
Democrats voted for mem-
bers of the House than Re-
publicans. That assertion is
the truth.

There were cast 239,271
more Democratic votes than
Republican votes for mem-
bers of the House.

But that truth is not the
whole truth. For in 1952
there were only 342 Con-
gressional districts in which
there were contests.

*

In 1953, there were no
contests. If we were to count
only those votes in the dis-
tricts in which there were
contests, Republicans would
have outnumbered Demo-
crats by 3,282,518.

Since in the uncontested
districts, mainly in the
South, there is no way of
telling how many votes
would have been cast had
there been contests, it de-
stroys all meaning to in-
clude the votes in the un-
contested districts in an
over-all estimate of the rela-
tive strength of the parties.
For even with the weak
Republican Party organiza-
tion in the Southern States
and in some of the Northern
districts, the margin of 239,-
271 would probably have
been wiped out had there
been contests.

*

Of the 93 uncontested
districts, 82 were Dem-
ocratic districts, and 75 of
those were in the South. In
determining what the av-
erage number of Republican
votes per district would
have to be to overcome the
over-all lead, we should
subtract from the 82 the 11
uncontested Republican dis-
tricts. That gives us 71 net.

It would require only an
average of 3371 Republican
votes per district to over-
come the over-all national
Democratic lead.

The figures are not avail-
able for the potential-Re-
publican vote in the South-
ern districts, but I can offer
a figure for an uncontested
Democratic district in New
York City. In the 18th, for-
merly held by Vito Marcan-
tonio, Republicans and
Democrats alike voted for
James G. Donovan, a Dem-
ocrat. There were 17,263
Republicans in that Demo-
cratic vote.

The fallacy of the advice
given the President be-
comes still more marked
when it is considered that
its tendency is always to-
ward what is called "liber-
alism."

*

He must, say the Egg-
heads, advocate more of the
policies favored by the
Humphrey-Murray-Lehman
Democrats. But these con-
stitute only about 50-odd
per cent of the Democrats
of the nation. The others
are conservative.

How about appealing to
them with conservative pol-
icies?

The real truth is that
there are enough conserva-
tive Republicans to win an
election if they are gotten
to the polls. It is not neces-
sary that Eisenhower be-
come a President without a
party to win in 1956.

All he needs is to be con-
sistently and constructively
conservative.
