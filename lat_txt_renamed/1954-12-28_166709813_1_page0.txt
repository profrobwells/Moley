THE VOTE BREAKDOWN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a previous article I ex-
amined some of the conten-
tions of the pro-Eisenhower
but anti-Republican "liber-
als" in the light of the 1952
vote for the House of Repre-
sentatives.
That group, small in num-
ber but very articulate and
well represented among the
President's advisers, would
by distorting election re-
turns prevail upon the Pres-
ident to turn his face reso-
lutely away from the con-
servative members of his
party and embrace a com-
promise with a form of
"liberalism" which, they
say, would bring to his sup-
port many "liberal" Demo-
crats.
Those people have assured
us over and over that the
Republican Party is a hope-
less minority, as was
"proved" by the fact that
in the election of 1952 Re-
publican candidates for the
House polled 239,271 fewer
votes than their Democratic
opponents.
*
The fallacy of this, I
pointed out, is that in 1952
there were 93 districts in
which there was no contest,
and that 82 of those districts
were Democratic.
In the contested districts
the Republican margin of
superiority was 3,282,518.
Another point those peo-
ple make is that Eisen-
hower was stronger than
his party, since he received
56.4% of the vote outside
the South, while Republican
House candidates received
only 54.8%.
This is likely to be true of
any popular President. It
has been almost invariably
true in the past.
The Republican Party
was indeed fortunate to
have so popular a candidate.
He helped many "liberal"
as well as conservative Re-
publican candidates.
The deduction should not
be drawn from such asser-
tions that Eisenhower can
safely repudiate any wing
or faction of his party. For
the Democratic Party is
just as anxious to destroy
him as any member of the
Republican Party. Demo-
crats are, as they should be,
in business to elect Demo-
crats.
Within the week the As-
sociated Press has released
an analysis of the House
vote in 1954. It is not a com-
plete tabulation, but it will
suffice for a few deductions.
The vote for Democratic
candidates for the House
over the nation was 2,185,-
327 greater than the vote
for Republican candidates.
But the vote in 11 South-
ern States for Democratic
candidates was 3,006,083
while the vote for the Re-
publican candidates was
only 656,050. In the 35 re-
maining States the Republi-
can majority was 164,686.
The figures on the con-
tested and uncontested seats
are not available, but it is
probable that the propor-
tion of uncontested dis-
tricts was substantially the
same as 1952.
The assumption that the
Democratic Party is more
than 2,000,000 voters in ex-
cess of the Republican
Party is untenable because
of the large number of un-
contested districts and also
because there was apparent-
ly a very large Republican
stay-at-home vote.
This must be true because
surely there are more Re-
publicans in the South than
the average of 6200 in the
106 districts in the 11
Southern States. The aver-
age vote for both parties in
the Southern States was
only 34,550, while in the
other States it was 117,680.
A comparison of the 1954
House vote with that in
1950 indicates a relatively
smaller turnout of Re-
publicans.
*
This was in spite of the
fact that, unlike 1950, the
Republicans had a Presi-
dent in the White House
this year and that party
workers had a larger pro-
portion of Federal patron-
age.
The President, who, it is
asserted, could do very well
without his party, made
heroic efforts to get out the
Republican vote. Despite all
this, the Republicans of
1950 seemed to have more
vitality than they had in
1954.
There is little in this
record to justify the asser-
tion of the "liberals" that
Eisenhower can afford to
repudiate any members of
his party.
He can well take as his
motto the old political prin-
ciple that the job of a lead-
er is "to assimilate, not
eliminate."
