RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Political Spectrum
of the 83rd Congress
In a previous article I re-
ferred to a study which had
been made of the votes of
Senators on. 150 issues in
the 83rd Congress and the
ranking of those Senators
in what I called the politi-
cal spectrum, from extreme
conservative to extreme lib-
eral. (1 use the word "lib-
eral" in its current sense of
a belief in more interven-
tion by government in the
national economy.)
That study also ranks
members of the House of
Representatives in their or-
der on the same basis of
votes.
It may he of interest to
list some of the names in
hoth Senate and House in
this classification.
In the Senate the 15 top
conservatives, in their rank
from Sen. Watkins down,
are: Watkins, Bennett, Mar-
tin, Goldwater, J. M. Rutler,
Hickenlooper, Schoeppel,
Barrett, Williams, Jenner,
Malone, Dworshak, Potter,
Millikin and Bricker.
*
These I presume the gen-
tlemen of the left wing
would call the elite of the
Old Guard.
The 15 top liberals, in
their rank from the most.
liberal Murray up, are: Mur-
ray, Kilgore, Lehman,
Humphrey, Kefauver, Hill,
Heanings, Neely, Fulbright,
Magnuson, Morse. Spark-
man, Jackson, Monroney
and Mansfield.
The 15 who are exactly in
the middle of the road are:
McCarthy, Duff, Holland,
Ives, Young. Byrd, Daniel,
Robertson, Frear, Smathers,
E. C. Johnson. Ellender,
Cooper, Long and Stennis.
These. It would seem, are
the people around whom the
President should presuma-
bly build the new party
which we are hearing so
much about. It is note-
worthy that this list in-
cludes, in my book at least,
none of the outstanding
members except Byrd and
Holland
In the House, the top con-
servatives rank in this or-
der, from the most conser-
vative Taber down: Taber,
Neal, Utt, Dondero, Arends,
J. W. Byrnes, D. A. Reed,
Jackson, Merrill, McCulloch,
McDonough. J. J. Allen,
Betts, G. R. Davis and
Hiestand.
â˜…
In the House the top lib-
crals are, counting up from
the most liberal Franklin D.
Roosevelt Jr.: Roosevelt,
Powell, Machrowicz, G. Mill-
er, Perkins, A. B. Kelley,
Klein, Mollohan, Morgan,
Buckley, Metcalf, Madden,
Fine, Green and Condon.
The 15 in the middle of
the road are, in the House:
Seely-Brown, Alexander. D.
Rogers, W. Harrison, Ker-
sten, Gathings, Tollefson,
Campbell, E. Robeson, Gary,
Heselton, Burleson, Her-
long, Shuford and Norrell.
A number of reflections
concerning politics and life
might be built upon this
ranking.
Almost all of us, includ-
ing President Eisenhower,
would like to be called
"moderate" or a part of
"the happy mean" or "the
middle of the road.".
But when we choose that
course in public life we are
not likely to be known as
leaders. We are neutral, un-
classified, indeterminate.
Leaders take positions.
They stand out as one thing
or another. They have
strong friends and often bit-
ter enemies.
Perhaps it would be a
more peaceful world if we
all were moderate. But it
would not be so interesting.
