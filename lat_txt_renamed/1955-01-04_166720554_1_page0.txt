SOME BIG DAM FOOLISHNESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is difficult for those of
us who do not live in the
vast Missouri Valley to
appreciate the reality of the
flood-control controversy
which involves that arca.
On the one hand are some
of the people in the cities
downstream who believe
that big dams will protect
their lives and property
from the rushing waters
which originate far up
among the sources of the
Missouri and its tributaries.
There are also those who
see in enormous expendi-
tures in selected communi-
ties great advantages to
business. The highly artic-
ulate and energetic pro-
moters of big dams are
those who build them, the
Army Engineers.
On the other hand are the
farmers in the upper
reaches of the rivers, their
Congressmen and other
public servants, and the
U.S. Department of Agri-
culture.

They claim that big dams
intensify rather than pre-
vent great floods, that the
costs far outweigh their
benefits, and that they not
only inundate and destroy
vast areas of valuable farm
land in the lower valleys
but take no account of the
real problem of soil erosion
in the upper valleys, and
that big dams are in fact
silt traps which in a rela-
tively short time are filled
up and make necessary the
building of still more dams
upstream.
The case for the latter
point of view has never
been presented in more un-
derstandable or more con-
vincing form than in a
small but serious book,
"Big Dam Foolishness,"
by Elmer Peterson, an edi-
tor in Oklahoma City. His
writings on the subject are
already well known to
readers of national maga-
zines.
The Army Engineers,
against whom Peterson lev-
els a deadly lance, are men
who well deserve the praise
of all Americans for many
fine services. But they also
partake of the nature of all
bureaucrats, which is to
make work and glory for
themselves.
Moreover, they seem to
enjoy a curious independ-
ence in our system of gov-
ernment. It has always been
difficult to determine ex-
actly who in the Federal
hierarchy really controls
them.
The standing that the En-
gineers have built up with
Congress over the years, the
vast patronage involved in
projects favored by the En-
gineers, and the skill with
which they exercise their
public relations render them
practically immune to exec-
utive control.
Peterson, however, makes
a powerful case for the con-
trol of rivers near their
source. What is needed is
many small and relatively
inexpensive dams and oth-
er forms of keeping the wa-
ter where it falls.
Such methods, well
planned by the Soil Conser-
vation Service, would not
only minimize floods but
prevent the tragic loss of
topsoil.
★
We have already lost a
third of the precious topsoil
upon which the future food
supply of the nation must
depend. Every year a cubic
mile of such soil passes New
Orleans on its way to salt
water.
The Engineers have spent
billions, but floods still con-
tinue. Peterson estimates
that the ultimate projects
for the Missouri Valley will
cost 57 billion dollars more.
When the Engineers are
confronted with the stark,
indisputable fact that the
dams they build down-
stream create lakes, not of
water, but of silt, their an-
swer is that more dams
must be built.
The year 2053 will, ac-
cording to Peterson, see a
Missouri Valley composed
of a series of silt terraces,
void of agriculture, over
which a river will wander
capriciously for all time to
come.
