James F. Byrnes, since
he entered the House of
Representatives in 1911,
has earned and held the
reputation of "getting
things done." His thinking
is sharp, incisive, efficient.
And action never lingers
after the thought.
President Roosevelt
leaned heavily upon him for
many years and regarded
him as his most effective
friend in the legislative
branch of government.
When war came and the
machinery of production
got itself tangled in red
tape, the President took the
extraordinary step of per-
suading Byrnes to leave the
Supreme Court to assume
the temporary, indetermi-
nate but important job of
Director of Economic Sta-
bilization.
*
His reward should have
been the Vice-Presidential
nomination in 1944. I have
considered all of the avail-
able evidence, including the
personal and unwritten ad-
missions of the man who
frustrated the Byrnes nom-
ination, the late E. J. Flynn,
who was New York nation-
al committeeman at the
time.
My conclusion is that
Roosevelt intended to give
Byrnes the nomination with
him on the 1944 ticket, that
he promised it to Byrnes,
and that only the insistence
of Flynn and the threat of
losing New York persuad-
ed a sick and distracted
Roosevelt to go back on his
promise to Byrnes and to
agree to Truman.
And so Byrnes, who was
distinguished by a variety
of high offices beyond any
statesman of his time,
missed the Presidency be-
cause of a broken promise.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Not the least of the fine
achievements of this ex-
traordinary man has been
his most recent as Governor
of South Carolina.
While many of us who
are far from the interracial
problems of the South have
been expending our ener-
gies in condescending talk
about the poor schools of
the South, and while the
Supreme Court has laid
down a fiat about segrega-
tion which it does not know
how to enforce, Byrnes has
done something about it.
Byrnes should be al-
lowed to describe his rev-
SKANDEL
Gov, James Byrnes
olution in his own words
as he leaves office this
week:
"When I became Gover-
nor, there were approxi-
mately 1200 school districts
in the State. Now we have
only 102. The one-teacher
schools of the rural areas
have almost all been aban-
doned. Since 1951 the con-
solidation program has
eliminated 824 inferior
schools in rural areas. Of
these, 287 were white
schools and 537 Negro
schools.
"The boys and girls who
attended these schools now
attend consolidated schools.
"The consolidation of
schools increased the pupil
transportation problem be-
cause consolidation has
produced the necessity of
transporting a great num-
ber of pupils to and from
schools. When the State
took over the transporta-
tion system in 1951, 142,000
pupils were being trans-
ported to and from school.
This year 241,000 ride to
and from school daily.
"The number of Negro
pupils being transported
throughout the State has
increased from 29,000 in
1951 to 79,000 in 1954. Sub-
stantial equality with the
transportation of white pu-
pils has been attained...
*
"Negro schools have re-
ceived two-thirds of the
funds allocated by the State
for buildings. When the
buildings already approved
for Negro pupils have heen
constructed, their facilities
will be substantially equal
to those for white pupils.
"Negro pupils comprise
only 229,000 of the public
schools' enrollment of 525,-
000. An average of $147
has been allocated for each
white pupil and $314 for
each Negro pupil under our
building program."
Byrnes has reached the
age of 75. To know him,
however, is to refrain from
calling this "old" or "ripe"
or "venerable."
For his spring and vigor
suggest the waste of per-
mitting this useful states-
man to be unemployed.
There is so much to be
done and so few who know
the knack of doing it!
