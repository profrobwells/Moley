ANTI-M'CARTHY TECHNIQUE
It is hardly necessary to
mention that the pattern
of the leftists who domi-
nate such a large part of
the Democratic Party and
also of the so-called "liber-
al" Republicans in their
campaign to drive a wedge
between the Vice-President
and the President follows
the pattern used in the
long campaign against Sen.
McCarthy.
With powerful help be-
cause of the indiscretions
and extreme comments of
McCarthy, the campaign
against him succeeded. And
so the opposition moves on
to knock off one after an-
other of the people who
have attempted to hold the
Roosevelt-Truman regime
responsible for its softness
toward subversive ele-
ments in and out of gov-
ernment.

Once more the promot-
ers of the unending cam-
paign to isolate the Presi-
dent from a majority of his
party have been helped by
an old and familiar trick
practiced in his press con-
ferences. The President, by
adding lengthy comments
to what might have been
an adequate answer, pro-
vided a backhanded blow
to his party.
In this instance, the
President was asked for
his opinion about attacks
on Nixon "for the manner
in which he conducted
himself in the 1954 cam-
paign." It took approxi-
mately 230 words for the
President to answer that
simple question. In the
course of that answer, he
said that (a) he did not be-
lieve that any party is
guilty of treason, (b) that
there are as many patriots
in one party as in the other,
(c) that "he had never

heard" of Nixon making a
charge that the whole
Democratic Party is a par-
ty of treason; (d) that Nix-
on had so assured him, (e)
that not only Nixon but
the people who were criti-
cizing him were loyal and
patriotic, (f) that he would
admit that "in the heat" of
a campaign words might
"be taken out of context"
and be "the subject of legit-
imate criticism." Finally,
he asked if the man who
asked the question had
read Nixon's speeches.
This highly qualified an-
swer enabled a prominent
anti-Nixon newspaper to
say correctly in a first-page
headline that the President
had defended both Nixon
and Nixon's critics. All this
is highly satisfying to the
anti-Nixon people, who can
say that all that the Presi-
dent had to go on was
Nixon's word, that the
Democratic Party (which
they will identify with the
Truman administration)
had just as many loyal peo-
ple as the Republican Party
(which they will identify
with the Eisenhower ad-
ministration).
All this leaves Nixon in
a highly probationary status
so far as the President is
concerned.
It does not, however, less-
en the admiration for
Nixon held by those Re-
publicans who believe that
a campaign is a campaign
and that its purpose is to
hold the opposition respon-
sible.
I have read Nixon's cam-
paign speeches so far as
they were written out. I
secured them immediately
after the election, because
the success of the Republi-
can Party in the States
where Nixon did most of
his campaigning made it
clear to me that an attack
would be made later on.
And I found no scintilla of
evidence to support Nixon's
critics.

What Nixon said over
and over was that 6926 se-
curity risks had been un-
earthed since the Republi-
can Party took over in
1953, that the Truman ad-
ministration had cleared
and hired these people, and
that the Eisenhower admin-
istration had fired them.
This is true. It is legiti-
mate campaigning. It holds
an administration account-
able for what happens un-
der it. And it was very good
evidence indeed that the
Truman administration had
been lax in protecting the
national security.
Of course, behind this at-
tack upon Nixon is a bitter
memory and a great fear.
The memory is that Nixon
was the man who brought
the Hiss case to the bar of
justice, and fear is that
Nixon in 1956 will be a
powerful factor in prevent-
ing a return to power of a
Fair Deal regime.
