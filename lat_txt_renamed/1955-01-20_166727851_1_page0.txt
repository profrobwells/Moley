TO UTOPIA
BY ROAD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The report of Gen. Clay's
committee for a national
highway program, on which
the President has promised
a special message on Jan. 27,
seems to be only the opening
chapter of a vast adventure
in spending which goes far
beyond anything proposed
in the pump-priming days of
the Roosevelt regime. For
beyond this proposal for
highways, others are to come
—for schools, for reclama-
tion, for housing, and for
other public works.
It may well be that Demo-
cratic politicians who sat at
the feet of F.D.R. and
H.S.T. and conceived the
political advantages of
spending public money will
really learn something from
this administration. For its
head is a general, and many
of those who have great in-
fluence are likewise military
men. Mere politicians must
always keep one eye on the
taxpayer. But generals need
not worry about the source
of revenue. They are con-
cerned only with the spend-
ing thereof.

Gen. Clay was an Army
engineer, and while the
Corps of Engineers is a fine
body of men, it is very ex-
pensive. The Clay plan is an
Army engineers’ dream.
The Clay plan would add
to the present rate of Fed-
eral aid for highways 25
billion dollars over a 10-year
period. Altogether, that
would mean a Federal in-
vestment of $36,500,000,000.
The bonds for the new high-
ways would run 30 years,
which would require an ad-
ditional $11,500,000,000 in
interest.
As Sen. Byrd points out,
it is a “violent assumption,”
that the bonds will really be
paid off in 30 years, for “we
have not paid off a single
Federal bond in 25 years.”
Our great-grandchildren
may be paying interest on
these Clay roads.

Byrd says further that “it
cannot be assumed that the
Federal government will
have finished the interstate
system when it constructs
40,000 miles... as we grow,
population shifts, and there-
fore our road needs shift
and change. There is no such
thing as a permanent road.”
He might have added
that there will be new and
more expansive and expen-
sive Gen. Clays. There will
also be need for rebuilding,
for roads wear out. In finan-
cial terms, highways are not
assets; they are liabilities,
unless, as in the case of the
toll turnpikes, they yield a
revenue over upkeep and
amortization.
The methods proposed to
finance this program are,
according to Byrd, “unique,
so far as I know. Nothing
similar has ever been offi-
cially presented to Congress
in a Presidential message.”
The plan is to set up a Fed-
eral corporation without as-
sets or income. It would
borrow 20 billion dollars
from the public and be au-
thorized to demand an addi-
tional 5 billion dollars from
the Treasury.

I would add that such
long-term programs raise
grave questions not only of
public policy but of consti-
tutional law. For one Con-
gress is asked to bind sev-
eral successors and to throw
upon them the job of find-
ing revenue. It is also very
bad practice to dedicate the
proceeds of a tax to a spe-
cific purpose. In this case,
it is suggested that the gas
tax be pledged.
I have been attempting
for some weeks to find out
what Federally guaranteed
obligations are already in
existence which are not in-
cluded in the gross figures
of the national debt. It is
my understanding that the
Hoover Commission has a
task force seeking the same
thing. One estimate is 225
billion dollars. Another is
280 billion dollars. These
include the 100 billion dol-
lars of guaranteed bank de-
posits, but even with that
liability deducted the size
of the contingent burden is
excessive. And now we are
on the way to adding many
more billions.
Neither the concept of
great transnational Federal
highways nor this tricky
method of financing is new.
They were under discussion
in the Roosevelt administra-
tion, but F.D.R. never quite
summoned the audacity to
propose them. That seems
to be reserved for the gen-
erals.
