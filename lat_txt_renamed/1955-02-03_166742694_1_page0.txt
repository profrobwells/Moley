MORE FEDERAL POWER
IS STILL THE TREND
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Secretary of Agriculture
Benson made an excellent
speech in New York last
week calling for a fight
against "undue concentra-
tion of power in the Fed-
eral government."
No doubt, such speeches
should be made in every
State, especially in the home
State of the three greatest
centralizers in history, Al-
exander Hamilton and two
Roosevelts, T.R. and F.D.R.
But the proper place to
make those speeches at the
moment is to Benson's boss.
For despite promises in 1952
and many preachments, the
President is tossing in the
receptive lap of Congress a
series of the most signif-
icant proposals for central-
ization in recent times.
★
The tragedy of this cap-
ture of the Presidential
mind by those who would
further contract the already
diminished authority of the
States and local govern-
ments is that there is small
chance that Federal central-
ization can be stopped by
any authority other than
the Chief Executive, who is
theoretically above and be-
yond the clamorous de-
mands of local selfish inter-
ests and the incurable lust
of members of Congress to
get what they can for their
constituents from the Fed-
eral Treasury.
In line with the Presi-
dent's promise in his Des
Moines speech in 1952, he
brought about the creation
of the Commission on Inter-
governmental Relations, still
called by the name of its
former chairman, Dean
Manion.
This commission is com-
posed of 25 members, in-
cluding five Representa-
tives, five Senators and 15
Presidential appointees.
No sooner was it organ-
ized than, for reasons that
are still disputed, Chair-
man Manion was told to re-
sign by the ubiquitous
Sherman Adams. Then the
President replaced Manion
with Meyer Kestnbaum, a
Chicago businessman and
an Eisenhower Republican.
After a period of recov-
ery from the shock of the
Manion affair the several
task forces moved on to pre-
pare the necessary reports,
indicated by the purpose of
the commission, to suggest,
means of returning some of
the power usurped by the
Federal government to the
States.
The task force on high-
ways was, it is reported,
prepared to recommend
that the gasoline tax be en-
tirely taken over by the
States and that the States
should, with some limited
Federal help, build their
own highways.
For some reason the orig-
inal report has been al-
tered somewhat, although
apparently the members of
the task force are still
against increasing Federal
responsibility for highways.
But there now comes the
Clay committee on high-
ways, also the creation of
the President, with its
enormous plans for Federal
highway construction.

In the 83rd Congress Sen.
Cooper of Kentucky became
the most active sponsor of
Federal school building
and, as is to be expected,
State and local superin-
tendents were voracious in
their desire for Federal
money and extravagant in
their depiction of the dire
need for new building.
So we may expect a gen-
erous response from the
President in the form of a
seven-billion-dollar build-
ing program, financed
largely, it is reported, by
Uncle Sam.
Thus, the Kestnbaum
commission may on June
30 next be making a report
on what will by that time
be a purely academic sub-
ject. For the President
seems to be moving rapidly
in the direction of anticipat-
ing all the problems of his
own commission with pro-
posals which run counter to
the very purposes for which
it was created.
