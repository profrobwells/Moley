RAYMOND MOLEY:
Engineering Doubts
Shroud Colorado Dam
The immense and ex-
pensive Colorado River
Storage Project, for which
the States of Colorado, Wy-
oming, Utah and New Mex-
ico worked so hard last
year, is once more before
Congress. As in 1954, there
are many versions of the
plan.
The confusion that pre-
vailed among the bureau-
crats who were promoting
it last year was almost ludi-
crous. One estimate of cost
was slightly less than
a billion dollars for con-
struction. Another was
$200,000,000 higher than
that. Another, which was
approved by the Senate
committee, was $1,600,000,-
000.
Figures presented by the
Bureau of Reclamation's en-
gineers were shown to be
egregiously wrong, and Un-
dersecretary Tudor was
compelled to admit it.
This year, however, there
are new and more serious
complications. In the first
place, Gov. Ed Johnson of
Colorado has demanded the
lion's share of the irrigation
projects included in the big
plan for the State of Col-
orado.
He has also suggested the
abandonment, at least for
the time being, of the Echo
Park Dam against which
the lovers of the national
parks fought so hard. His
interpretation of the Col-
orado River seven-State
compact would assign some
extra water to the lower
basin States.
The Johnson plan would
increase the irrigation units
to such a large number as
to put the cost of the proj-
ect up to two or three times
the first 1954 estimate.
Much more serious,
however, is the admis-
sion of Secretary McKay
that there is grave engi-
neering doubt about the
immense Glen Canyon
Dam, which was the key-
stone of the whole project.
In a letter to David Brow-
er of the Sierra Club of San
Francisco, the Secretary ad-
mits that the natural foun-
dations and supports upon
which the dam would be
built "are poorly cemented
and relatively weak... in
comparison with the foun-
dations common to most
high dams."
It seems that when the
proposal to build a dam at
the Glen Canyon site near
the. Utah-Arizona line was
first considered several
years ago, engineers were
of the opinion that the can-
yon walls would not sup-
port a high dam.
In 1950, however, in an
elaborate report on the Up-
per Colorado storage plan,
the engineers of the Bureau
of Reclamation offered the
opinion that the site was
safe and sound. But since
then, according to McKay,
the bureau conducted tests
which threw doubt upon
the stability of the supports.
That is where the matter
now stands. The bureau
doesn't know how high a
dam it will be possible to
build or how much it would
cost.
This is an amazing ad-
mission because the pro-
posed dam at Glen Canyon
would, according to the fig-
ures of the bureau, be the
only part of the whole Up-
per Colorado project that
would be self-liquidating.
In fact, it was planned to
use the revenue from it to
subsidize several of the
financially weak projects in
Colorado, Utah, Wyoming
and New Mexico.
If Glen Canyon is not
feasible, the whole thing
falls to the ground. And if
the dam is built despite
doubts, it may well literally
fall to the ground and inun-
date the entire lower valley,
including the Hoover Dam.
But Secretary McKay
makes the amazing proposal
that Congress should go on
and authorize the thing in
any case and trust this un-
reliable bureau to decide
whether to build or not to
build the doubtful dam.
Also, the President has
been put in the humiliating
position of endorsing the
whole project in his state of
the Union and his budget
messages and in additional
assurances to Senators and
others.
What kind of government
is this, anyhow?
