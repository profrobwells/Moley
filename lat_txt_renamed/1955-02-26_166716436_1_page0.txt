RAYMOND MOLEY:
Conservatism Returns
to the Universities
For those who in recent
years have said to me that
Red radicalism is rampant
among the students of
American colleges, I have
had a stock answer:
"In a few years we will
have the opposite."
Student opinion is like
Chicago weather. Wait a
while and we will get
something else. However,
in Chicago weather changes
are a matter of hours. Col-
lege opinion is a matter of
a couple of decades.
In 1914, when I was first
a student at Columbia the
faculty was notably con-
servative. Among the stu-
dents and younger teachers
there was a turn to the left.
Just to show the miracles
wrought by time I would
record that notable young
radicals like Morrie Rys-
kind and George Sokolsky
were tossed out for their
opinions about that time.
★
There are two quite ob-
vious explanations for this
process of change. The one
is that the younger people
are less securely anchored
in their opinions and are
seeking to improve the
chronic illnesses that al-
ways beset mankind. They
turn from the established
order to something else.
The other reason is the
eternal spirit of revolt by
the young against the old.
Just as in nature every-
where, new growths are
destroying old, students
revolt against their teach-
ers, and young professors
write books to upset the
books written by their el-
ders.
★
And so in the course of
the period from 1914 to
1954, the established order
in academic life has
changed from conservative
to radical. The old fellows
now are mostly to the left
and some of them are very
tired radicals. Something
new is in demand and the
new is different in quality.
To conform is to be radical,
to be a nonconformist is to
be conservative.
The change is very nota-
ble in British universities.
Over there the two forces
are operating with a third
one added. British students
are old enough to remember
the old tired bunch of pinks
who constituted the Labor
government of 1945-1951.
They know something of
the messy austerity that ac-
companied this great trial
of Socialism. Thus to the
British student, Socialism
is not pie in the sky, it is
the crust of a pie that has
been tasted and was sour.
★
In the United States new
conservative clubs are
springing up. It is getting
to be respectable to be a
conservative.
A notable event happened
recently. There was elected
as president of the Whig-
Cliosophic Society at
Princeton a young man
named Bruce Akers of
Cleveland. This society, it
is claimed, is the oldest col-
lege debating and literary
club in the world. James
Madison and Philip Fre-
neau were members in the
18th century. Woodrow
Wilson was a member. It
is a distinguished honor
that has come to this young
Akers and he is a genuine
conservative by conviction
and training.
★
This budding conserva-
tive movement in the col-
leges should be wisely
grounded upon real princi-
ple. There is just as much
danger in some conserva-
tive suggestions these days
as there was a few years
ago among liberals. In oth-
er words, any movement is
sooner or later the victim
of the lunatic fringe and
that fringe exists on each
end of the ideological spec-
trum, the right as well as
the left.
