SOCIALIZED
OIL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Through a fine example
of newspaper enterprise the
Wall Street Journal has
published the details of
what was intended to be a
"secret" report by the Sec-
retariat of the United Na-
tions Economic Commis-
sion for Europe. It proposes
that governmental machin-
ery, which probably would
be implemented by an in-
ternational agreement, fix
"right" prices for crude oil
produced in the Middle
East. This would affect five
American and three Euro-
pean companies.
European newspapers are
full of the subject at the
moment and are interpret-
ing the U.N. proposal as an
attack upon "monopoly." It
is, in fact, an effort to sub-
stitute a Socialistic govern-
ment system of control of
which American companies
would feel the brunt.
I shall give some atten-
tion to the economic aspects
of this proposal at a future
time but at the moment con-
fine my attention to the in-
teresting person who seems
to be masterminding this
scheme.

That person is one Gun-
nar Myrdal, a Swedish So-
cialist. He is the head of the
secretariat which has got-
ten up this scheme. Myrdal
is not unknown in the Unit-
ed States. He was brought
over here by the Carnegie
Corp. to make a study of
the status of the Negro in
the United States. The ap-
propriation by the founda-
tion for that purpose was
$250,000 and the results
were published under the
title "An American Dilem-
ma" in 1944.
Why there should be no
person or persons in the
United States, fit to make
such a study is not clear.
Perhaps the Carnegie peo-
ple felt geographic detach-
ment would be a virtue even
though that detachment
had been so absolute as to
deny the student of this
problem an opportunity to
have lived with the vexing
problems of race in the
South.

At any rate, the Carnegie
Corp. got exactly what it
might have anticipated,
which was a severe indict-
ment of the United States.
The Myrdal rancor toward
the American Constitution
can be illustrated by some
of his comments.
He designates the Ameri-
can respect for the funda-
mental law as "a nearly fan-
tastic cult." He says that
our Constitution "is in
many respects impractical
and ill-suited for modern
conditions," that its adop-
tion was "nearly a plot
against the common peo-
ple," and that "until re-
cently, the Constitution has
been used to block the
popular will."
His contempt for our
culture is equal to his con-
tempt for our Constitution.
One of our cultural traits is,
he says, "a relatively low
degree of respect for law
and order."
Our legal culture is
"anarchistic" but we have a
tendency to regulate hu-
man behavior "tyrannical-
ly."

Myrdal's qualifications
were apparently highly
satisfactory to some Ameri-
cans, for five years after
these animadversions the
Rockefeller Foundation
gave a grant of $12,000 to
the U.N. Economic Com-
mission for Europe. Gunnar
Myrdal was then as now
the executive secretary of
that outfit.
Still earlier than his
Carnegie grant was
Myrdal's turn as a Rocke-
feller fellow at the School
of International Studies at
Geneva.
At the commencement of
Columbia University in 1954
there was a great celebra-
tion of the bicentennial of
that institution. Among
those honored with the de-
gree of doctor of humane
letters was Gunnar Myrdal
who was hailed as the
"distinguished son of a dis-
tinguished kingdom . . . a
man of gifted energies . . .
at home on two continents
. . . making the world his
classroom."
At the moment he seems
to be making the Rockefel-
ler oil companies his foot-
stools.
