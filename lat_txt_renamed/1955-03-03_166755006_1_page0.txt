A HOSTILE
REPORT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a previous article
(March 1) I commented on
the publication from Gene-
va of a story in the Wall
Street Journal concerning a
report on "The Price of Oil
in Western Europe."
This report, which had
some unflattering animad-
versions concerning the five
American companies which
operate in the Middle East,
is, in fact, a covert move to-
ward restrictive price fixing
by international authority.
I outlined the history of
Gunnar Myrdal, the execu-
tive secretary of the Eco-
nomic Commission for East-
ern Europe, which got up
the report in question.
*
The report was quite ful-
ly described in the Wall
Street Journal, but since
reading that item I have
verified my impressions by
a roundabout means of get-
ting at the document itself.
: It describes what it al-
leges as the very low cost of
oil to the companies and
contrasts that with the high
prices charged consumers in
Europe.
One of the American oil
companies involved, Stand-
ard of New Jersey, states
that "the net received by
the oil companies from Mid-
dle East crudes has been
overstated in the paper (pre-
sumably the report) by ex-
actly 100%."
The report, no doubt for
propaganda purposes, sets
forth the antitrust actions
instituted against the Amer-
ican companies and also
draws upon a report by the
Federal Trade Commission,
in 1952, which was highly
uncomplimentary to the
American companies.
*
This sort of thing, of
course, makes excellent an-
ti-American propaganda in
Europe, notably behind the
Iron Curtain.
Many European papers,
which seem to have prefer-
ence over our own news
services in getting access to
such reports, have had a
field day at the expense of
our companies.
I have found that the
document is marked "re-
stricted" and so my curiosi-
ty was directed at the
question why the United
Nations should have any
secrets at all. It need not
worry about security, for it
presumably has no enemies.
It has no military secrets
because it has no army.
Surely, I felt, an Amerl-
can taxpayer who helps to
support the United Nations
and its affiliate that got out
and printed this report
should certainly have ac-
cess to what seems to be
common property in Eu-
rope.
â˜…
And so I had someone
call the United Nations to
request as an American
citizen and taxpayer a copy
of the report. He first asked
for the public relations of-
fice. Somebody there said
that he knew nothing of the
report but to ask for the
documents office.
The documents office
finding that the questioner
was only from an American
citizen said that it had no
right to give anything ex-
cept to a member of a na-
tional delegation. It re-
ferred the questioner to the
American mission.
That mission explained
that since the document was
labeled "restricted" it could
go only "to persons connect-
ed with the subject."
*
The questioner asked,
"An American oil company
for instance?" The answer
was: "Oh, no, only some-
body with the United Na-
tions."
That was the end of the
quest.
Soviet Russia or Poland
could get this document
smearing American com-
panies but not a plain
American citizen.
This is an item of infor-
mation for Americans visit-
ing New York who gaze in
admiration at the U.N.
Building which American
taxpayers have wrought up-
on land given by Mr. Rocke-
feller with money derived
presumably from oil.
