FULBRIGHT'S PROBE MAY BACKFIRE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Hon. J. William Ful-
bright is demonstrating
once more that it is difficult
to transform an academic
politician into a major
political strategist.
For unless some dread-
ful malfeasance or misfeas-
ance in the stock market
can be tied into the Republi-
can Party, the Senate inves-
tigation of that subject may
well become an embarrass-
ment rather than an asset to
its Democratic sponsors.
In terms of the cold
political realities the situ-
ation is this:
If the market breaks and
that break is followed by
unfavorable economic con-
ditions generally, it will be
possible for Republicans to
charge the unsettlement to
the Fulbright "educational"
enterprise.
*
If the market is not seri-
ously affected and the com-
mittee gives the exchange
a clean bill of health, there
can be no Democratic am-
munition in that.
The answer by Republi-
cans will be that the com-
mittee merely discovered
what the Eisenhower ad-
ministration has been say-
ing all the time-namely,
that the prosperity we are
witnessing is sound and de-
sirable.
The Senator himself has
never been an especially
brilliant performer on the
political stage.
Some years ago he under-
took an investigation of the
RFC. There was indeed
plenty to investigate. But
when he found material
which was most embarrass-
ing to his party and his own
Democratic administration,
his zeal suddenly vanished
and the whole matter end-
ed in anticlimax.
Later, the Republican
Party was able to smite
Fulbright's party with what
the Senator's committee had
perhaps inadvertently dis-
covered.
*
The Senator seems to be
getting his academic cart
before his horse in that he
claimed that his investiga-
tion was to be "education-
al."
What might be the nature
of the "education," it might
be asked? Was it intended
to familiarize the public
with the market so that it
might more fully participate
therein?
If so, why does the Sena-
tor look askance at efforts
of the New York Stock Ex-
change to educate the pub-
lic on its own account?
Was the investigation in-
tended to "educate" the
Senators in general and the
chairman in particular?
If so, why should there
be diversionary enterprises
such as the Galbraith testi-
mony, which turned out to
be a lecture on what the
government ought to do
about margins?
The absurdity of the Fed-
eral government's frown-
ing on brokers' loans is ap-
parent when it is consid-
ered that, according to the
Hoover Commission's latest
report, the Federal govern-
ment is the biggest lender
in the world, with 244 bil-
lion dollars in contingent
liabilities and more going
out all the time.
If the Federal govern-
ment should move to re-
quire 100% margin, there
are plenty of other lenders
who are willing to forward
money on stocks.
There seems to have been
a suggestion in the Ful-
bright committee that
something be done about
the Winchell broadcasts in
which there were sugges-
tions about certain stocks
which resulted in mad
rushes to buy.
â˜…
The idea that "there
ought to be a law" in this
case is about the silliest
thing that has emerged
from this altogether silly in-
vestigation.
I do not happen to agree
with Winchell's methods of
disseminating news, but I
can see no reason why, if
he chooses to present infor-
mation about stocks, he is
doing anything that every
broker and thousands of
people are not doing every
day.
In a free economy there
still must be the right of
people to tell other people
what they think or know,
and there must be full per-
mission for people to invest
their money as they choose.
What Fulbright is per-
mitting in this case is the
staging of a full-dress ex-
ploitation for Mr. Winchell
himself.
If the Democratic major-
ity in Congress can produce
nothing better in the way
of vote bait than this in-
vestigation, it can hardly
expect a vote of confidence
in its judgment.
