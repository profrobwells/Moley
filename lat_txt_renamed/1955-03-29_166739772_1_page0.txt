TAMPA, Fla. â€” Sen.
Byrd's bill of objections to
the Clay highway-building
plan which he presented to
the Committee on Public
Works is a potent document.
It is a pity that the
President failed to take account
of the fallacies and
dangers in the Clay plan
before he gave it even the
qualified endorsement that
he did.
Byrd's three most important
points are that the
plan and the bill embodying
the plan, which is before
the Senate, would permanently
and disastrously
impair Federal budgetary
procedure, Congressional
control of the purse and
debt management; that it
would establish an authoritarian
agency capable of
overriding the States and
making fast and loose with
private property; and that
it would, despite huge out-
lays, produce less highway
mileage over the next 30 or
40 years than the present
system.
*
The Clay plan sets up a
strange corporation without
income or assets, but authorized
to borrow 21 billion dollars
without declaring it to
be a debt. This would be
outside the debt limit which
Congress has wisely imposed.
The interest on the bonds
would amount to $11,500,-
000,000, making the total
cost of the improvement
vastly more than the building
costs.
Budgetary procedure
would be thrown to the
winds, for there would be
permanent, indeterminate
appropriations. The
plan would irrevocably ear-
mark a gasoline tax for a
special purpose, which is a
form of financing frowned
on by all sound fiscal experience.
*
The Clay plan and the
President's comment on it
suggest that both of these
generals were overly impressed
by the German
autobahns, with which they
became familiar in their
service in that country. The
parallel, however, is not
serviceable in this country.
Those highways were
built under ruthless authoritarian
government to serve
military needs. Compared
with our present highway
system, those highways are
small in mileage. According
to my map, they extend
over a distance of somewhat
more than 3000 miles. We
have twice that mileage in
toll roads constructed, under
construction or authorized.
The Clay plan and the
bill before the Senate would
give the new highway authority
almost the power of
a Hitlerian government. It
envisages on the vast network
of interstate highways
rights of way 255 feet wide.
To meet these requirements
it would be necessary
to do one of two
things on thousands of miles
of present highways:
*
First, oust and presumably
pay for countless millions
of dollars in property
along present rights of way,
which serve the traveling
public; or, second, relocate
the highways, thus destroying
the value of such property.
Byrd cites the magnificent
Route 11 highway
through the beautiful Shenandoah
Valley. What Gen.
Sheridan did to that valley
would be mild compared
with what Gen. Clay would
do.
There would be licenses
by the autobahn authority
for filling stations, motels,
restaurants and hot-dog
stands at the discretion of
the authority.
Finally, Byrd makes it
clear that under the strange
financing proposed there
would ultimately be less
money for construction than
under a continuation of the
present system of Federal-
State co-operation.
*
In the first place, $8,500,-
000,000 would be absorbed
by refunds to States which
have already established
great roads. There would be
an $11,500,000,000 interest
charge, which might have
gone for new construction.
Moreover, the plan contemplates
a great burst of
building over 10 years, and
then a period of 22 years to
pay off the debt incurred.
As Byrd says, "It seems to
me fantastic that in this 22-
year period there will be no
need for road development.
The construction of roads is
a continuing process."
Byrd offers in place of
this absurd scheme a simple
three-point plan:
Repeal the Federal gasoline
tax, which would immediately
be taken over by
the States. Continue present
matching with the Federal
government contributing
$535,000,000 a year. Continue
the Federal tax on
lubricating oil.
Thus we would be assured
of continuing progress without
destroying fiscal practices
and with more highways
over the years ahead.
