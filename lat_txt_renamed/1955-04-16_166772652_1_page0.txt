RAYMOND MOLEY:
Stevenson's Position
Is Perilous Alternative
The idea of a titular lead-
er of a party may be taken
with a grain of salt by most
Americans, but it is a reality
to some.
Although the use of the
adjective "titular," indicates
at once that the person was
a victim of a defeat at the
last election, it does not
completely obliterate the
fact that when he speaks
he commands a wide au-
dience and to a degree com-
mits his party to what he
says. Hence, the speech to
a nationwide audience by
Adlai Stevenson has a mean-
ing far beyond the expres-
sions of an individual.
Since this is true, the for-
mer Democratic candidate
is revealing a momentous
degree of courage or, if you
will, foolhardiness in even
partially committing his par-
ty to a policy of peace at a
very considerable price.

American political parties
have been either permanent-
ly extinguished or badly in-
jured by running in the face
of a war that most people
believe to be justified or un-
avoidable. That is the po-
litical side of his statement,
that we should be willing to
trade off Matsu and Quemoy
for the support of various
unnamed allies in defending
Formosa.
Stevenson might answer
to this interpretation that
he did not say exactly that.
So let us see how he man-
aged it.
He said that we should
invite "our friends" to com-
mit themselves to the de-
fense of Formosa "pending
some final settlement of its
status — by independence,
neutralization, trusteeship,
plebiscite or whatever is
wisest."
Then Russia would be in-
vited to declare its position.
Then, since Quemoy and
Matsu would have little im-
portance to the Nationalists,
they could be given up.

This is a perilous position
for a party which is desper-
ately in need of an issue to
fight a campaign against a
President who is presently
enjoying a very considerable
degree of popularity.
But Stevenson might say
that he was not speaking as
a politician seeking an is-
sue, but as an American
seeking a way of extracating
his country from a danger-
ous situation. If so, let us
put politics aside and con-
sider the proposition on the
basis of pure logic and judg-
ment.
The determination of the
United States to see that
Formosa does not fall into
the hands of Communists is
based upon the judgment
that Formosa is essential
to the defense of the United
States. It is not based upon
any concern that a great
majority of "our friends"
may have in the future of
Formosa.
★
Perhaps a secondary con-
sideration is the presence of
Chiang's government in the
United Nations and the ab-
sence of Red China there
from. But to our allies, es-
pecially to our European al-
lies, that is of negligible
importance. I cannot con-
ceive of any of our al-
lies, except those directly
concerned like Australia and
New Zealand, being willing
to give blood and treasure
to prevent the substitution
of one Chinese government
for another in the United
Nations.
It seems quite reasonable
to assume that Stevenson
believes that a great ma-
jority of the American peo-
ple are willing to pay this
price for freedom from the
danger of war.
If he is right in such an
assumption, then a major-
ity must believe that their
judgment as to the defense
of those islands is better
than that of the President.
I cannot believe any such
thing.

Instead, it seems to me
that one reason for the pop-
ularity of Eisenhower is
that people have confidence
in his judgment of what, in
the last analysis, is a mili-
tary matter. It is a military
matter because the decision
whether the islands should
be defended or not depends
upon whether an attack
upon them is really a prel-
ude to an attack upon For-
mosa.
The man in the street
cannot make that decision
wisely, nor can Stevenson,
nor can I.
In such a situation the
decision should be made by
a qualified person in pos-
session of all the facts.
Eisenhower is such a
person, qualified by long
military experience and
equipped with all that the
government can learn.
It is my opinion that the
American people are happy
to have him where he is at
such a time.
