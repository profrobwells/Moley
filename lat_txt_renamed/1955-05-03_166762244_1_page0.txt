HUTCHINS GOES HUNTING FOR FEAR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Give a nosy man with a
passion for publicity $15,-
000,000 to spend and you
have-Dr. Robert M. Hutch-
ins.
His latest crusade is
against newspaper pub-
lishers. He laid something
on the line, before the Amer-
ican Society of Newspaper
Editors at their meetings
in Washington two weeks
ago, but there were various
opinions about what the
something was.
He told the editors that
publishers should not be in
"the driver's seat;" the First
Amendment was intended
to prevent such tyranny,
etc., etc. Also, he said that
the bad publishers had
made the American press a
"one-party affair."
*
And so one editor re-
marked that the next time a
publisher asked him a ques-
tion, he would take the
First Amendment on him.
Apparently Hutchins
would like to create the im-
pression that American edi-
tors are a lot of "wee cower-
in' beasties," with publish-
ers calling all the tune.
Perhaps the next means
of providing gravy for poll-
sters and professors in
search of paid research will
be a survey of fear among
editors. Because there is
one thing sure about Hutch-
ins. He never makes an
Investigation without an-
nouncing the result before-
hand.
That is the way it was
with the $150,000 survey of
fear in the colleges now go-
ing on under the Hutchins-
Ford Fund for the Repub-
lic, which reminds me of
women are cowards and
liars.
But it can be safely
assumed that the governing
group of the Association of
University Professors will
make no protest. They are
too keenly aware of the
value to them of the good
Max Eastman's remark
when he sailed for Russia
in 1922. He said that he
was "going to find out
whether what he had been
saying is true."
Hutchins wrote in the
Bulletin of the American
Association of University
Professors that "education
is impossible in many parts
of the United States today
because free inquiry and
free discussion are impos-
sible." Hence, the deduc-
tion that American profes-
sors are obsessed by fear
and are not teaching the
things they believe.
For a truly sensitive pro-
fession, such a charge
would be regarded as a
grievous insult. For it
maintains that a great
group of generally honest
and self-giving men and
victims. Some two weeks
ago a well-meaning young
lady spent almost three
hours interviewing me,
while others on her 'team'
were spending the same
amount of time at inter-
viewing my departmental
colleagues.
"She refused to allow me
to see the questionnaire but
had it before her and asked
me a large number of
questions, many of which
were simply ridiculous.
*
"I am sure she left my
office considerably disap-
pointed. It so happens that
I am not afraid of anything,
have had no restraints or
restrictions of any kind
placed upon me in any way
by anyone here or else-
where.
"The whole performance
was rather futile and bor-
ing but this does not blind
me to the fact that it was a
great waste of Ford money
"My colleagues and I
thought the entire project
was a waste of time for all
concerned; the questions
seem foolish and indicate
little knowledge of what
actually happens in and
among a university faculty;
and a somewhat obvious
endeavor to ask 'loaded'
questions, implying that
there is fear, intimidation
and confusion in university
faculties. There is evidence,
very slight, of some of these
factors but in my judgment
they are utterly negligible."
