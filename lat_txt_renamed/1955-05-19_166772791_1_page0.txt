LONDON—This is writ-
ten after a visit to War-
wick to hear Prime Minis-
ter Eden's adoption speech
to his contituents, to Bir-
mingham to study the great
Central Conservative Office
there which is responsible
for more than 60 constitu-
encies, and after a visit to
Rugby.
I had at least two reasons
for wanting to visit Rugby.
The first is that the Rugby
seat is in the balance. In
1950 the Labor candidate
had a margin of only 1036
votes, and in 1951 this was
cut to 199. This time the
Conservatives hope to turn
him out.
My other reason for going
to Rugby was quite remote
from politics. I wanted to
see the great Rugby School
which, at the age of 13, I
attended vicariously by
reading, along with prob-
ably a million more Amer-
ican boys, "Tom Brown's
School Days."
★
My first glimpse of school
and playing field reminded
me of the cold autumn eve-
ning made immortal in Mat-
thew Arnold's indescribably
moving tribute to his re-
nowned father, Dr. Thomas
Arnold, in "Rugby Chapel."
It was May this time, but
it was cold and wet under-
foot. In the chapel is a me-
morial to the great head-
master who left a profound
imprint on English educa-
tion.
There was the playing
field mentioned by Matthew
Arnold and overlooking it
a stone with the inscrip-
tion commemorating one
William Webb Ellis, who
in 1823 "with a fine disre-
gard for the rules of foot-
ball as played in his time
first took the ball in his
arms and ran with it," and,
it might have been added,
thus originating one of
America's most profitable
industries.
But there was no disre-
gard of rules at the teem-
ing hive of the Conserva-
tive agent the next day.
Upon that one man falls
the responsibility for see-
ing to it that something is
known and done about
more than 40,000 voters
who will decide whether
Johnson, the Labor mem-
ber, or Soref, the Conserv-
ative candidate, will go to
Whitehall. The candidates
in British constituencies
are passing visitors. But
the agent is permanent. He
is a professional politician
and proud of it.
The Labor Party is short
of agents, largely because
it lacks the funds to support
them. The Conservative
Party not only has twice
as many as Labor but pays
them more.
In either party, they are
dedicated men and women.
Labor agents get about $25
a week. Conservative agents
after some years of experi-
ence get as much as $50 a
week. There is a movement
developing in both parties
to create a real professional
class of agents.
They must take instruc-
tion and pass examinations.
They have their profession-
al associations, and there is
in the Conservative Party
some provision for pension
rights.
The Conservative agent
at Rugby is managing the
affairs of a relative stranger
in the city. For Candidate
Soref tried it in another
place in 1951 but was de-
feated.
★
There are good reasons
why he may be more for-
tunate this time. In the
first place, he can count
upon heavy support from
the high brass of the party.
Since this is so marginal
and so famous a constit-
uency, at least five Cabinet
Ministers will visit it for
speeches. The Prime Minis-
ter has already appeared.
The candidate has the
additional advantage of
the support of a man
named Brown, who repre-
sented Rugby from 1942 to
1950 as an Independent.
The Conservatives, fool-
ishly it seems, ran a candi-
date in 1950 and thus
opened the way to Labor.
But ultimate success will
depend upon the agent,
that unheralded hero of
British politics.
In another article I shall
in more detail describe the
work of the agent in a cam-
paign.
