RAYMOND MOLEY:
Political Agent Gets
Out Vote in Britain
LONDON—In a previous
dispatch I noted that suc-
cess or failure for most
British candidates depends
upon the relatively obscure
agent in the constituency. I
also noted that the agent is
a professional politician and
is proud of it.
The duties of an agent are
innumerable. To perform
them well requires not only
tireless energy but tact, re-
sourcefulness and previous
training. He or she—there
are now a considerable
number of women agents—
must not only originate and
direct a great number of ac-
tivities but keep all within
the law.
And what is equally im-
portant, the agent must live
within the relatively small
amount of money available
and spendable under the
law. To make his task still
more difficult, he must be-
tween elections devise
means of raising that mon-
ey, including in some in-
stances the funds needed to
pay his own meager salary.
He is the hero of this rather
listless campaign.
*
To begin with, he must
operate the all-important
canvass. In most American
Congressional districts it is
literally impossible to make
personal contact with all
the voters, numbering 200,-
000 to 300,000. In a British
constituency the number
of potential voters runs
from 30,000 to 50,000.
The ideal is to reach
every one of these at least
once and some of them
twice. That ideal is not al-
ways attained, but the num-
ber canvassed is very large.
The first canvass must be-
gin as soon as the candidate
has been entered or, as it is
called, “adopted.” On the
official list of eligible voters
the canvasser checks politi-
cal preferences, with dis-
tinctive marks indicating
Conservative, Labor, Lib-
eral or doubtful.
With that done, the main
effort is to get out on elec-
tion day the so-called
pledged vote for the party.
Those who indicate that for
legitimate reasons they can-
not get to the polling place
are helped to cast votes by
mail. All this labor is gen-
erally done by volunteer
workers recruited by the
agent.
But the agent must also
organize publicity—post-
ers, leaflets, and the like.
He must organize meetings
and get speakers for them.
Finally, he must get the
voters who have shown
preference for his party to
the polls. A certain amount
of transportation is allowed
for those who cannot make
it by themselves. This must
be organized by the agent.
Such transportation is
mainly in automobiles
owned by friends of the
party.
★
Between elections the
agent must keep the party
alive. He serves as agent
for the central party
authority in London, but
he is also the secretary of
the local association, which
is a citizen party group.
He must maintain con-
tact with the Member in
Parliament if his party has
one, for just as in the
United States there are in-
numerable problems which
citizens have with govern-
ment. The agent must
handle a lot of these. In so
doing, he must have the
skill of a publicist, a psy-
chologist, a lawyer, and a
businessman.
In the present campaign
the agent has the additional
difficulty of getting volun-
teers in a time of full em-
ployment.
To a large degree the de-
cision this year will depend
upon the percentage of its
own vote that either party
gets out. It is what a Brit-
ish political writer calls
“the battle of the turnout.”
On that basis, the result
should favor the Conserva-
tives. For theirs is the bet-
ter machine. But it would
be rash to make any pre-
dictions, either now or in
any other election.
Among the only Ameri-
cans known in Britain who
predict the future, the
names of Gallup and Billy
Graham stand out. And I
am not in contact with
either.
