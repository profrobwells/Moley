LONDON—My purpose in
coming over here was to see
and report what Americans
might learn to their own
benefit from the manner in
which their British friends
conduct the solemn enter-
prise of self-government. In
summing up my impres-
sions I consider three fac-
tors—the attitudes of the
voters, the reporting of the
campaign by the press, and
the management of the cam-
paign by the parties.
If statistics mean any-
thing, American voters fall
far behind the British in
their interest and participa-
tion in the business of
choosing their government.
In a general election like
this, something like 80% of
the eligible voters vote
either in person or by mail.
The disgraceful American
record is something over
50% in a Presidential elec-
tion and 40% or less in
Congressional elections.

Moreover, the British
voter is not ashamed to de-
clare himself to be a party
man. You hear little of that
talk so common in America
of “voting for the man rath-
er than the party.” The per-
sonalities of candidates
mean very little in most
constituencies. The party is
most important.
Candidates are bound by
party policy, determined on
the Conservative side by
party leaders in Parliament,
and in the Labor Party by
the annual party conference.
The voter who cannot
make up his mind is in the
United States called by the
sweet name “independent.”
Over here he is called “a
floating voter.” This species
is not regarded with great
respect. Indeed, the “float-
er” is a source of merri-
ment.
The reporting of political
news in the British press is
generally unfair, biased, and
in spots scurrilous. In that
respect the American press
is infinitely more sophisti-
cated, informative, and fair.
If Truman and Steven-
son could, as they did, find
fault with the American
press, they should see what
goes on over here. Editori-
alizing in the news is the
rule rather than the excep-
tion. The Manchester
Guardian, which has in the
past been regarded by some
Americans as a model of
journalism, is one of the
worst offenders. The Times
is better, but its American
news is heavily slanted. The
best of the weeklies is the
Sunday Observer, and the
best daily is the Daily Tele-
graph.
The organization of Brit-
ish parties is vastly superi-
or to ours. The Conserva-
tive Party took its defeat in
1945 to heart and com-
pletely reorganized itself.
The Labor Party has less
in the way of organization,
but it has the solid core as
well as the money of the
trade unions to depend up-
on.

A great deal is done in a
constituency by the party
agents with relatively little
money. Most of the detailed
work, of which there is
plenty, is done by volun-
teers. And these volunteers
work without hope of re-
ward or patronage. Party
work goes on the year
around.
It would pay the national
committees of the two
American parties to send
delegations over here to
study what is done to keep
party spirit alive. Because
to a large degree it is or-
ganization rather than can-
didates that consistently
wins elections.
