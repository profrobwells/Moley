THE WATCH
MAKERS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Duff has just re-
leased a very important re-
port of a subcommittee of
the Committee on the
Armed Services concerning
the essentiality of the Amer-
ican watch and clock indus-
try in our defense organiza-
tion. The testimony was
taken by the subcommittee
a year ago.
Witnesses, including rep-
resentatives of the military
services, were unanimous in
support of the industry. No
doubt the President had this
report before him when he
decreed an increase in the
tariff on imported horologi-
cal material to protect the
remaining American compa-
nies.
In most instances it is en-
tirely in line with a free
economy to work toward
the elimination of trade re-
strictions. Other conditions
being equal, American in-
dustry should compete on
equal terms with foreign-
made products. In the case
of the watch and clock in-
dustry, a matter of principle
is at stake as well as a clear
case of military necessity.
*
The principle which dis-
tinguishes this case of pro-
tection is that since govern-
ment arbitrarily destroyed
the competitive position of
the American watch and
clock industry because of
war needs, it has a moral
obligation to permit that in-
dustry to regain its legiti-
mate share of the market.
During World War II,
the American watch
and clock industry was
completely converted to de-
fense production.
According to the sub-
committee's report, "In ad-
dition to the traditional
horological instruments
which it manufactured for
the defense effort, such as
chronometers, chrono-
graphs, navigation watches
and military timepieces of
every description, it also
produced unbelievable
quantities of time fuses for
antiaircraft and artillery
shells, timing mechanisms
for land and sea mines,
altimeters, and a host of
other precision instruments
for ships, tanks, and air-
craft."
After the war three years
were required to reconvert
and get in shape to try to
regain a share of the mar-
ket. Not long after the Ko-
rean war began the indus-
try was again diverted.
*
Meanwhile it lost great
numbers of its skilled work-
ers. The report says that
the number of workers
skilled in manufacturing
jeweled movements
dropped from 8151 in 1951
to 4300 at the present. It
now has only 15% of the
market and must struggle
to keep that. It was this
consideration that induced
the President to provide an
increase in the tariff.
The British learned to
their bitter regret the con-
sequences of losing their
clock and watch industry.
Before the war Hitler, with
deadly intent, flooded the
market and all but de-
stroyed the British indus-
try.
When war came the Unit-
ed States had to supply the
missing components for its
ally. After the war even
such a "liberal" as Sir Staf-
ford Cripps pointed out the
desperate need for the in-
dustry in war. The Labor
government set to work to
re-establish it.

The subcommittee report
points out that the most
serious need is for workers
competent to produce jew-
eled movements.
"The artisans and super-
visory personnel," it says,
"who form the backbone of
the industry must have up
to 10 years of experience
before they become pro-
ficient in their skills."
The instruments in a sin-
gle bomber require more
than 5000 jewel bearings.
In 1941 Germany stopped
any export of Swiss bear-
ings to the United States.
And so we had to do with
what we had and with what
we could produce by train-
ing.
In another war, accord-
ing to the subcommittee, we
simply must not be required
to import these essential
parts. We must make them
here. The necessary skill
to make them must be
found in a healthy Ameri-
can watch and clock indus-
try.
