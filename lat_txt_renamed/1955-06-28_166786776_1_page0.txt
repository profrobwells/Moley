THE RISING MONOPOLY
OF UNION POWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is not without significance that the AFL-CIO
merger was greeted with
hosannas by politicians in
Washington while committees of Congress were making
a great fuss over such
industrial mergers as the
Bethlehem-Youngstown
proposal.
Apparently the monopolistic power of the unions
is a national blessing, while
the companies which must
deal with unions on vital
matters affecting their life
or death should be picked
off like sitting ducks.
After taking its bitter
medicine from the Reuther
union, the Ford Co. pointed
to the helplessness of companies which are being
played against each other
and suggested that the automobile industry collectively
be permitted to bargain
with the industry-wide
UAW-CIO.

Walter Reuther then offered strong objections to
the idea. He said that UAW
would not agree to such
bargaining. It would, he
said, "make small crises
into big ones."
It would seem that the
size of the crisis created by
his demand for a guaranteed
annual wage is just as great
under the present system
of knocking off one company after another as it
would be if they were all
hit together. The time element is all that matters,
and that is not very large.
It was generally believed
months ago that the UAW
had selected Ford as the
spot in the automobile front
in which it intended to
penetrate the industry;
Reuther succeeded, and
now he finds himself able
to pick and choose his
points of attack.
There is some doubt about
the willingness of other automobile companies to
agree to the Ford plan.
Presumably some of the
smaller ones are living in
hope that they can rest
their fate upon the magnanimity of the UAW after it
has won its battle with the
major concerns.

It is reasonable to believe that there are three
possible outcomes of the
present pattern of attack by
the big industry-wide unions.
The first is that in such
agreements as the present
supplemental unemployment
compensation plan,
the companies will join the
unions in putting pressure
on the Federal and State
governments to revamp the
law to take the burden of
such benefits off the companies and place them on
government. The end of
such a road is a corporative state.
Another would be a law
to limit the bargaining to
the specific employee unions in the companies concerned. This would provide
a measure of equality of
power. It would be bitterly
fought and probably could
not get through Congress.

The other outcome may
already be upon us. It is
mergers upon mergers of
companies. This again
would meet opposition by
the political arms of labor
and would no doubt be opposed by the administration in power, Republican
or Democratic, as violative
of the antitrust laws.
The massed power of the
unions has thrown a shadow over the future both of
the economy and of our
form of government itself.
