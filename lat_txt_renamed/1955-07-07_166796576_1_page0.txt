THE PROGRAM AND THE MAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Senate Majority Leader
Lyndon Johnson before his
illness had an interesting
exchange of views with the
President over the respon-
sibility for slow progress
of several administration
measures pending in Con-
gress at this writing.
Americans struggling
with the heat and discom-
fort of summer will not add
this dispute to their wor-
ries. They are used to this
sort of thing. It is the cus-
tomary byplay that at-
tends those periods when
the Congress and the ad-
ministration are respec-
tively controlled by oppos-
ing parties.

The wonder is that sea-
soned politicians are con-
strained to believe that the
public cares much for leg-
islative programs and who
should get credit or blame
for them.
It is true, of course, that
there are sectional concerns
which are affected by this
or that piece of legislation.
For example, the vote of
four Mountain States can
be affected by the Upper
Colorado omnibus measure
because it promises to
bring a lot of Federal
money into their economy.
But a program as a whole,
especially the program that
the President is urging, in
most cases has little to fire
the imagination of people.
Even the famous Roose-
velt program presented to
Congress and passed in
1933 probably had less ef-
fect upon public opinion
than the recovery that set
in after the inauguration of
the President.
In the present instance,
President Eisenhower
names a number of assorted
legislative proposals which
have little of consistency or
of a recognizable philosophy
behind them.
They are, as he states
them, the following: the
Clay highway program,
military reserves, housing,
minimum wage increase
atomic peace ship, Ha-
waiian Statehood, cus-
toms simplification, liberal-
izing the admission of ref-
ugees, Federal aid for
school construction, health,
water resources, and mili-
tary survivors benefits.
Try, if you will, to classi-
fy these and see if a spe-
cific pattern emerges. I don't
believe that it will.
My own classification fol-
lows this order: four are to
provide more Federal
spending, mainly in aid to
States; two are for special
minority groups; one is
strictly of sectional interest:
three are routine matters;
one is foreign aid, presum-
ably classed as belonging to
foreign affairs; and two, Ha-
waiian Statehood and the
atomic peace ship, fall into
no special class.
On some of the foregoing
there is no united Republi-
can support and no con-
sistent Democratic opposi-
tion. On some measures,
like highways, the Demo-
crats have substituted their
own measures. On all there
is no real ideological divi-
sion between the two par-
ties.
*
It will not be a legislative
program that will decide
the election in 1956. It will
be the personality of the
candidates, especially if the
President runs again. And
it is my belief that the
strongest asset the Repub-
licans will have in that case
will be the confidence that
people have in the Presi-
dent in the conduct of for-
eign affairs.
The legislative program
mentioned above will be
dead and forgotten a year
from now.
