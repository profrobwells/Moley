RAYMOND MOLEY:
Federal-State Powers
Defined by New Study
The Commission on Inter-
governmental Relations has
suffered from several handi-
caps which may impair the
usefulness of the very fine
report which it has just
submitted to the President
and Congress.
In the first place, the
work of this commission
had hardly got under way
when, for reasons which
are capable of various in-
terpretations (none of
which is completely satis-
fying), the President exact-
ed the resignation of its
chairman, the distinguished
but controversial Clarence
Manion.
This action drew the fire
of conservative Republi-
cans and all but destroyed
their interest in the very
important task which Con-
gress has imposed upon the
commission.

A minor handicap has
been its long name, which
for most people is meaning-
less.
Another handicap has
been its excessive and un-
wieldy size and, to be bru-
tally frank, the limited dis-
tinction and capacity of
most of its members and
the wide disparity in points
of view which they repre-
sent.
It has been seriously
handicapped by the fact
that at least two of its mem-
bers, Sens. Morse and
Humphrey, have no sym-
pathy at all with the pur-
pose of the commission.
Speaking in Des Moines
during his campaign for
President, Eisenhower
pointed to the immense
growth of the Federal estab-
lishment and of Federal
power through the taking
over of functions tradition-
ally belonging to the States.
He said that the way to re-
turn some of those powers
and activities to the States
would be to return some of
the tax sources to the States.
In his message recom-
mending the creation of this
commission, he stressed the
need for the elimination of
"overlapping" activi-
ties rather than for reform
in the tax structure.
The act of Congress
creating the commission
seemed to give it two re-
lated functions—(a) to
consider the programs of
Federal aid to the States
with a view to limiting
them, and (b) to examine
the capacity of the States
to finance new activities in
case they should be re-
turned by the Federal gov-
ernment.
The report reflects a mild
effort to meet these prob-
lems. It points out that
while the States should as-
sume more of the activities
that formerly belonged to
them, their capacity to do
so under their present tax
laws is limited.
This lack of capacity is
due to three factors—
first, that the States have
been getting a smaller and
smaller cut of the national
tax dollar; second, that the
States have imposed limi-
tations upon themselves by
restrictive provisions in the
State constitutions and in
other ways, and, finally, the
States already have many
sources of revenue open to
them which they have not
used.
★
On two of the more prac-
tical issues in this field—
schools and highways—it
would seem that the com-
mission cautiously moves
toward State sovereignty.
Generally it says the sup-
port and control of schools
is a State function, but
where there is a "clear fac-
tual finding of need and lack
of resources" the Federal
government might help in
school construction. How-
ever, it should avoid inter-
ference in the educational
process itself.
The report recommends
a continuation of some Fed-
eral aid in highway con-
struction, but points out
that the States and local
agencies should do the ac-
tual building. Also, so far
as possible, the construction
of highways should be on a
pay-as-you-go basis.
