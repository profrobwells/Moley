OTTAWA—The blood
and brains of generations
of English-speaking people
have been freely spent to
provide a form of govern-
ment which not only pro-
tects the rights of free men
but contrives somehow to
get the business of govern-
ment done with tolerable
efficiency.
Occasionally liberty
clashes with efficiency, and
except in times of great
national danger, the latter
must yield.
However, it is not always
easy to determine whether
an emergency really exists.
The Canadian House of
Commons as I have watched
it this week seems to be
wrestling with that very
problem.
*
The Liberal government
under Prime Minister
George St. Laurient has
brought in a bill which
would continue indefinitely
the war powers exercised
by Minister of Defense Pro-
duction C. D. Howe.
This Liberal government
has 171 seats in the House,
while the official opposition,
the Progressive Conserva-
tives, has only 51. But un-
der the leadership of George
Drew, that opposition is
showing an amazing capac-
ity to delay action on this
grant of powers.
It has for two weeks been
conducting what the Liber-
als call a filibuster and what
the Progressive Conserva-
tives call a legitimate effort
to prevent an unnecessary
enlargement of the powers
of government over the eco-
nomic life of the nation.
A debate of this kind
differs in a marked degree
from filibusters in our Sen-
ate.
*
To begin with, the two
contending sides are under
the strict control and direc-
tion of the two responsible
heads of the two national
parties—in this case Messrs.
St. Laurient and Drew.
The men who propose to
administer the laws under
consideration are sitting
there opposite their politi-
cal opponents.
Palpably frivolous debate
is prevented not only by
the rules but by the strict
application of the rules by
the powerful Speaker.
A Wayne Morse or a
Huey Long could never
flourish in a British Parlia-
ment because he would be
subject, first, to the rules;
next, to the party leader,
and, above all, to the Speak-
er.
Nevertheless, amusing by-
plays occur in which a ten-
dency to wander from the
subject brings the digni-
fied Speaker to his feet with
reproof. I listened to a
speech by Drew on the de-
fense bill which ran well
over four hours, which some
said was a record in this
House. There were, of
course, constant interrup-
tions.
*
At one point Drew made
some reference to war and
expressed a doubt whether
Howe had the advantage of
close knowledge of battle.
Thereupon a Liberal Minis-
ter shouted that Howe had
a helluva lot more experi-
ence the rest was
drowned by loud pounding
of desks by members, their
traditional manner of ap-
plause.
Drew said something
which even the Speaker mis-
took for a demand to ex-
punge those offensive words
from the record. Drew said
that far from wanting the
words stricken, he want-
ed them to stay in order to
show the character of the
defense of the government
of their bill.
*
In the course of the ex-
changes that followed, the
black-robed, dignified Speak-
er, Louis Rene Beaudoin,
found himself compelled to
use the awful word him-
self.
To this American observ-
er it would seem that the
Liberals forsook their own
principles by insisting upon
the bill. For it would au-
thorize the Defense Minis-
ter to commandeer supplies
and services, force com-
panies to accept contracts
at prices fixed by him, or
take over any plant.
Unlike the original law
passed in 1950, this one
would have no termination
date. The argument of Drew
and his colleagues is that if
powers are for an emer-
gency, they should be limit-
ed in time.
This in itself is good lib-
eral doctrine, and it is
strange to find a party with
the official name "Liberal"
denying it.
