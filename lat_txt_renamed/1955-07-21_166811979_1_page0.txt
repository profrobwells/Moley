RIPON, Wis.—This city
enjoys a singular fame be-
cause it is the birthplace of
the Republican Party.
But it has other claims
upon the attention of the
American people. Ten years
before a group of embattled
people cut loose from old
political parties here in
1854, an early experiment
in Franco-American Com-
munism was established.
The Allah of this economic
religion was Charles Fou-
rier and its prophet was a
strangely interesting char-
acter named Warren Chase.
The Communistic theories
of Fourier had a great vogue
among the eggheads of the
1840s. They were ardently
preached by Horace Greeley
and Albert Brisbane in the
New York Tribune.
Chase and some other
zealots in the town that is
now Kenosha drew up plans
and recruited members for
a sort of corporate body
whose purposes and activi-
ties should follow as closely
as possible the prescription
of Fourier. In practice this
meant that those who joined
put in their money and re-
ceived shares of stock in
what was called a phalanx.
The articles of associa-
tion, which were not made
into a legal corporation un-
til two or three years later,
stated as the purposes of
the organization some lan-
guage borrowed from the
Preamble to the Constitu-
tion of the United States.
But in that borrowing, the
words "general welfare"
were changed to "common
welfare," and the word "lib-
erty" became "social happi-
ness." And so the company
marched away and settled
in a spot in what is now the
city of Ripon.
It is noteworthy that
these seekers of communal
security chose a low pro-
tected area for their settle-
ment and that the freemen
who followed later chose
the elevated sites. The pha-
lanx ate, lived and worked
communally, and the prof-
its were equitably divided.
There was a hocus-pocus
about "units" of credit for
work. The place was called
Ceresco, literally meaning
"grain company."
But in this paradise there
were human characteristics
which doomed it to failure
—some bad and the others
good. There was cheating of
a most unangelic character
in the records of work done,
and there were jealousy and
gossip. There were also the
inherent restless spirit of
liberty and the desire to
own property individually.
Perhaps the phalanx made
its greatest mistake in allow-
ing the brothers and sisters
to have horses, because with
these means of transporta-
tion they were able to get
out of the community and
see more fortunate freemen
in the neighboring country-
side. Then people who did
not like to eat at the com-
mon table got permission to
eat in their own apartments.
Liberty might be crossed off
the articles of community
living, but it could not be
eradicated from the in-
stincts of men.
However, the reports writ-
ten by Comrade Chase had
glowing accounts of the
prosperity of the colony in
the years 1845, 1846, 1847,
and 1848. Also Horace Gree-
ley's reporters, sent out to
write articles about Ceresco,
produced rhapsodies which
no doubt pleased their ec-
centric boss and got them
salary raises.
But somehow the figures
persisted in telling the
truth. When unhappy deni-
zens asked for their money
back in exchange for their
stock, the till was found to
be empty. And so paradise
took to deficit financing. The
new members who came in
were inferior to the free-
dom-loving people who left.
Also, the total number of
angels declined.
Finally, the whole thing
collapsed in 1849-50. Chase,
still a zealot, turned from
the promotion of Commu-
nism to mesmerism and
went into other States. His
autobiography, "The Life
Line of the Lone One,"
portrays the character of a
mystic wandering from il-
lusion to illusion. It was in
the midst of the sorry aches
of Communism that the new
Republican Party took root.
