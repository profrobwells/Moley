CALGARY, Alberta — In
a previous article I de-
scribed the wide disparity
between the Socialistic
promises of the Co-operative
Commonwealth Federa-
tion and the small progress
it has made after 11 years
in power over Saskatche-
wan.
*
One of the reasons for
this is the fact that the
visionaries who take over
in such a movement are not
only impractical in putting
their own theories into ef-
fect, but in their dream-
ing they neglect or make a
mess of the traditional and
indispensable responsibili-
ties of government. High
among such indispensables
are the building and main-
tenance of roads and high-
ways.
From the moment I en-
tered Saskatchewan from
North Dakota the condition
of the highways command-
ed attention. Therefore, in
planning to drive from.
Regina to Calgary I was
advised to stop over at
Medicine Hat, Alberta. The
distance from Regina to
Medicine Hat is about 325
miles on the long — I can-
not say great — transcon-
tinental highway No. 1.
I then consulted the local
office of the automobile
club about the condition of
that highway. The report
was not reassuring, and the
suggestion was made "to
take No. 6 and No. 2." I
examined the map and
could find no articulation
between Saskatchewan's 2
and 6.
I called the club again
and was told that the No. 2
in question was in the
United States. In some
bewilderment I pressed the
question and was as-
sured that the advice was
to get to Medicine Hat by
returning to No. 2 in Mon-
tana and then, at Havre
in that State, to turn north
to Medicine Hat. In other
words, the transcontinental
highway was so bad that it
was advisable to travel
something like 625 miles to
achieve 325 miles. This, I
felt, was a truly Marxian ac-
complishment.
I decided to try the trans-
continental highway just to
see for myself what the CCF
government was doing in
road construction. It cer-
tainly was knowledge bit-
terly acquired. I have
traveled by automobile
tens of thousands of miles
in the last 10 years and have
sampled most of the roads
from San Antonio to Riviere
du Loup, Quebec, and from
Miami to Seattle, but never
on the North American
continent have I seen and
felt such terrible roads and
highways as exist in that
great Socialist experiment.

I was told by Saskatche-
wan's Prime Minister Doug-
las that the CCF was in the
beginning inspired by our
American Patrons of Indus-
try and the Minnesota
Farmer Labor Party which
infested our Northwest in
the 1920s. He himself got
his knowledge and inspira-
tion at the University of
Chicago and from Gov.
Floyd Olson's preaching in
Minnesota 25 years ago.
Perhaps in the light of
this, it ill becomes a citizen
of the United States to offer
criticism. But there are
bright spots in this Cana-
dian Northwest, and in an-
other article or two I shall
tell about the radicals who
turned conservative here in
Alberta.
