TALBOTT AND THE TEAM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It can be asserted with
assurance that the attack
upon Harold Talbott, Sec-
retary of the Air Force, was
politically inspired. Had
there been no election in
the offing, the matter would
not have been exploited.
It can also be asserted
that if nothing more serious
than is now known was
done by Talbott in behalf
of private interests, he
stands guilty of nothing
more than an indiscretion.
He had the assurance of
a Senate committee that
he might keep his member-
ship in the Mulligan firm.
Soliciting business for that
company while in office was
hardly a violation of the
letter of the law.
But to establish the fact
that no law was violated
and that politics inspired
the attack does not dismiss
the responsibility of Tal-
bott. For a public official in
a free government owes a
double obligation, first to
the public interest and
next, to his party.

There is nothing repre-
hensible about the fact
that political motives in-
spired this attack or in the
fact that Talbott and every-
one else appointed by Pres-
ident Eisenhower owes an
obligation to the Republi-
can Party.
The interests of everyone
in the nation depend upon
the vigilance of a political
opposition. It is written in
the laws of nature and the
book of experience that
human beings of all sorts
bear a bit of watching. And
in a vast government like
ours, the Congressional op-
position is in a position to
perform that service.
The fact that the opposi-
tion does it for selfish pur-
poses does not minimize its
service. Even the police-
man who guards your
house while you sleep has
a selfish interest in being
on the force.
Moreover, the obligation
of a man like Talbott to his
party's interests is a very
serious matter. Tens of
thousands of people labored
long hours in 1952 to get
out the vote for Eisenhower.
Most of them did what they
did without hope of personal
gain. Certainly only a tiny
minority of them were
rewarded with jobs in the
government.
Those who did get those
jobs, from the President
down, owe it to those who
worked and those who vot-
ed to do nothing to give
campaign material to the
opposition.
A political party is a
team, no member of which
has a right to endanger its
interests.

Perhaps as a businessman
Talbott felt that, since a
Senate committee told him
he could keep his connection
with the Mulligan firm, this
assurance was all he needed
in case somebody in the
opposition began to ask
hostile questions. But what
is a safe assurance in
private business is not
necessarily safety in public
office.
The vast public with
which both parties are
concerned is not moved by
the logic that prevails in a
corporation's board of
directors. It lives to a
degree on rumors, preju-
dices, envy and suspicion.
In geometry, the square
of the hypotenuse of a
right-angled triangle is the
sum of the squares of its
legs. But in politics it de-
pends upon how the public
looks at it.
The sooner that business-
men generally realize this,
the better the nation will be
served. For businessmen
have a great contribution to
make in government, pro-
vided they learn the politi-
cal facts of life.
