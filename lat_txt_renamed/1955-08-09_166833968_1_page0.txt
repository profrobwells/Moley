CONGRESS SUMS UP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This session of Congress,
the last before a big elec-
tion year, ended on a quiet
but, when all things are
considered, a positive note.
The legislative branch of
government did most of its
routine well and indicated
good judgment in what it
rejected. For this, it is im-
possible to assign political
credit. On most major de-
cisions the vote was far
from a straight party affair.
As in past years, the
House proved to be more
economical than the Sen-
ate. It also indicated a
greater regard for the tax-
payer's interests in its ac-
tions than the President
manifested in his requests.
*
The President was given
substantially what he want-
ed in appropriations for de-
fense and foreign aid. But
his domestic program was
in the main rejected.
High on his list of re-
quests were a highway plan,
his school-building program,
and the Upper Colorado
project. An examination of
these would indicate that
the President can blame no
one except his advisers for
their loss. He was badly
served in all three in-
stances.
He placed the responsibil-
ity for creating a highway
program upon a committee
headed by Gen. Clay, who,
despite his distinction as an
administrator in Germany,
knew less of American
highways than many an-
other engineer who could
have been selected.
*
The Clay plan was an en-
gineering oddity and a fis-
cal monstrosity. In the name
of defense it proposed a vast
network of highways, some
of which would supersede
perfectly adequate existing
routes and others would be
altogether unnecessary to
accommodate present or any
probable future traffic loads.
The method proposed by
the Clay committee for pay-
ing the Federal contribu-
tion to this gigantic build-
ing plan would create a
Federal obligation while
pretending not to create a
Federal debt. This plan was
doomed from the moment
that Sen. Byrd pointed out
its defects.
The Gore plan which the
Democrats proposed in its
place would have provided
for great Federal expendi-
tures and more Federal
taxes. The House wisely
junked both plans. Neither
could be justified on the
grounds of defense or emer-
gency.
*
Nor was there any emer-
gency in school construc-
tion. The figures which the
President was induced to
mention in his message on
the subject were proved to
be grossly in error. Neither
house was disposed to ac-
cept any part of the scheme.
The great Upper Colora-
do storage project was a
victim of the voracity of its
proponents.
Instead of resting con-
tent with the plan as it was
proposed in 1954 by the
President and the Interior
Department, the Senate
committee increased the
number of irrigation proj-
ects from 11 to 33 and the
estimated cost by several
hundred million.
The House committee re-
ported out a short version
which was merely a trick to
get the plan through the
House, after which the Sen-
ate version or a great part
thereof would be taken in
conference.
*
Both Democratic and Re-
publican leadership found
that, if carried to the floor,
the bill would die, and so
it was passed over for the
session.
A wise member of the
House commented in the
course of the last month
that he has found a new
spirit of caution among his
colleagues. This is no doubt
due to the fact that mem-
bers from the States which
must shoulder the main
burden of Federal taxes are
beginning to hear com-
plaints from home.
The people and the news-
papers of Pennsylvania
could hardly enjoy the pros-
pect that before the Upper
Colorado region would be
thoroughly dammed and
watered they could con-
tribute something like
$250,000,000 of the cost.
Perhaps, after all, Con-
gress is finding that spend-
ing is not always the best
politics.
