FEDERAL DEBT AND STATE SCHOOLS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Once more, at the 47th
annual Governors Confer-
ence at Chicago, there have
been speeches about the
rights and duties of the
States in our republic that
should be heeded by all
members of Congress who
are asked every year to pro-
vide everything for the
American people from
toothpicks to highways.
These sentiments might
also he heeded by President
Eisenhower and his advis-
ers who proposed in their
highway and school pro-
grams, fortunately without
results, one of the greatest
expansions of Federal aid
in 50 years.
For the twin reasons that
deficit financing looks like
something that doesn't have
to be paid for and also that
Federal expenditures do not
come as closely under the
scrutiny of people in the
States and local communi-
ties, and is has been the
fashion for half a century to
expand Federal grants-in-
aid.
One of the outstanding
exponents among State Gov-
ernors during the three
terms he has served his
State of Washington has
been Arthur B. Langlie. His
views on the subject of
State responsibilities were
made known two weeks be-
fore the Governors Confer-
ence, before the National
Municipal League.
He reminded his hearers,
with plenty of evidence to
support him, that there is
no reason why such im-
provements as highways
and schools should not be
financed by the State and
local governments. He
pointed out that in 1932 the
gross Federal debt equaled
20% of the national income,
while the combined State
and local debt was about
the same.
In 1954, the Federal debt
had jumped to 98% of the
national income, while the
State and local debt dropped
to 12%.
Interest on the Federal
debt is 10% of the total ex-
penditures of the Federal
government. Interest on
State and local debt is only
1% of State expenditures,
while it is only 3% of local
expenditures.
Meanwhile State and lo-
cal governments have been
buying plenty of Federal
bonds. All this, Langlie says,
would indicate that State
and local governments "are
in a better position to take
on new responsibilities than
the debt-ridden Federal
government."

It is not without signifi-
cance that Roger A. Free-
man, who is Gov. Langlie's
special assistant, worked
under the chairmanship of
Adam S. Bennion on the
task force report on educa-
tion for the Commission on
Intergovernmental Rela-
tions. That report is one
reason why many mem-
bers of Congress at the re-
cent session decided that
action on a Federal school
building program was not
necessary, despite the urg-
ing of the administration.
This report was the first
thorough study of Ameri-
can elementary and second-
ary education in 16 years.
Freeman presented his own
views in convincing detail
before the House Education
and Labor Committee.
It is most significant that
the educational journals
have seemingly ignored
this study and Freeman's
testimony. This may well
be because schoolmen and
schoolmen's organizations
have been offering the pub-
lic a lot of nonsense con-
cerning the necessity for
more and more Federal aid.
These schoolmen have ap-
parently forgotten that a
part of their duty, beyond
getting bigger and more el-
egant schools at Federal ex-
pense, is to teach a new
generation the essentials of
American constitutional
government.

We wonder how sharp
their emphasis has been on
the fundamentals written
into the Constitution con-
cerning State responsibili-
ties and Federal limita-
tions.
We wonder, too, whether
such indisputable economic
facts as have been present-
ed in the Bennion-Freeman
report will ever reach the
classrooms of the nation.
