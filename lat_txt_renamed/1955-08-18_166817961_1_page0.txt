RAYMOND MOLEY:
An Echo of Morse
In Democratic Smear
Apparently the Demo-
cratic Party didn't take
Sen. Wayne Morse to its
bosom. Morse took the
Democratic Party to his
bosom.
For more and more the
official propaganda of the
party takes its text and
supporting data from the
torrential speeches of the
Oregon magpie. The latest
evidence is in the Demo-
cratic Digest which not only
charges that the Hoover
Commission not only ex-
ceeded its authority but
that the task force on wa-
ter and power was "packed"
because it failed to include
in its membership members
of the public power bloc.
Let us examine the ques-
tion whether the commis-
sion actually did exceed its
authority.
*
Both commissions were
established by Republican
Congresses, the first by the
80th and the second by the
82nd. However, at the time
when the first was created
there was a Democratic ad-
ministration in power and
it seemed wise to limit the
authority of the commis-
sion to a study of how the
existing activities of the ex-
ecutive department might
be more efficiently per-
formed.
It was barred from pass-
ing judgment on whether
activities should be vested
in government at all. It was
in short concerned with
method and procedures, not
policy. Its concern was with
the how not the why.
The second commission
which completed its job on
June 30 was created by a
Republican Congress dur-
ing a Republican adminis-
tration. It therefore could
count upon, or it had rea-
son to believe that it could
count upon the full co-op-
eration of the administra-
tion in efforts to abolish
activities, not merely to
make them more efficient.
*
Under the terms of the
act creating the commis-
sion it was declared "to be
the policy of Congress to
promote economy, efficien-
cy and improved service"
in government by seven
specified methods.
Among these seven spec-
ified methods are two that
definitely authorize the
commission to enter the
field of policy. They are:
"abolishing services, activi-
ties and functions not nec-
essary to the efficient con-
duct of government; elim-
inating nonessential servic-
es, functions and activities
which are competitive with
private enterprise."
If these directives do not
authorize the commission
to consider and if necessary
to recommend the elimina-
tion of anything which the
executive department is
now required to do from
maintaining a Navy to the
operation of a fishhook fac-
tory then the English lan-
guage has lost its meaning.
Task forces were created
by this commission as they
were by the earlier commis-
sion to explore certain fields
of government, to gather
facts and to make recom-
mendations to the entire
commission.
★
They were not created as
debating societies as would
have been the case with
public power zealots on the
task force on water and
power. Its job was to look
into the activities of govern-
ment in the field and to see
whether some of the burden
of government activities
could be properly shifted
to private agencies and
whether some of the great
cost of government projects
could not properly and safe-
ly be paid for out of pri-
vate funds.
It did its job thoroughly
and submitted a report in
three volumes comprising
in all 1783 pages. Hoover
himself with his own hands
labored for the greater part
of a month reducing this
long report to something
over 100 pages.
The commission-or such
members as were able to
attend meetings— consid-
ered this draft, revised it to
suit a majority and then
passed it. It is very impor-
tant to note that in its final
passage it was supported by
Democratic members of the
commission. Therefore
when the Democratic Digest
is smearing the commission
report it is hitting distin-
guished members of its par-
ty such as Sen. McClellan
and Joseph P. Kennedy,
who was Roosevelt's Am-
bassador to Great Britain.
A careful examination of
the report and recommen-
dations show that the com-
mission followed fairly well
the various actions and
statements of the President
himself in the field of elec-
tric power.
*
The President once used
the term "creeping Social-
ism" in connection with
Federal power. The com-
mission was less strong in
its characterization but it
did emphasize the need to
limit its competition with
private.
The commission heartily
endorsed the President's
partnership policy. It held
with the President that ex-
isting projects not be sold.
And both stressed that the
TVA issue its own securi-
ties.
Any attempt to separate
the President and the for-
mer President on the basis
of this report is running
against the plain record.
