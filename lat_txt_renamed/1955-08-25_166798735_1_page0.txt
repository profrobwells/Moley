THE FIGHT FOR WATER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may divert the minds
of eastern readers of this
article from their recent
struggle to live with their
rivers to read something
about people who have
to live without rivers. For
there is no river between
San Francisco and San
Diego that flows into the
ocean the whole year round.
Before the white man
came to Southern Califor-
nia, from the Tehachapi
Mountains south was a
parched area of mountains
and mountain valleys in
the west and a burning
desert in the east. The In-
dians lived on fish plus
some crops harvested from
crude irrigation or nooks
under the hills.
Until the 20th century
white men lived on the
water they caught off the
mountains and stored in
reservoirs, or which they
extracted from the store
Mother Nature had depos-
ited under the ground over
the centuries.

By 1900 it became appar-
ent to wise people in Los
Angeles that they had a big
city in the making and that
bold steps would be neces-
sary to supplement existing
supplies of water. So in
1907 bonds were issued
for an aqueduct to bring
water from the Owens Val-
ley east of the High Sierra.
That project was one of
the marvels of the time. But
within 20 years the old
worry revived and the com-
munities in the south or-
ganized the Metropolitan
Water District to build
another aqueduct, this time
to the Colorado River more
than 200 miles from Los An-
geles.
The district, which now
includes 66 cities in five im-
mense counties, spent $270,-
000,000 and is now invest-
ing another $75,000,000 in
that project. Not one dollar
of this or of the money used
for the Owens Valley proj-
ect came from the Federal
government.
But the area is still draw-
ing new people at an almost
alarming rate. A recital of
its growth and size is an ex-
ercise in superlatives. There
are 6,000,000 living in the
area now, with all the visi-
tors in addition. Every year
there come as many as live
in Omaha or Providence or
Dayton. In the 1970s there
will probably be 10,000,000.
Whenever I see these
teeming communities I
draw a breath of apprehen-
sion. There is no water in
sight except what they are
using and the salty mass
of the ocean. Surely there
must be enough, because
the people who know are
not worried.
★
The water these people
live on comes from four
sources: There are the un-
derground supplies, ac-
counting for 54% of what is
used; mountain reservoirs
which catch water from
melting snow or the occa-
sional rains provide 15%;
the Owens aqueduct brings
20%, and the remaining
11% is taken from the
Colorado River aqueduct.
But there is a constant
drain on the underground
supply amounting to 300,-
000 acre-feet every year.
The level of that source is
sinking lower and lower.
But to provide for the
increased demand over the
next two or more decades,
there is a potential of 1,-
180,000 acre-feet annually
from the Colorado which is
not being used. There is
also the possibility that wa-
ter used on land in irriga-
tion can be cut back.
★
Some people are reach-
ing the conclusion that,
just as in the laws of Ham-
murabi in ancient times,
there must come here a
priority of men over crops.
Water is getting to be too
valuable to be used in rais-
ing food, however luscious
the product.
But another big supply is
in sight which, like the
two aqueducts, will take a
lot of California money. It
is the proposed and par-
tially planned diversion
from the rushing Feather
River far to the north. This
project I shall describe in
another article.
