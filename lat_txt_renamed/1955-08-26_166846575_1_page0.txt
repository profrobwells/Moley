FOR A THIRSTY LAND
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In a boastful moment a
member of the U.S. Bu-
reau of Reclamation said
that he and his colleagues
enjoyed "pushing rivers
around."

Unlike the bureaucrats
who redirect rivers for the
joy of it and at other peo-
ple's expense, the people of
Southern California are
driven to the task by neces-
sity, and at their own ex-
pense.

The first stream that was
commandeered for the con-
sumption of a thirsty com-
munity was the Owens
River far to the north and
east of Los Angeles. That
was planned and started
nearly 50 years ago.

*

Twenty years later Los
Angeles, built in what was
close to a desert, was again
cramped for moisture and
the great aqueduct from the
Colorado River was created.

Now, with not much more
than 20 years' assurance of
a water supply, Southern
California is planning to
reach far to the north and
bring down water from the
Feather River.

Neither the Owens nor
the Colorado projects were
built at Federal expense,
and the communities of
Southern California plan to
pay for the new Feather
River project also. It will
cost a lot of money.

Presently estimates put
the figure at $1,500,000,000.
But with 10,000,000 people
in the area south of the
Tehachapi Mountains by
1975 the water will not only
be necessary but within
their means.

The Feather River is a
lively stream which comes
down from the Sierras
roughly 75 miles north of
Sacramento. An immense
dam at Oroville would store
3,500,000 acre-feet.

From that reservoir a
series of canals, tunnels and
lifts would bring water all
the way to San Diego. The
total length of the planned
aqueduct would be 567
miles.

Several areas on the way
south would be assigned
water supplies, including
the Feather River area it-
self, Santa Clara and Ala-
meda County (of which the
city of Oakland is a part),
Ventura and Santa Bar-
bara, a part of the Mojave
Desert region and, finally
and mostly, Southern Cali-
fornia.

The State would build
and pay for and own the
aqueduct, but the benefit-
ed communities would pay
for the water under con-
tracts similar to those which
guaranteed the Federal
government's investment in
the Hoover Dam.

The California State En-
gineer has made plans
which are subject to fur-
ther and considerable
amendment. His problem
is to fashion the course of
the aqueduct so that there
will be a minimum of lift-
ing operations.

★

In order to get water
through the mountains
that lie between the coast
area and the source of the
water at the north there is
a problem of elevating the
water something like 3500
feet. In such operations as
this, lifting the water con-
stitutes an immense annual
expense.

This would make the
cost of the water $50 per
acre-foot, much more than
any supplies already avail-
able.

According to Samuel B.
Morris, general manager of
the Los Angeles Depart-
ment of Water and Power,
the amount available for
the coastal area between
Los Angeles and San Diego
from present sources is
enough for an estimated
8,000,000 people, which is
2,000,000 more than at
present. If and when more
people come in there would
have to be a sharp curtail-
ment of the water used in
agriculture.

★

But with the Feather
River water all prospec-
tive needs would be met
until the year 2000.

Beyond that, it is likely
that other chief engineers
and general managers and
Mayors will have to do the
worrying.

Perhaps by that time the
sea can be rid of its salt.
Even that is more likely
than that people will stop
moving to Southern Cali-
fornia.
