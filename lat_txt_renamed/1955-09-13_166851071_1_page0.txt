Political speeches over
Labor Day, notably ex-
President Truman's Detroit
utterance, reflect the vast
change that has taken place
in the Democratic Party
since pre-Roosevelt days.
It is difficult to believe
that the former President
himself realizes the long-
term significance of the al-
teration in strategy which
his own speeches do so
much to promote. For after
all, the man from Independ-
ence was raised in the old
traditions of the Democrat-
ic Party.
In that tradition there
was plenty of denunciation
of Wall St. and of big busi-
ness, but beneath those
catch words of politics was
a broad appeal to all classes
and interests.

While Bryan was flailing
bankers and money chang-
ers, eastern and southern
Democrats were telling vot-
ers how much they intend-
ed to do for business.
Labor was given about
the same laudatory treat-
ment as it received from
Republicans. Labor lead-
ers like Gompers held firm-
ly to a nonparty stand.
In short, the Democratic
Party as well as its rival
sought to show that it
transcended class and en-
compassed all interests.
This generalized appeal
encouraged some people to
say that the two parties
were exactly alike, but it
had the great virtue of per-
mitting all interests and
classes to believe they had
something in common and
that there was a great
American interest over all
little interests.
*
That appeal to a general
interest still remains the
safest and the most per-
manently desirable party
strategy. It may also prove
to be the best politics. For
appeal to class divides not
only the people of the na-
tion but it ultimately di-
vides the party.
The old tradition which
stressed what the classes
and interests had in com-
mon is now supplanted by
stress upon what those
classes and interests do not
have in common. Indeed,
the stress is on their dif-
ferences rather than their
samenesses. It underlines
what they have to gain by
strife rather than what
they can gain by co-opera-
tion.
It is quite clear that un-
der the astute management
of Reuther and Kroll the
class struggle is to be their
order of the day. And Tru-
man, whether he realizes it
or not, is becoming the
chief trumpeter of the new
rule of the classes.
In Detroit he hailed the
union of the AFL and CIO
not as a means by which la-
bor peace might be promot-
ed to the benefit of all
classes but as something
that is "scaring the day-
lights out of the Republi-
cans."
The union of the two
great federations is viewed
as exactly what Reuther
planned it to beâ€”the con-
solidation of the political
arms of both and the pool-
ing of the immense material
resources available to elect
Democrats favorable to the
demands of the labor high
command.
This leaves the Republi-
can Party only one practi-
cal alternative. It must
make its appeal to the forc-
es and interests of unity. It
must do this if it is to suc-
ceed against the immense
resources which the politi-
cal arms of labor can throw
against it.
*
It must appeal to the in-
dividual as an individual,
not as a mere member of a
class. And it must appeal to
the worker as a member of
the community, an owner
of property and a free citi-
zen, over the heads of the
labor leaders who in the
last analysis see him only
as another dollar in the un-
ion political fund and an-
other vote on election day.
The Republican Party is
faced with the situation
created for the Conserva-
tives of Britain after their
great defeat in 1945. They
faced a party frankly based
upon class solidarity. They
rebuilt their organization
and their philosophy on the
principle of British inter-
ests rather than labor or
capital or any other in-
terest or lesser combination
of interests.
It was a long, hard task,
but in the long run it suc-
ceeded.
