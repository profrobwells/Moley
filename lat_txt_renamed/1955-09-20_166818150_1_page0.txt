PROFESSORS AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It probably ill becomes a
person who recruited and
directed the so-called brain
trust of the early Roosevelt
days to offer any reserva-
tions about the usefulness
of what have since come to
be called "Eggheads.". But
at least my knowledge of
that strange group under
Roosevelt is firsthand. It is
no theoretical estimate. And
I trust it is unprejudiced.
My reference to the sub-
ject in this piece is prompt-
ed by two items in the
morning paper. The one
tells that in his vigorous
reorganization of the work
of the Republican National
Committee, Chairman Hall
is planning a much more ex-
tensive use of "people in
universities and else-
where" who can write and
make more clear to the
public what the Republican
Party stands for.

I wish the chairman well
in his quest, although he
will find, as I found in 1932,
that to find a person who
not only knows something
but who can express what
he knows is a not-too com-
mon coincidence.
The other item in the pa-
per to which I have referred
says that the Liberal Party
of New York State has
chosen three professors as
chairmen and vice-chair-
men. The chairman is to be
George Counts, who in odd
moments used to teach
something about education
at Teacher's College. The
House of Representatives
for seven terms.
There is a great diference
between a man with real
brains and a person who
likes to call himself an "in-
tellectual."
The man with the real di-
POLITICAL HDOTRS.
vice-chairmen are a profes-
sor in the Columbia Law
School and a dean (mind
you) of the Union Theologi-
cal Seminary.
This use of professors by
the Liberal Party of New
York has a significance
which reaches far beyond
the State. For the Liberal
Party of New York is an au-
thentic labor party.
It was originally created
as a dissident faction of
what was called the Ameri-
can Labor Party of New
York, an aggregation dom-
inated by the late Vito Mar-
cantonio, who served in the
00
br
recting intelligence in the
Liberal Party is David Du-
hinsky, head of the Ladies
Garment Workers. And the
money and organization
that keep the Liberal Party
together are the Dubinsky
union.
The professors and the
dean would probably resent
the suggestion, but they
really serve the party only as
the wooden Indians of an-
other generation served ci-
gar stores, or as the red,
white and blue poles out-
side the shops serve the
barbers inside.
But this combination of
professorial titles and the
gift of speaking and writ-
ing in broad flowing terms
about human rights, etc.,
with the house-to-house or-
ganization and opulent
treasury of a labor union
produces results.
This has been well il-
lustrated in the history of
the British Labor Party,
which is supported by mon-
ey exacted from members
of the trade unions and
which has a large represen-
tation of professors, jour-
nalists, and various kinds of
welfare workers in its par-
liamentary representation.
â˜…
The lesson we should
draw from this reference to
the Liberal Party of New
York is that, as the Demo-
cratic Party becomes to a
greater and greater degree
dominated, financed, and
organized by Walter Reuth-
er's political action com-
mittee and the allied group
in the AFL, this mobiliza-
tion of "intellectuals" will
be more and more zealous-
ly pursued.
Perhaps Chairman Hall
appreciates this and is anx-
ious to show that the Re-
publicans can also have
professors working for
them.
