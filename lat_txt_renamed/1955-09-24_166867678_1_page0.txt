RAYMOND MOLEY:
Stevenson's Political
Star Is Fading Rapidly
I have held the opinion
since the election of 1952
that, whatever may hap-
pen on the Republican side,
Adlai Stevenson is all
through as a candidate for
the Presidency.
I may add that from the
moment when he was first
mentioned as a possible
nominee well before 1952, I
held a very limited opinion
of him as candidate mate-
rial. For while he is a gra-
cious and no doubt a gener-
ous politician with a happy
gift of language, there is
lacking the stern stuff so
necessary to capture the
support of people in the
mass.
★
The evidence in support
of my opinion is accumu-
lating these days when all
political eyes are fixed on
1956.
A recent release of Joe
Belden's highly respected
Texas poll points out that if
Stevenson and Eisenhower
should be candidates again
in 1956, the latter would
win decisively in Texas. The
Belden figures show a
steady loss for Stevenson
over the past two years.
In August, 1953, Steven-
son polled 48% of the decid-
ed voters, but in three polls
since he has dropped to 36%.
Meanwhile, Eisenhower
has gone up from 41% in
1953 to 51% in August of
this year.
The popularity of the
President, according to this
poll, jumped from 43% in
May of this year to 51% in
August. This was in line
with the rising expectation
of those polled that the
chances for peace were
greatly improved by Eisen-
hower's efforts in Geneva.
★
Eisenhower's appeal is
much greater in the cities
of Texas than in the rural
districts. The great increase
in the industrial life of
Texas cities with many new
residents from northern
cities as well as the pre-
vailing conservatism of
Texas businessmen have
shifted the traditional bal-
ance in urban districts,
while in rural areas the
Democratic Party with its
entrenched officeholders is
supreme.
There are other bits of
evidence showing the grow-
ing weakness of Stevenson
as a possible candidate. In
New York State Gov. Harri-
man's answer to all sugges-
tions that he run is the laco-
nic "I'm for Stevenson."
The sincerity of that ex-
pression of allegiance is
thrown into doubt by the
open talk among New York
Democratic leaders that
Harriman is going to be the
candidate.
Moreover, it must be
borne in mind in all specu-
lation that if Stevenson is
to be a candidate, he must
this time pass the arduous
test of several Presidential
primaries.
Those primaries begin in
March. In 1952 Stevenson
could afford to play coy un-
til the convention, while Ke-
fauver won his votes the
hard way. Suppose that Ke-
fauver should confront Ste-
venson in a few States and
win. That might not nomi-
nate the Tennessee Senator,
but it would certainly ex-
tinguish Stevenson.
★
I cannot see the logic in
the talk that Democratic
bosses anticipating a defeat
at the polls would be in fa-
vor of Stevenson because
another defeat would finish
him forever. That reasoning
assumes that the bosses are
afraid of the independence
of Stevenson.
But there is nothing in
the record to show that Ste-
venson would be a menace
to the bosses who would
help to elect him. In fact, in
1952 he showed every con-
sideration for bosses both of
city political machines and
of labor.
Contrary to this specula-
tion that bosses nominate
people in order to bring
about their defeat is the fact
that smart bosses never as-
sume that they are going to
lose.
With so many uncertain-
ties as may confront the Re-
publican ticket in 1956,
Democratic bosses have a
right to believe that they
have a very good chance to
win. Therefore, smart bosses
are going to favor the
strongest possible condidate.
That strongest possible
candidate is clearly not Ste-
venson, and for that reason
the bosses may oppose rath-
er than favor him for the
nomination.
