FUTURE LIFE OF EASE MAY TURN OUT DULL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
George Soule, in the
latest of his innumerable
books on economic and po-
litical affairs, tells us that
the head of the average
American family will have
an income of $25,000 and
will work only 24 hours a
week in 2035.
But if I am to be permit-
ted to have a ghostly glance
at the world in that year I
shall, if things are as Soule
says they will be, offer up a
prayer of thanksgiving that
I lived in a hardier and
more interesting age.
★
This paradise on earth,
Soule says, will come if
technology follows the same
course that we have wit-
nessed in the last two dec-
ades.
However, as a fairly close
reader of some of Soule's
earlier books on social
planning, I am pretty sure
that things to come may not
be in the image of his proph-
ecies.
In 1932 there was pub-
lished a book by Soule en-
titled "A Planned Society,"
which declared that the
way to happiness was away
from capitalism with its
"unmanaged civilization."
The true model of plan-
ning he found in Soviet
Russia. Some of the flavor
of his chapter on Russia
can be found in the follow-
ing statement:
"But Russia has not
abolished capital - the dif-
ference is that her saving
and her capital are social
instead of individual."
That was written in 1932.
In 1955 Soule envisions
something of the same ob-
jective for the United
States. He says in the new
book, "Time for Living":
"Even if people had all
they wanted of things they
buy as individuals, there
are large unsatisfied needs
for things and services that
they buy as taxpayers."
Thus, under the planned
economy we are to get
things from the govern-
ment which we cannot af-
ford as individuals. These
will come from the taxes
that the government takes
from us (calling it "buying"
with taxes). Presumably
the reason we will not have
all the money we need for
the things we want is that
the government will be buy-
ing so much for us out of
our own taxes.
In 1932 the wonderful
things we were to have
would come merely from
planning. In 1955 they will
come from technology. But
the life that he envisioned
for us in the happy future
would be the same in both
cases.
In both books we are
promised beautiful com-
munities. In both we shall
spend much of our vast sup-
ply of leisure in sports. In
1932 he said that we would
"get back to the woods, to
have camp fires, to swim, to
fish, to hunt." In 1955 he
adds to hunting and fishing,
"golf and sailing and motor
boats and winter sports."
In 1932 we were prom-
ised the chance "to paint
pictures, to act in plays, to
grow gardens, to read, to
make our own furniture."
In 1955 we will have lots
of new books for reading,
new phonograph records,
movies, and amateur drama
and music.
There seems to have been
a loss of Soule's interest in
methods of self-amusement
and self-improvement since
1932. Perhaps that is be-
cause there now promises
to be more technology than
was envisioned in 1932. But
we shall still make furni-
ture and boats with our own
hands. And there will be
gardening without limit.
★
Now it happens that some
of us loathe and detest most
of these activities. I cannot
imagine a more boring ex-
istence than a life with
Soule in 2035.
Four important points are
strangely missing from both
books.
The first is the innate de-
sire of some of us to work at
something vastly more ex-
citing and profitable than
making furniture or hoeing
a garden.
Another is the complete
neglect of Soule to point out
that the technology which
is to make us so happy has
up to now been the product
of the much-despised sys-
tem of free enterprise.
Another omission is any
suggestion of what people
are going to have left of the
$25,000 after the planned
society has bought us so
many things with our own
money in taxes.
Finally, there is no word
about savings. Probably that
antisocial custom will be
obsolete.
