ALTITUDE
PERIL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is a significant item
concerning the President's
illness which I have not up
to this time seen in any of
the dispatches from Denver.
That is the fact that the at-
tack came not only after a
digestive disturbance and
somewhat unusual exercise
but in a high altitude.
As a layman I should re-
frain from discussing the
physiological aspects of the
case. But since as a young
man my failure to respect
the effect of the high alti-
tude of Denver cost me ex-
actly a year of illness and
partial incapacitation for an-
other year, I enjoy the au-
thority conferred by bitter
experience and long study
of the subject.
I learned in the pursuit
of my own health that my
blood pressure rose, at an
altitude of around a mile,
to 180. Not a good many
years later it is 40 points
below that. But my experi-
ence in neglecting that
warning has given me a
sharp consciousness of al-
titude since.

It was my experience in
that earlier year that caused
me to entertain grave mis-
givings in 1919, when
Woodrow Wilson, toward
the end of his great Septem-
ber swing around the circuit-
turned toward the higher
altitudes. This, I believed,
was asking for trouble.
After he had been on the
road crossing the continent
and down the Pacific Coast,
he turned east and spoke
in Reno, then Ogden, Salt
Lake City, Cheyenne and
Denver,
All these were in alti-
tudes ranging from 4370 to
6097 feet. Then, finally, at
Pueblo, the overstrained ar-
teries gave way and ended
a great career. All the
speeches he had delivered
were impassioned appeals.
The final ones in Denver
and Pueblo fill 13 and 16
closely printed pages, re-
spectively.
While there was appar-
ently no paralysis in the
case of President Eisen-
hower, the heart condition
described by the attending
physicians was unquestion-
ably partially caused by the
altitudes in which he had
been living for some days.
★
Fraser, where he spent
the days before his illness,
has an altitude of 8568 feet.
There, on Friday morning,
he had what was described
in the press as a tremen-
dous breakfast. Then he re-
turned to the vicinity of
Denver, where he began his
27-hole golf game. In the
course of the game he had
the hamburger and onions
which have been mentioned
in the press. Then the di-
gestive disturbance, and
finally the heart attack.
In short, he had asked
the machinery of his body
to take three shocks at an
age when, as Emerson sug-
gested, we should "take in
sail." First, digestive, then
physical exercise (it is true
that he had the advantage
of an electric cart in his
golf game), and an altitude
in which every non-native
must exercise restraint.
★
The question must arise
in the case of Eisenhower,
as in that of Wilson, as to
whether the White House
physicians in charge took
the dangers of altitude into
consideration or whether
they had patients difficult
to manage. There should al-
ways be not only a wise
doctor but an obedient pa-
tient.
In any event, we now
have two cases in which
disregard of altitude has
caused national tragedy. It
behooves us all to keep this
in mind. The air is fine out
there in the Mountain Time
zone, but acclimatization is
not attained in a day or
two.
