WE STILL NEED DIGGERS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At a meeting signaling
the opening of the 16th Na-
tional Newspaper Week,
Richard W. Slocum, presi-
dent of the American News-
paper Publishers Associa-
tion, offered a comment that
might well be heeded by all
those who are responsible
for the dissemination of
news in these eventful
years. He said:
"The purpose of National
Newspaper Week is not for
the exultation and promo-
tion of newspapers."
*
The implication of his re-
mark, is, I assume, that
there should be fewer of the
familiar speeches paying
tribute to freedom of the
press, and more serious
stock-taking by both press
and government as to their
own service to the public.
For while we may well
rejoice, after considering
what happened to La Pren-
sa under Peron, in the ex-
tent to which freedom of the
press is enjoyed in this
country, there is plenty of
room for improvement both
among the makers and the
writers of news.
In preparing some re-
marks for a meeting cele-
brating National Newspa-
per Week, I addressed an
inquiry to a number of my
friends who, as representa-
tives of the press have en-
joyed long experience in
dealing with government
agencies.
My specific question was
whether there was a real
problem in getting informa-
tion on public business in
Washington and, if so, what
the nature of that difficulty
is and what might be done
to correct it.
*
The replies brought out a
number of criticisms not
only of government agen-
cies, but of the press repre-
sentatives charged with the
job of news-gathering.
After reading the very
helpful replies to my ques-
tion, and on the basis of my
own observations, it seems
to me that there are a num-
ber of criticisms that might
be leveled at both the mak-
ers and the writers of news.
One is the fact that the
government in Washington
is literally swarming with
press officers whose job it is
to inform the public, largely
through contacts with
the press. According to most
newspapermen, there are
altogether too many. But it
is not quantity but quality
that is the most serious
charge.
In recent years govern-
ment press officers have
taken to calling themselves
public relations people. The
significance of this change
is that too often they con-
ceive of their duty as
molding public opinion fa-
vorable to their respective
agencies, rather than per-
forming the straight task of
helping newspapermen get
facts on the basis of which
the public can form its own
opinion.
*
There is among most
newspapermen high praise
for the late Stephen Early,
who served President Roo-
sevelt for many years, and
also for President Eisen-
hower's James C. Hagerty.
Both of these men fought
hard to get all the news
possible for the press rep-
resentatives.
On the other hand, there
is plenty of room for im-
provement on the side of
the press. As modern gov-
ernment has grown more
and more complex, there
has not been enough prep-
aration and training for re-
porters who are expected to
cover it and interpret it to
the public.
â˜…
There is room for more
educational effort, not
merely the school of jour-
nalism sort but training on
the job.
Two of my friends who
replied to my question said
flatly that in this age of
handouts the old kind of re-
porter who was in the habit
of digging for his own infor-
mation has practically be-
come extinct. This is a very
serious matter which the
responsible leaders of the
press might consider and
take steps to remedy.
There must be something
more than mere freedom in
the flow of information.
There must be more of an
effort to put on the bare
bones of the news interpre-
tative but unslanted mate-
rial written by informed
and trained reporters.
