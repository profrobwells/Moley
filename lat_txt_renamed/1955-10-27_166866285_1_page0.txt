HOW THE LABOR BOSSES
CHOSE TRUMAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Truman memoirs
have added another ver-
sion of the incredible story
of double-dealing, confusion
and selfishness that char-
acterized his nomination for
Vice-President in 1944 and
that paved the way to the
Presidency for him. The late
Edward J. Flynn told the
story his way in his auto-
biography, and Grace Tulley
added a few touches.
Much more clarification
will come when James F.
Byrnes, who lost the nomi-
nation at the behest of labor
bosses and Flynn, tells his
story.
My space here limits me
to only one phase of the
story, which indicates the
courting of the labor lead-
ers by the man who became
President. This clearly
shows that as long ago as
1944 labor leaders were
firmly established in a po-
sition to dictate the nomi-
nations in the Democratic
convention.
We all recall that Alben
Barkley in 1952 said in an
impassioned statement that
his way was barred by the
labor bosses.
Truman says that just be-
fore he left home to attend
the Democratic convention
in July, 1944, Byrnes called
him from Washington and
said that President Roose-
velt had indicated that he
(Byrnes) was the Presiden-
tial choice for Vice-Presi-
dent. Truman then agreed
to place the name of Byrnes
before the convention.
The Truman story then
says that the Missouri Sena-
tor, when he reached Chi-
cago ostensibly pledged to
the candidacy of Byrnes,
immediately made the
round of the labor bosses.
The first one he met was
Sidney Hillman, who said
he was not for Byrnes but
for Truman or William O.
Douglas, a justice of the
Supreme Court.
If Truman were not a
candidate in his own mind
up to that moment, his sub-
sequent actions certainly
indicated that he became
one very soon. And also
that he realized the way to
the nomination was through
the labor bosses rather than
through the responsible of-
ficers of the party and the
administration.
For he then went to
Philip Murray of the CIO,
and then to A. F. Whitney
of the Railway Trainmen.
Both of these were for the
two people named by Hill-
man, an interesting coinci-
dence. Finally, Truman
hunted up William Green
of the AFL, who also fa-
vored the man from Mis-
souri.
Later, it appeared that
Roosevelt himself, after giv-
ing Byrnes the impression
that he was for him, had
written a letter to Robert
Hannegan with the same
two names as the labor
bosses had suggested.
What Truman does not
say is that, according to
Flynn's story, Hannegan
and Boss Kelly of Chicago
were for Byrnes, and that
Flynn thereupon threatened
Roosevelt with the loss of
New York if Byrnes were
nominated. He exacted from
the sick President a promise
to drop Byrnes and take
Truman.
Even then, Flynn had a
hard time bringing Hanne-
gan and Kelly over to Tru-
man.
In his book, "You're The
Boss," Flynn says: "I brow-
beat . . . I talked, I argued,
I swore and finally they said
if the President would tell
them again he was for Tru-
man they would agree."
And so Flynn got the Presi-
dent on the telephone and
had him tell the wavering
politicians that they must
be for Truman.
Prior to this conversation,
when the Presidential train
stopped in Chicago on its
way west, Roosevelt had
given explicit orders to
Kelly and Hannegan that
they must "clear it with
Sidney." This meant that
no one should be nominated
whom the labor bosses had
not passed upon.
It will be interesting and
important to see whom the
heirs and assigns of Hill-
man, Murray and Green will
choose in 1956.
