CITY FILE
FUROR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The heavens have been
rent these past few years by
the screams of so-called lib-
erals defending "the right
of privacy" against the ac-
tivities of Congressional
committees. Much of this
protest was bogus because
in most of the cases in-
volved no really innocent
person was injured. The
"liberals" simply found the
issue a convenient way of
discrediting Congress and
exalting executive power.
Now there came two in-
stances in which avowedly
liberal people have attempt-
ed an invasion of privacy
more serious than any Con-
gressional committee has
perpetrated in recent years.
The first has happily re-
ceived national attention
since its denunciation by
Atty. Gen. Brownell. It was
the "bugging," or spying,
on the deliberation of ju-
ries in the Federal District
Court in Wichita, Kan., by
members of the faculty of
the Chicago University
School of Law in the in-
terest of what they called
"research."

The other more recent
example concerns the New
York City government. It
seems that Mayor Robert
Wagner, son of the re-
nowned New Deal Sen.
Wagner, agreed to a plan to
open the files of city de-
partments to a close friend
and TV producer, Theodore
Granik. The idea was to get
rich human interest materi-
al for what would in essence
be a sort of serialized soap
opera.
The Mayor, bubbling with
enthusiasm about a new
way of getting publicity for
his administration for free,
issued an executive order
to all departments to open
the files to the TV drama-
tists. It is only incidental
that no arrangement was
made to give the hard-
pressed city treasury any
of the profits.
Commissioner Stephen P.
Kennedy, an able and out-
spoken veteran of the Po-
lice Department, flatly re-
fused to open police files to
anyone including the Gran-
ik people.

Members of the New
York Police Department
have committed sins in the
past but the organization
itself has fine and cher-
ished traditions, and one of
them is the duty to protect
not only shopkeepers' prop-
erty and pedestrians cross-
ing the streets but the pri-
vate affairs of innocent peo-
ple who are mentioned in
police records.
The Mayor, politician
enough to realize that in
his hasty act he had certain-
ly "plowed up a snake,"
postponed the project pend-
ing a study to be conducted
under the general auspices
of Dr. Luther Gulick, a lib-
eral municipal reformer.
who holds a job under Wag-
ner called City Administra-
tor.

*

Gulick, not so sophisticat-
ed politically as his boss,
and possessed of that arbi-
trary temperament so com-
mon among uplifters, com-
pounded the blunder by
saying that the Police Com-
missioner would surely go
along with the project be-
cause he was, after all, "just
another commissioner," and
could "be removed "over-
night."
This brought a round
drubbing for the doctor
from the press. He then
hastened further to com-
pound his mistake by blam-
ing the papers for miscon-
struing his remarks. This
certainly failed to sooth the
indignation of the Commis-
sioner who knew perfectly
well the threat in the origi-
nal Gulick statement.

*

Such a plan, moreover,
not only affects the Police
Department. The License
Commissioner, the Hospital
Commissioner and the Wel-
fare Commissioner all made
it clear that their confiden-
tial files should never be
made the material for soap
operas.
That is where the matter
now stands. The Mayor's
hasty act has been thwart-
ed by a courageous Police
Commissioner and an alert
press. It is likely that Gran-
ik will have to create his
plots out of the imagina-
tion of script writers.

TODAY IN HISTORY
BY BRAINERD DYER

A momentous and heated
six-week debate in Con-
gress and in the country at
large ended Nov. 4, 1939,
as Congress amended the
nation's neutrality legisla-
tion to permit the belliger-
ent European powers to
purchase munitions and
war equipment in the
United States provided
they paid cash on the bar-
relhead and carried the
goods away in their own
ships.
Earlier in the decade, in
the light of what it re-
garded as the lessons of
World War I, Congress had
adopted strict neutrality
laws hoping that by keep-
ing American ships and
citizens out of war zones
and American money and
war supplies at home the
nation could be insulated
from future European con-
flicts.
Now with war at hand
and 84%, of the American
people anxious for an Al-
lied victory, Congress re-
sponded to President Roose-
velt's plea that the arms
embargo was in fact "dan-
gerous to American neu-
trality, American security
and American peace" and
that the best way to keep
America out of war was to
aid the Allies to victory.
The self-imposed restric-
tions were relaxed and
American factories were
free to furnish war supplies
on the cash-and-carry ba-
sis.

FAMOUS FABLES
BY E. E, EDGAR

Alexander Stephens,
Vice-President of the Con-
federacy, was small in sta-
ture but long on wit. At one
time, he was to fight a duel
with a giant of a man who
was twice his size.
When the two appeared
on the field of honor, the op-
ponent took one look at Ste-
phens and snorted.
"This is unfair. He has a
much bigger target to shoot
at."
"We can readily fix that,"
said Stephens. "We'll have
the seconds chalk out my
size on your body. If I hit
anything outside that, it
won't count. Agreed?"
The other decided it
would be more prudent to
apologize, and the duel was
called off.
