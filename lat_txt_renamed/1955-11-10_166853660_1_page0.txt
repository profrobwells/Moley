NEITHER BRUTUS NOR CAESAR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a burning and, it seems
to me, a wholly effective re-
ply to some of the animad-
versions in the Truman
memoirs which were direct-
ed at James F. Byrnes, the
former Secretary of State
tells of his first intimation
that he had mortally offend-
ed the President.
In 1949, Byrnes made a
speech in which he was crit-
ical of government spend-
ing. Truman, who apparent-
ly felt that any suggestion
of economy was a devilish
blow at his honor and good
name, scribbled a note to
Byrnes saying "Et tu,
Brute."

Byrnes replied, saying:
"I hope that you are not
going to think of me as a
Brutus, because I am no
Brutus. I hope that you are
not going to think of your-
self as a Caesar, because
you are no Caesar."
Most people will agree
that Truman was no Ceasar,
but in one respect Truman
is continuing a tradition as
old as Caesar. He is writing
his own account of his ex-
ploits in the public service.
That this account of Tru-
man of his administration
will not prove to be the last
word is obvious. The replies
and denials are already
coming in. And that which
has been made by Byrnes
raises some very interesting
questions.
In the first place, Byrnes
flatly denies the truth of
some of Truman's recitals of
events. Notably, he denies
Truman's account of certain
events which led to Tru-
man's nomination for Vice-
President in 1944. On the
basis of certain collateral
evidence presented by Ed-
ward J. Flynn, who seems
to have had much to do in
getting the nomination for
Truman, Byrnes is justified
in his denial.
Harry S. Truman
The twisting of the facts
to fit a self-created pattern
is common in the memoirs
of politicians. We can trust
future historians to evalu-
ate the evidence and elicit
a measure of truth.
But Byrnes reveals a sit-
uation which will puzzle
and confuse historians of
this period for all time to
come. It was a little trick
of Truman to write letters
to people and then refrain
from sending them. They
would then go into the files
apparently with no warn-
ing information that they
James Byrnes
were not communicated to
the person addressed.
In the Byrnes instance
Truman says that he
"wrote out in longhand"
a letter to Byrnes which he
read to the Secretary of
State on Jan. 5, 1946.
This letter is a long com-
plaint in which he charges
the Secretary with what
would really have to be
characterized as insubordi-
nation. Such a letter re-
ceived by a public official
as sensitive as Byrnes has
always proved himself to be
would provoke a resigna-
tion.
This letter with the im-
plied charge of insubordi-
nation has appeared before.
It was in the book entitled
"Mr. President," by Wil-
liam Hillman which was
published in 1950.

Byrnes replied to this
charge in an article in Col-
liers in 1952. In that reply
he flatly says that Truman
neither sent the letter to
him nor, as Truman claims,
read it to him. Byrnes
notes also that accompany-
ing the letter in the Tru-
man files there is a note in
which Truman says that he
read it to Byrnes in order
to get its contents to him
urgently and with empha-
sis.
The alleged letter is
lengthy and contains many
points of important for-
eign policy that Truman
as President wanted to
have carried out. It would
seem that he would have
given it to Byrnes rather
than to expect Byrnes to
remember all of its con-
tents.
This indeed is "making"
history. Caesar in all of his
claims of infallibility in his
writings never hit on this
cute trick.
