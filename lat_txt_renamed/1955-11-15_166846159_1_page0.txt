Two developments dur-
ing the past two weeks
should give great cheer to
advocates of economy and
of the conservation of na-
tional and State parks and
forest preserves.
Senators, Congressmen
and others from Colorado,
Utah, Wyoming and New
Mexico met in a closed ses-
sion in Denver and, after
looking the realities square-
ly in the face, decided to
drop their two-year-old
fight to build a dam in Din-
osaur National Monument
at Echo Park.
★
In a letter to conserva-
tionists Sen. Clinton An-
derson stated flatly that the
group agreed "not to try to
reinsert Echo Park Dam in
any form" in future bills
for the development of the
Upper Colorado.
This apparently ends a
two-year fight between
these Senators and Con-
gressmen and national so-
cieties dedicated to the con-
servation of national parks
and monuments. Whether
this means the death or the
drastic revision of the en-
tire Upper Colorado Project
will not be known until
Secretary McKay announc-
es the plans of the adminis-
tration concerning this
highly controversial sub-
ject.
Opponents who were
concerned not only with
the conservation aspects of
the plan but its immense
cost will keep their fingers
crossed for a while.

In New York voters re-
jected by a vote of almost
3 to 1 a proposal to build
Panther Dam in the Adiron-
dack Forest Preserve. This
comes after 10 years of con-
troversy in the courts and
in the Legislature.
The New York voters also
indicated a strong tendency
toward economy by reject-
ing several other spending
projects.
The byplay on this New
York issue and the result
thereof lends no luster to
New York's favorite son in
Gov. Ed Johnson
the Democratic Presidential
race. For Gov. Harriman
succeeded in taking posi-
tions on three sides of a sin-
gle issue.
Harriman and Sen. Leh-
man both violently opposed
the Panther Dam when run-
ning for election. Both
shifted their position since
and supported the building
of the dam. Finally Harri-
man desperately sought to
spread the word after it be-
came clear that the dam
would be defeated that he
had taken no position on
either side at any time.

In the Denver meeting of
the Upper Colorado people
Gov. Ed Johnson attempted
to convince his western col-
leagues that they ought to
drop the whole Colorado
storage project for this ses-
sion except the Glen Can-
yon Dam which even the
bitter opponents of the proj-
ect freely admit to be a feas-
ible power enterprise. He
found no support for this
policy of real moderation.
With or without the Echo
Park Dam the Upper Colo-
rado Project will meet de-
termined opposition in the
new session of Congress. For
despite the atmosphere of
an election year members of
the House of Representa-
tives are, as they were last
summer, not inclined to tax
all the States for benefit of
a favored four.
