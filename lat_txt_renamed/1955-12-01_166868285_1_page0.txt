Gov. Harriman's election-
eering visit to the North-
west ended on a dismal note.
For on Nov. 22, while he
was making a regular
Trumanesque tirade on
"giveaway" electric power
in Milwaukie, Or., the voters
in Stevens County in the
adjoining State of Washing-
ton voted by a majority of
more than two to one to sell
their publicly owned electric
power properties to the
privately owned Washing-
ton Water Power Co.
The next day Harriman
tried to cover his embarrass-
ment with further state-
ments in Lewiston, Ida. In
Milwaukie he was guilty of
economic misstatements; in
Lewiston of fantastically
wrong political facts.
It seems that Harriman's
preoccupation with affairs
in New York and in give-
away activities in many
foreign nations has prevent-
ed him from learning the
facts concerning certain
States in which he is fran-
tically scrounging around
for convention delegates.
He should have been told
before visiting the three
most northwestern States
that only one, Washington,
has shown a predilection for
public ownership of electric
power. Oregon and Idaho
have, over and over, shown
their preference for the
service of private com-
panies.
The latest news from
Washington, however, is
that public power is losing
the attractiveness which
was present in 1930 when
the State adopted legisla-
tion which permitted voters
to create public utility dis-
tricts (known commonly as
PUDs).
Since the enactment of
that legislation, 23 of the
State's 39 counties have
created public utility dis-
tricts.
The State of Oregon also
has a law permitting the
creation of PUDs, but since
1940 no election for the
creation of a PUD has been
won by the public power
people. The State, except
for a few politicians, seems
completely satisfied with the
service given them by pri-
vate companies.
Stevens County, Wash-
ington, was served by a
PUD and also by the Wash-
ington Water Power Co.
Something more than half
of the customers of the
county were served by the
private company and some-
thing less than that number
by the PUD.
Recently it became evi-
dent that it was uneconomi-
cal to have two competing
services. The PUD there-
fore filed condemnation pro-
ceedings against the private
company's properties in the
county. Thereupon a big
delegation of citizens vis-
ited the PUD commission-
ers and demanded a public
referendum.
The Washington Water
Power Co. agreed to accept
a handicap in the election
to the effect that if the PUD
got more than 40% of the
votes, it would sell to the
public power agency.
Thus a representative
group of citizens, those
"common people" for whom
the cold blue blood of Har-
riman flows so freely, after
a thorough trial of both
public and private power
service were allowed to ex-
press a preference. The re-
sult was a vote of more
than 70% selling out the
PUD properties.
This was very embarras-
sing to Harriman, who had
selected the day of the elec-
tion to make his public
speech. At Lewiston he was
ready with alibis. He said
that the Stevens vote was
no test.
The real test, he said, was
in 1954 when Richard Neu-
berger was running for the
Senate in Oregon and Gra-
cie Pfost was running in
Idaho for the House. Both,
according to Harriman,
were running on the same
issue. That is what he said.
What he did not say was
that in the 1954 election in
Oregon there were elections
in three counties in that
State on whether a PUD
should be established. Two
of those counties were on
the Pacific Coast; the other,
in the vicinity of Hell's Can-
yon.
All three went against
creating PUDs. Harriman
did not say that in Idaho in
the same election Glenn
Taylor, after campaigning
for a year on the public
power issue, was buried un-
der an avalanche of votes.
Also, that over and over
Governors, Senators, and
Congressmen from the
southern district in Idaho
have been elected after
being pledged to the Idaho
Power Company's plan for
building power installations
in Hell's Canyon.
The plain, simple fact is
that the people of the
Northwest are interested in
buying electric power from
agencies that give efficient
service at a fair price. This,
they regard as a practical
problem.
The people of Oregon and
Idaho have been supplied
by private companies which
under State regulation have
been giving such service at
such prices. Apparently the
people of Washington, who
are the same sort of people,
are of the same opinion as
their neighbors in the two
adjoining States.
Only politicians hungry
for votes can find any dis-
tinction between efficient
service at a fair price from
a public or from a private
agency.
