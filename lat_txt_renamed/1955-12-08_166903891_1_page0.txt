WELL-HIDDEN MEANING, IF ANY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those many millions who
must have seen the uncom-
fortable 30 minutes of Dr.
Robert Hutchins, president
of the Ford Foundation's
Fund for the Republic, on
the "Meet the Press" tele-
vision program no doubt
realized that the inquisitors
were not friendly. That lack
of sympathy might partial-
ly be explained by the fact
that Hutchins obviously
was evading their questions.
But such evasion is so
often met in an experienced
reporter's life that it does
not especially anger him.
It merely sharpens his in-
tention to get answers to
his question.
The reporters indicated
an irritation far beyond a
mere acceleration of their
efforts to pursue a reluc-
tant witness. This was due
to the fact that the report-
ers and Hutchins were es-
sentially speaking different
languages.
â˜…
Reporters are trained to
use words that reveal mean-
ing, so that their readers
will come away enlightened
and informed. Hutchins is
a social scientist of a new
and quite common order,
and his language is encum-
bered by the obscurities of
a new and quite fantastic
jargon.
It was notable to those
who follow "Meet the Press"
that the reporters had
seemed more at home with
the broken English of the
Foreign Ministers of Egypt
and India than they were
with the gobbledygook of
this home-bred product of
Oberlin and Yale.
It was the late President
Lowell of Harvard who said
that political science would
not attain the real status of
a science until it had de-
veloped a vocabulary unin-
telligible to the average
man. He should be living
now!
Sometimes, as in the case
of Paul Hoffman, who is
and has been for some time
Hutchins' boss, the jargon
of social science gets min-
gled with some of the jar-
gon of hucksterism, and the
result is a horrendous mix-
ture.
For example, when Hoff-
man was before the Cox
Committee on Tax-Exempt
Foundations to explain the
Ford Foundation of which
he was then head, he offered
a choice collection of words
and phrases yanked from
their traditional meaning
and tagged onto the opera-
tions of his foundation.
The Ford dough he called
"the venture capital of prog-
ress." The foundation's ac-
tivity in India was "a trig-
ger action." A young per-
son working with Ford
money to prepare himself
for something or other pos-
sessed an "internship."
In two excessively long
and dull articles on the Ford
Foundation in what used to
be the sprightly New York-
er magazine, some choice
examples of the jargon of
people subsidized through
the efforts of Hoffman and
Hutchins are offered. Dr.
Mortimer Adler, who re-
ceived $640,000 to work up
what was called a "Summa
Dialectica" to be finished in
the year 2002, offers this
one:
"We have discovered that
if an author does subscribe
to two nuclear agreements,
he will disagree with an
author who subscribes to
only one of these two, in
a way that is different from
the way in which authors
who subscribe to only one
among themselves."
Alas, this distresses me
no end, for I knew Adler at
Columbia University when
he could talk in very un-
derstandable language. But
he has since developed
what his "researchers" call
a "private language."
His group of "research-
ers" say: "Problems of style
are most vexatious. The
language we have invented
in order to reach a common
understanding of our pri-
mary notions is, unfortu-
nately, a private language,
consisting of the special
words and symbols we had
to employ to facilitate
strictly intramural commu-
nication. (We must) invent
a perspicuous and effective
literary format for the com-
munication of our findings."
It was easy to see how
"effective" the Hutchins jar-
gon was on the "Meet the
Press" reporters.
