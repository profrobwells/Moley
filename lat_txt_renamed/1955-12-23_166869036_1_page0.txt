To most of us, Australia
is the home of some first-
class fighting men in two
world wars, of wonderful
tennis players, and strange
animals and birds. The
child in us all marvels at
the kangaroo, the koala
teddy bear that never takes
a drink, the platypus, the
animal with a bill; the
wombat, the dingo, and the
anteater.
To some of us Australia
has for many years been the
"proof" offered by Socialists
that their schemes really
work-have been working,
in fact, for upward of a
half-century. Even today I
am told by ardent single-
taxers that the ideas of
Henry George are alive and
working in Australia.

Of course, there were
skeptics way back in the
days when Socialism first
gained a foothold in Austra-
lia and New Zealand. George
Chaffee, a pioneer who
taught pioneers in Southern
California how to build a
civilization without govern-
ment handouts, was induced
to try his hand in Australia.
He went there in 1886 and
remained more than a dec-
ade.
Ultimately, his efforts to
establish colonies based up-
on free enterprise were
frustrated by the growing
radical movement, and he
returned to the United
States.
Perhaps Chaffee's opinion
that Socialism is a blight in
any country explains the
fact that the full potential of
Australia has never been
developed as it might have
been. Perhaps the recent
smashing victory of the
Liberal Country coalition
indicates that the Australian
electorate is beginning to
realize that fact.
The conservative turn in
Australia, like that in Brit-
ain and indeed in some Fair
Deal circles here, is shown
by the modification of the
demands of the left wing.
The Australian Labor
Party's manifesto was
vastly more restrained
than its past declarations
of policy. Perhaps, as in
Stevenson's use of the
word "moderate," the dif-
ference is only semantic.
But it is a concession to a
shifting public opinion.

It is well for Conserva-
tives to note that not only
in Australia but in Britain
and the United States the
mass of votes favoring
more Socialistic policies is
very large and will for
many years be a serious
threat. Millions in all
English-speaking countries
still distrust free enter-
prise.
In Australia, as in Brit-
ain last May, the rout of
the Labor Party was made
more positive by the disin-
tegration of party organiza-
tion. In short, had there
been a vigorous and effi-
cient machine to get out
the vote, the results would
have been a closer match-
ing of party strength.
In both countries there
are dissident factions. In
Australia the anti-Evatt
Laborites were 5.7% of the
total vote, while in the elec-
tion of Gaitskell the Bevan-
ites' strength was 26% of
the party strength.
Perhaps the decay of
party organizations and
the appearance of sharp
divisions are both due to
the growing conservatism
of the electorates. But the
victorious Conservatives
cannot take any such in-
terpretation for granted.
