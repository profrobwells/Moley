GAITSKELL
TIDIES UP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Even the British work-
ing people, who have been
victims of so many cruel
deceptions without protest,
are awakening to the ironi-
cal implications of the de-
cay of their Labor Party.
The leaders of that party,
most of whom like to call
themselves intellectuals be-
cause they have been to
college, are now admitting
that while they have made
a mess of the relatively
small job of running a
political party, they should
still be permitted to try
their hand at running an
empire. They would, more-
over, not run the nation
and the empire as have
other parties in days gone
by, with a loose sort of con-
trol of the individuals
therein. They would also
tell all individuals where
to work, what to do and
how to order their personal
lives.

This monstrous fraud,
which seemed to be suc-
cessfully imposed in 1945,
has more and more re-
vealed itself for what it is.
And now Hugh Gaitskell
has come to the top, replac-
ing the mild-mannered but
hopelessly impractical Att-
iee.
The word has gone out
over the world that Gait-
skell represents a real con-
servative turn in the Labor
Party. He is conservative
only because he offers a
contrast to the utterly
Marxist Bevan. The old
itch to run everybody's
business, the bureaucratic
urge to meddle and the in-
sufferable pretense that a
university degree is prep-
aration enough for the prac-
tice of statesmanship in a
modern world is all there
in Gaitskell, just as it was
in Attlee and in the late
Harold Laski.
Gaitskeil's differences
with Bevan are largely mat-
ters of language. They fell
out originally when Gait-
skell as Chancellor of the
Exchequer imposed a small
charge in the health serv-
ice for eyeglasses and a
few other items. Bevan,
who was Minister of Health
during the formative years
of the service, screamed
that this was a crushing af-
front to the workers and a
cruel and inhuman impost.
â˜…
Gaitskell is an Oxonian, a
former teacher and civil
servant. His knowledge of
the working class was
gained in the classrooms of
the Workers' Educational
Alliance.
Like some of the boys
who flourished in the Wash-
ington alphabetical agen-
cies in the 1930s, he care-
fully screens his Socialism
under a pretense that since
capitalism is wasteful, in-
efficient and badly out of
control. it must be "sub-
sumed" in orderly planning
by an authoritarian govern-
ment. He rejects with
horror any suggestion of
revolution. That would only
be another and bloodier
form of disorder. All can be
made smooth by what is
called "administrative ac-
tion."
Gaitskell is a perfect illus-
tration of the fact that there
is nothing really democrat-
ic about Socialism. These
Labor Party "intellectuals"
share none of the tastes or
habits of the workers whom
they profess to serve. They
are ministers to rather than
ministers of the workers.
They are patrons, not pals.
