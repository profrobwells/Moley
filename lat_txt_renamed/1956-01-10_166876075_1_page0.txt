CAUTIOUS ACCENT ON CAR CREDIT
The automobile industry
is very wise in putting its
prediction of sales in 1956
at a figure substantially be-
low that of last year. It is,
in fact, strange that there
have not been more positive
signs of a hesitation in that
market before this. At the
moment there is little ques-
tion about a hardening of
sales resistance.
There is also a growing
realization on the part of
the public, which is only
partially shared by the econ-
omists, that the rise in in-
stallment credit during the
year 1955 was at a rate that
can hardly be expected to
continue without danger.
The Federal Reserve
Board reports that of the
$5,233,000,000 increase in in-
stallment credit in the year,
ending last November, $3,-
786,000,000 was for automo-
biles. Moreover, last Novem-
ber was the 10th straight
month in which installment
credit reached a new record
level, and the 11th straight
month in which automobile
credit hit a new high.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The increase of $5,233,-
000,000 in installment credit
represented a sizable 19% of
the total outstanding. In
short, a great deal of 1955
prosperity was în credit ex-
pansion.
It is this rate of rise that
should put some accent on
caution. For with all of us,
as with each of us, the dan-
ger is not in debt as such,
but the extent to which our
debt increases faster than
our income.
There are other factors in
the automobile industry
which may explain a tem-
porary slowing up-factors
which have to do with al-
terations in the so-called
automobile year, or model
year.
One fact, however, has
not been stressed which
above all is important with
regard not only to the auto-
mobile industry but all busi-
ness. It is the fact that we
are running into a Presi-
dential year.
Some of us are old enough
to remember that it was
axiomatic in the long years
of Republican ascendancy
that a Presidential year was
a time when business looked
and listened more than
usual. It was a waiting
period. Everybody expected
it and everybody prepared
for it.
But since 1925 we have
not had one of those "nor-
mal" years. There was the
depression; then the war;
and then 1948 and 1952.
This begins to look like
1904 or 1924. It is accentuat-
ed at the moment by two
factors—the uncertainty
concerning the identity of
the Republican candidate,
and the depressed condition
of some farmers.
There are features, to be
sure, which distinguish the
present economic situation
from the past, especially the
years which I mentioned
above. But the underlying
situation is the same. It is
confidence that makes for
good times, and we may
have to accept some hesi-
tancy in order that we may
assure ourselves of stability.
THE BOOK
REPORT
BY ROBERT R. KIRSCH
More than any other an-
cient people, the Hittites
owe their place in history
to the comparatively new
science of archaeology. As
recently as 1880, based on
their mention in the Bible,
the Hittites were consid-
ered a minor Canaanite
tribe.
Recent scholarship and
archeological finds have
combined to elevate the Hit-
tites as an important histori-
cal people, with a high de-
gree of civilization.
Between 2000 and 1200
BC the Hittite kings ruled
a great part of Asia Minor,
their conquests achieved by
superior strategy and wea-
pons (including the effec-
tive light chariot) and main-
tained by skillful diplomacy
and an advanced govern-
mental organization.
The exciting acheologi-
cal record is told in THE
SECRETS OF THE HIT-
TITES (Knopf: $5) by C. W.
Ceram whose excellent
"Gods, Graves and Schol-
ars" won acclaim some years
ago.
*
Egyptologists had found
evidence that Pharaoh
Thotmes III had been
forced to pay tribute to the
Hittites. And one Biblical
reference in II Kings vii, 6
seemed to hint that the Hit-
tites were more than a mi-
nor league power. There
were a few puzzling discov-
eries which appeared to fit
in. A Frenchman named
Texier had found imposing
ruins at Boghazkoy in Tur-
key, ruins which were not
readily identifiable. Tablets
bearing strange hieroglyph-
ics kept turning up in
Syria and Turkey.
Then the Englishmen
Archibald Sayce and Wil-
liam Wright posed the
theory that the Hittites had
controlled an empire. The
result was a controversy
which produced headlines
in English newspapers
about a nation dead and
gone 3000 years.
German archeologists
Puchstein, Humann, Von
Luschan and Winkler began
digging and the extent of
the findings could no longer
be ignored. A linguist
named Hrozny, drafted in
the Austro-Hungarian army
during World War I, de-
ciphered the Hittite lan-
guage and demonstrated its
relationship to the Indo-
European languages which
ultimately produced Ger-
man and English. Hroz-
ny gratefully acknowledged
the tolerance of his supe-
rior, an easy-going lieuten-
ent named Kammergruber,
who gave him all the time
necessary for his studies in-
cluding a trip to Constan-
tinople to examine cunei-
form material.
Discoveries by Bossert at
Karatepe in 1947 provided
a bilingual inscription—the
Rosetta Stone of Hittite
language which bore out
Hrozny’s work.
*
Out of this research we
are given a new picture of
the Hittites, an Indo-Eu-
ropean people who swept
down through Asia Minor,
molded the diverse peoples
they conquered into a prim-
itive federal state “united
by contractual ties and
held in line by the military
and economic dominance of
the Hittites.”
The monarchy was not
absolute, “the King being
largely responsible to a
council of nobles known as
the ‘Pankus.’” The Hittite
code differed from other
known Oriental legal codes
in its humaneness. The com-
ponent states retained their
own languages and their
own religions.
Despite these unusual so-
cial and political achieve-
ments, the Hittites never
developed an art, architec-
ture or literature compara-
ble to other peoples of the
areas.
They knew iron, and ac-
cording to Ceram, “around
1600 BC they appear to
have had a certain monop-
oly in the manufacture of
iron.” But such iron as they
had appeared to be “five
times more expensive than
gold, 40 times dearer than
silver.”
But iron was to prove
their downfall. The “peo-
ples from the sea,” the My-
sians and Phrygians, Indo-
Europeans like the early
Hittites, bearing iron weap-
ons took apart the Hittite
empire city by city, a thou-
sand years before the birth
of Christ.
