The nation on Sunday
had an opportunity to see,
hear and appraise the ex-
traordinary Governor of
Ohio, Frank J. Lausche. In
his interview on the Meet
the Press program he an-
swered a wide range of
searching questions with
what appeared to be a grim
determination to make his
position clear, regardless of
political consequences.
There was none of the
carefree and seemingly art-
less showing of charm so
familiar to Ohioans. This
was a man seeking nothing
but the opportunity to
make his views clear to the
country and, incidentally,
to the political party which
he feels certain will not
choose to nominate him.
The reasons why the
Democratic Party will prob-
ably not nominate him re-
flect no credit upon the
people who have taken pos-
session of that party. The
fact is that while certain
labor bosses cannot name
the candidate, they can ef-
fectively block the nomina-
tion of anyone of whom
they disapprove.
This was shown when
James F. Byrnes was tossed
overboard after President
Roosevelt had given him
the assurance that he would
be an acceptable companion
on the ticket. It was "clear
it with Sidney" then.
In 1952 Alben Barkley
found that it was "clear it
with Walter, et al.," and he
was not cleared. Lausche is
not blind to the fact that
"Walter, et al." are more
powerful now than they
were four years ago.
The Democratic Party in
convention assembled will
have a chance to show its
colors, however. For
Lausche will be presented
by a delegation from his
State, and unless all signs
are deceptive he will be
supported by delegates
from a number of other
States. This showing of
hands will be wholesome.
For it will show conserv-
ative Democrats and former
Democrats how far their
party has drifted since it
nominated Alfred E. Smith
28 years ago. And it should
show the conservative
South that its ultimate sal-
vation lies in some sort of
coalition with like-thinking
people in the North.
Most candidates, when
asked why they seek dele-
gates, give an answer simi-
lar to that offered by Sen.
Kefauver â€” an answer
reeking with hypocrisy.
They are, they say, pos-
sessed with the desire to
clamber onto the sacrificial
altar because of the plight
of their country.
Lausche merely indicated
that he was capturing the
Ohio delegation to keep
those representatives of his
State out of the hands of
politicians who would mar-
ket them, like dumb ani-
mals, to the highest bidders.
(The simile is mine, not
Lausche's.)
When asked whether he
would object if Stevenson
and Kefauver should enter
the Ohio primary against
him, Lausche indicated a
cordial receptiveness to
such an invasion of his
State. They are therefore at
perfect liberty to risk, nay,
to invite, the political oblit-
eration so common to those
who have opposed Lausche
in Ohio.
Confronted with the in-
evitable question whether
he voted for Taft in 1950,
he said that "he would not
be telling the truth if he
said that he did not."
He asserted that he not
only favored nondiscrim-
inatory employment prac-
tices, but by clear inference
that he would interpret
those practices to cover not
only racial but union mem-
bership.
He flatly disagreed with
his party's stand in Con-
gress in favor of rigid sup-
ports for agriculture.
He admires Eisenhower
and hopes that he will run.
This is the sort of plain
talk that is needed in the
murky political atmosphere
of the moment. It remains
to be seen whether
Lausche's party wants that
kind of candidate.
