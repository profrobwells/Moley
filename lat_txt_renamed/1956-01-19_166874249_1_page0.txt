JEALOUSY AS A BRAKE
ON HOOVER REFORM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is a sober but to some
an unpalatable truth that
the efforts of the second
Hoover commission have
had less co-operation from
the Eisenhower adminis-
tration.

In the activities of the
commission the devoted
former President had gen-
erally more active and
helpful support from the
Democrats on his commis-
sion than from the Repub-
licans. Sen. McClellan and
Joseph P. Kennedy, veter-
ans from the first comnis-
sion, were towers of
strength for the chairman.
And in general, James A.
Farley lent a willing hand
on most difficult votes.

And now Sen. John F.
Kennedy, as chairman of a
subcommittee, is taking up
the subject of an adminis-
trative Vice-President with
oral testimony by former
President Hoover, a letter
from former President Tru-
man, and a long letter from
Presidential Assistant Sher-
man Adams.

The Truman letter is
rather surprising in that it
repudiates what he had
made clear in some of his
own writings. He has said
in the past that the burdens
of the President are very
great, and judging from
his description of those
burdens, a great deal of the
load might be taken over
by a statutory officer cre-
ated by Congress for the
purpose.

*

The Truman letter seems
to miss the point entirely.
It says that "it is not pos-
sible for him (the Presi-
dent) to delegate any of the
functions of the office as
they are set out in the Con-
stitution."

No one is suggesting the
delegation of any functions
"set out in the Constitu-
tion." The duties which
constitute the crushing load
of a President are the ac-
cumulation of hundreds of
chores created by acts of
Congress. And what the
Congress can give it can
take away without a con-
stitutional amendment.

The letter of Sherman
Adams on the subject might
have been expected. He is
already, as the assistant to
the President, a sort of gen-
eral factotum.

His letter to the Kennedy
subcommittee says in ef-
fect that, while he (Mr.
Adams) knows of no ob-
jection to the creation of a
new office, he believes that
it is not necessary.

The Adams letter must
be read in the light of the
fact that no matter who is
President, a spirit of in-
tense jealousy resides in
those who surround that
great seat of power. The
various helpers and assist-
ants are much more con-
cerned in keeping their own
powers and prerogatives
than in relieving the Presi-
dent of his burdens.

I happen to have been a
firsthand witness to this
for many months in the
first Roosevelt administra-
tion. When F.D.R. took
over, it was found that Hoo-
ver had established three
secretaries to the President
with equal rank and an ad-
ministrative assistant.

â˜…

Louis Howe, who was not
only a sick man at the time,
but an intersely jealous
man, saw to it that he was
the only person who would
hold the title of secretary.
Steve Early and Marvin
McIntyre were made "as-
sistant" secretaries-much
to their amazement and
chagrin.

I had been scheduled for
the post of administrative
assistant, but Howe ar-
ranged that that office be
abolished and that I be
given a job as Assistant Sec-
retary of State, a post with
no statutory duties in for-
eign affairs. This resulted
in endless confusion be-
cause my activities were al-
most entirely those of a
Presidential assistant.

*

But for a brief span, un-
til he died, Louis Howe en-
joyed plenary power, with
no end of confusion and
with the bestowal of a
burden upon the President
that would have broken a
person of less capacity for
detail.

In the present instance,
therefore, the opinions of
those around the President
should be taken with a
large helping of salt. Only
by definitive action of Con-
gress can the President be
relieved And the advice of
Mr. Hoover should be re-
garded as most reliable and
most disinterested.
