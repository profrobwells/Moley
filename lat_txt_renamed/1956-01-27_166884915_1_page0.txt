DISTAFF
POWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is abundant evi-
dence that the women of
the nation may decide the
1956 election and that
their decision may well
take a conservative turn.
Apparently the Eisen-
hower candidacy in 1952 at-
tracted hundreds of thou-
sands if not millions of
women whose interest in
politics had never before
been aroused. I can offer
only sheer speculation con-
cerning the reason for this
uprising.
Perhaps it was the Ko-
rean war that stirred their
concern for the lives of
their menfolk.
Perhaps it was the sim-
ple fact that a moral issue
was presented by the cor-
ruption in the Truman ad-
ministration.

Perhaps housewives
were concerned about the
vanishing purchasing pow-
er of their dollars.
In any event, their pref-
erence for a change mani-
fested itself in a big way.
It is reported that the po-
litical agencies of organ-
ized labor, notably the CIO-
PAC, are deeply worried
about keeping the wives of
their members in line.
There is news that the di-
rector of women's activities
of the CIO has started a
"family participation" pro-
gram. The PAC is putting
women on its various com-
mittees. Conferences have
been held to "correlate the
ballot box with the bread-
box."
This sudden interest in
women reveals a certain
naivete on the part of these
political brains in labor.
The fact is that women
have been associating the
ballot box with the bread-
box for some time and
have learned certain ele-
mentary lessons in econom-
ics that their husbands
seem to have missed:
They realize that every
time a great labor victory
has been won, such as the
victory of the automobile
union last spring, the
prices of things have a way
of going up. Fortunately
for the political bosses of
labor, inflation has been
quieted in the food area.
But this is at the expense
of the farmers and not be-
cause of anything that
labor statesmen accom-
plished.
★
The naivete which I
mention is revealed in the
fact that the people in la-
bor who direct strategy
failed to note that their
brethren across the sea in
the British Labor Party
awakened after the election
in 1950 to find that their
majority in Parliament had
melted away, in part be-
cause the wives of trade
unionists were jolly well
sick of the blundering ad-
ministration of the gov-
ernment's rationing and
food-buying policies.
In that campaign I heard
from more than one re-
porter who had toured the
provinces that labor wives
were asking whether there
was any way for their hus-
bands to find out how they
voted.
In the vote last fall in
Ohio on the CIO-initiated
ballot providing for bigger
unemployment benefits it
was clear that labor wives
were unwilling as taxpay-
ers to pay for the long
vacations of people whom
they regarded as drones
and incompetents.

A polister who studied
the 1952 election returns
reported that many labor
wives were beginning to
realize that their financial
status entitled them to be-
long to the so-called "white
collar" class and that they
were following that group
into the Republican Party.
The high command of
the Republican Party is
quite aware of this weak-
ness in the opposition and
is not planning to relax its
effort to win more and
more active participation
by women in its local cam-
paigns.
In doing this it should
realize, however, that wom-
en's votes are not won by
a special appeal to women
as such. Women resent be-
ing set apart as a special
class.
The wise political policy
is to merge their interests
with those of men and to
make the same appeal to
them as is made to men.
The women are aroused—
that is certain—but their
desire is to be treated as
equals, not as special prob-
lems.
