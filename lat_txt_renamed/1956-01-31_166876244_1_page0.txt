The promotion of the
"Draft Warren" movement
has been star-crossed from
the beginning. As a matter
of cold politics, its promo-
tion by Democrats and
others of somewhat doubt-
ful Republicanism would
fatally impair it so far as
support by organization
Republicans is concerned.
This is the sort of thing
I mean: A week or so ago I
heard a person whose ideas
always come straight from
the Democratic National
Committee headquarters
say that the Republicans
should nominate Warren
for President, and Lodge
(H. C.) or Clare Luce or
Margaret Chase Smith for
Vice-President.
There have been other
lethal kisses. For example,
Joseph L. Rauh, head of the
ADA, said some time ago
that the nomination of
Warren by the Republicans
would cause that left-wing
adjunct of the Democratic
Party to scratch its collec-
tive head in making a
choice between him and
Stevenson or Kefauver or
Harriman. It would in effect
be a "luxury," a cup for the
ADA overflowing with
goodness.
Adlai Stevenson is re-
ported to have said that if
he were to be opposed by
Warren, it would be
difficult to find anything to
talk about.
It might be suggested
that Democrats for Warren
as a Republican candidate
may have been thinking of
making campaigns more
economical. If the ideologi-
cal bond is so strong be-
tween the Chief Justice and
the former Governor of
Illinois, they could use the
same campaign trains in
stumping the country. That
would save a lot of money
for both parties.
Indeed, in that case why
have an election at all?
Save all that burden on the
State and local taxpayers.
It would be an enlargement
of the idea which seems to
have failed, that the two
parties raise money by a
joint effort. A sort of com-
munity fund for candidates.
The reason given by
President Eisenhower
for his unwillingness to fa-
vor Warren as a candidate
—that the court should be
kept out of politics—is a
good and valid one. But
the President has learned
enough about politics to be
fearful of Greeks bearing
gifts and Democrats sug-
gesting Republican candi-
dates.
It may well be that the
zeal of Democrats for War-
ren and their vicious at-
tacks upon Nixon stem
from the same root of self-
interest. Perhaps Nixon
plays too rough.
However, there is anoth-
er reason why the Warren
movement would never
succeed. The Dewey fac-
tion of the Republican Par-
ty is firmly and actively
opposed to Warren. That
difference goes back to the
campaign that wilted in
1948.
The Dewey people blame
Warren's campaigning for
the loss of many Republi-
can votes. They say that
whenever and wherever
Warren spoke in that cam-
paign, Republican workers
suddenly lost their zeal.
The result was that vast
numbers of Republicans
simply sat out the cam-
paign and the election.
Moreover, Dewey and
Warren disagreed rather
violently on the issues of
public power and social-
ized medicine. Dewey tak-
ing the conservative side
on both questions.
Perhaps the Dewey peo-
ple believe that Warren is
too old and that Nixon is
too young. Dewey is by
that calculation exactly
right. He is 11 years
younger than Warren and
11 years older than Nixon.
What an amazing coin-
cidence
