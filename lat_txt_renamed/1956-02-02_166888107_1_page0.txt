LESS TALK,
MORE DAM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In a notable speech last
week before the National
Republican Club in New
York, Gov. Robert E. Smy-
lie of Idaho hailed progress
in his State in moving to-
ward the solution of a pow-
er shortage by the work
now being done by the
Idaho Power Co. on its
projected three power
dams in Heli's Canyon,
He said that the people of
Idaho were now going to
get "kilowatts instead of
conversation." His attitude
toward the Idaho Power
Co.'s plan rather than the
Federal plan, which has
been favored by public
power groups together with
all and sundry Democratic
politicians who have spo-
ken on the subject, is char-
acteristic of all officials
elected at State-wide elec-
tions in Idaho for years.
In election after election,
the voters of Idaho have ex-
pressed their preference
for the private company's
plan.

And now, despite wintry
weather in one of the most
desolate and inaccessible
gorges in the nation, the
Idaho power project to
build three great power
dams is making rapid prog-
ress. Years of time have
been lost in political war-
fare over this issue in Con-
gress, on the hustings, and
before the examiner of the
Federal Power Commis-
sion.
The plan for a $500,000,-
000 Federal dam as an al-
ternative to the $180,000,-
000 three-dam project of
the Idaho Power Co, had
been before Congress for
more than five years and
Congress consistently re-
fused to authorize it.
The Truman administra-
tion prevented action by
the Federal Power Commis-
sion on the Idaho power
plan by a dog-in-the-man-
ger policy of opposition.
Finally, the Eisenhower
administration, through
Secretary McKay, removed
the roadblock, and the
FPC exhaustively consid-
ered the private company's
application for a period of
more than a year and a
half. It approved the proj-
ect last summer.
The Morrison-Knudsen
Co., a notable and expe-
rienced construction firm,
in the course of the hear-
ings before the examiner
of the FPC, gave a firm
pledge that it would if se-
lected do the job for $133-
000,000, which was accept-
ed by the company as its
estimate.

After the license was is-
sued and the way cleared
for action, the Idaho Power
Co. employed Morrison-
Knudsen to build the proj-
ect. This company carries
great prestige for its work
on the Grand Coulee, the
Bonneville, Hoover and
Hungry Horse Dams. It is
now working particularly
hard to make up for the
time wasted in political ma-
neuvering.
Immediately after the
contract was signed, M-K
(as Morrison-Knudsen is
known in the Northwest)
moved in with men and
equipment. Miles and miles
of transmission lines are
already built, no small
achievement when it is con-
sidered that the crews were
working partly in solid
rock and partly in frozen
earth.
In January a great inter-
state bridge was under con-
struction. A trailer court
has been laid out, and at
the first of the three dam
sites there is excavation
preparatory to the building
of a tunnel through the
rock.
This is private enterprise
at work backed by a State
which is interested in elec-
tricity at the lowest cost
and best service, and which
has decided that this serv-
ice can best come from its
own Idaho company.
