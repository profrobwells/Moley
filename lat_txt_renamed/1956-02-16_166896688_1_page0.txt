THE PROPER ROLE OF A CHURCH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his capacity as chair-
man of the now dissolved
national lay committee of
the National Council of
Churches of Christ in the
United States, J. Howard
Pew has issued a final re-
port comprising more than
300 pages.
A perusal of this book not
only describes the long con-
flict between this commit-
tee of laymen and the pro-
fessional clergy, but raises
sharply the proper role of
the church in the public
life in the nation.
*
The history of this par-
ticular controversy covers
five years, during which in
countless meetings and
communications, and with
many resolutions and
declarations of policy on
both sides, it became evi-
dent that a deep ideologi-
cal fissure had been opened
and that the professional
clergymen had no inten-
tion of acceding to the inter-
pretation of the council's
role by the laity.
Specifically, Mr. Pew
points out in his letter ac-
companying the report that
the premise of the lay com-
mittee was that the church,
instead of appealing to gov-
ernment on sundry issues
of civil public policy,
"should devote its energies
to the work of promoting
the attributes of Christian-
ity—truth, honesty, fair-
ness, generosity, justice
and charity—in the hearts
and minds of men."
He believes that the Na-
tional Council (which suc-
ceeded the Federal Coun-
cil of Churches of Christ in
1951) should avoid making
public judgments in cur-
rent secular affairs and
"economic or political con-
troversy having no moral
or ethical content." Fur-
ther, that the council
should avoid such secular
judgments because they of-
fer the implication at least
that the council is speak-
ing for 34,000,000 Protes-
tant laymen.
This issue is not new. As
long ago as 1790 Edmund
Burke in his incomparable
"Reflections on the Revolu-
tion in France," devoted
most of the first few pages
to his regret that certain
English clergymen with
little background to justify
their conclusions should
have rushed into a defense
of the revolutionary ele-
ments in France.
*
In the present instance,
the officers and executives
of the national council have,
as in the case of the federal
council before them, gone
on record with all sorts of
judgments on questions
upon which there were
wide differences among the
laymen who made up the
membership of the church-
es which, after all, are the
constituent elements in the
national council.
What we have here, ap-
parently, is almost precise-
ly what has happened in
the field of public educa-
tion. It is the emergence of
a professional elite which,
after tightly organizing it-
self, has the temerity to
speak for great masses of
people who are unable to
speak for themselves. It
was a careful distillation of
the NEA elite which ulti-
mately controlled the re-
cent White House Confer-
ence on Education and pre-
sumed to tell the Congress
of the United States what
to do about matters on
which the information of
the elite itself was profess-
edly scanty. The elite, or
rather, those members of
the elite who came to the
surface, were devoted to
the Federalization of the
schools.
*
In the case of the Nation-
al Church of Church-
es, the ideology which is
portrayed by the various
stands taken on public
questions is an increasing
aggrandizement of govern-
mental power and of the
Federal government over
the States.
The cold fact is that the
congregations of most of
these ministers are just as
well informed and as capa-
ble of understanding as is
the clergy itself, and with-
in every congregation there
are members who are vast-
ly better equipped to deal
with matters of public poli-
cy than the clergyman who
presumes to speak for
them,
