COAL AND ALUMINUM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The favorite argument
hy exponents of more and
more Federal investments
in hydroelectric projects
in the Northwest is the
shortage of power in that
region. That shortage of
power has in the past been
largely caused by the immense
concentration of the
aluminum industry there.
Farsighted people have
commented many times
that such a preponderance
of one industry there was
not wholly desirable for
the industry, for the region
or for the Federal
Treasury.
To begin with, the industry
was risking the
danger of finding in the
not-too-distant future that
with more efficient coal-
burning plants it would become
less and less profit-
able to maintain plants at
such a distance from their
markets. The region for
some time has realized that
the aluminum industry was
consuming a very large
amount of its available
cheap power, while by comparison
with many other
industries it provided jobs
for a small number of
workers. The Federal government,
meanwhile, was
heset by politicians from
the Northwest for more
and more money to build
vast power installations to
meet the "shortage."

It is now becoming clear
that a revolutionary change
is taking place in the aluminum
industry. Big companies
are beginning to
make major investments in
plants close to coal mines,
notably in the coal-rich
Ohio Valley.
In announcing plans for
a large new aluminum reduction
plant and an aluminum
sheet, plate and
foil-rolling mill at Ravens-
wood, W.Va., D. A. Rhoades
of the Kaiser Aluminum &
Chemical Corp. pointed out
the advantages of the new
site:
1—The availability of
water transportation for
the shipment of raw materials
and products;
2—Nearness to the aluminum-consuming
markets;
3—Availability of very
large amounts of economic
coal-derived electric power,
with adequate long-range
coal reserves nearby.
Mr. Rhoades concludes:
"The real significance of
this combination lies in the
fact that the aluminum industry
is no longer necessarily
dependent upon locations
close to large hydroelectric
installations which
are remote from industrial
markets. We are convinced
that this development will
greatly influence and benefit
the domestic aluminum
production pattern of the
future. We believe that it
is a turning point for the
rapidly expanding aluminum
industry."
Kaiser is only one of a
number of companies
which are finding new sites
in the Ohio Valley. Olin
Mathieson Chemical Corp.
has announced the building
of a large new plant on the
Ohio River near Clearington,
O. To provide power
there will be immense new
installations in which the
American Gas & Electric
Co. and the Pittsburgh Consolidated
Coal Co. are interested.

Philip Sporn, president
of American Gas & Electric,
points out that "where
coal lies on navigable water
—and this is true in a large
section of the Ohio Valley—
it offers today an ideal combination
of favorable economic
factors for the development
of large-scale,
economical coal supplies
needed in large-scale aluminum
operations."
The only people in the
Northwest who need to be
worried about this development
are the rabid exponents
of public power at any
cost. A much more balanced
industrial life will result
from this easing of the
strain upon power resources
by the aluminum industry.
More jobs will be available,
and the political life of
such States as Washington
and Oregon will not much
longer be dominated by the
issue of public power.
This will also be welcome
news to a depressed coal industry.
