WHITE HOUSE LOBBY FOR UPPER COLORADO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As this is written, two
representatives of
the White House staff are
feverishly lobbying among
members of the House,
seeking votes for the im-
mense Upper Colorado rec-
lamation project.
Presumably this is in
keeping with the Presi-
dent's agreement with Sen.
Watkins to give his all to
this proposition to spend
hundreds of millions in
Utah, Colorado, Wyoming,
and New Mexico putting
arid land into.cultivation.
If the sponsors of the
project have their way,
1,228,845 acres will be wa-
tered, of which about one-
third will be new land and
two-thirds will be land
Sen, Watkins
President appointed a com-
mittee to guide him in such
instances. Secretary of the
Interior McKay was chair-
man of the committee, and
Secretaries Benson and
Wilson were members.
That committee made a
recommendation in its re-
port which is completely
ignored. The committee
recommended that in such
cases as this there should
be set up "an independent
board of review. . . to an-
alyze the engineering and
economic feasibility of
projects and report to the
President."
No such board has been
set up in his case, de-
spite the plain fact that
there are very serious
engineering, agricultural,
and financial doubts about
the soundness of this proj-
ect.
A profoundly important
question concerns the en-
gineering soundness of the
plans for the biggest unit
in this whole project, the
half-billion dollar Glen
Canyon Dam. It has been
brought out that along the
sides of the canyon above
the site of the dam are
great deposits of what is
known as "chinle shale."
When the water in the res-
ervoir behind the dam
rises, it is charged on good
authority, this shale will
disintegrate and wash in-
to the reservoir, thus de-
stroying the usefulness of
the dam for storage.
★
Moreover, the plans for
this dam provide for a
much more flimsy struc-
ture than that of the
Hoover Dam. It would be
wider, straighter, and less
substantially built at the
bottom. That raises an en-
gineering doubt that
should be resolved before
any such authorization is
granted.

Secretary McKay
The Department of Agri-
culture reports that there
is serious doubt about the
estimates by the Bureau
of Reclamation of the agri-
cultural benefits in the
land involved.
The financial estimates
are altogether shaky. It is
seriously doubted whether
the electricity developed
can be marketed for the
price estimated in the
plans. Moreover, long be-
fore the revenues from the
power plants have paid for
the irrigation, those plants
may be worn out.
★
And on the entire proj-
ect the farmers could pay
only about 15% of what it
would cost the Federal
government to put the
water on the land.
To say that this project
is self-liquidating is to give
currency to a monstrous
untruth.
All these doubts should
be resolved before the
House acts. But it may
well be that because of ad-
ministration pressure, and
logrolling among mem-
bers, and political deals of
other sorts, this monstrous
piece of waste will be en-
acted.
ently irrigated but which
will get additional water.
★
At the same time, the
administration, includ-
ing presumably the two
White House emissaries
mentioned above, is at-
tempting to get votes for
its soil bank plan, which
will put 30,000,000 to 40,-
000,000 acres of land out of
cultivation — land plenti-
fully watered by nature
and without any benefit of
Federal irrigation.
Of course, this is incon-
sistent, but when politi-
cians are spending tax
money consistency is a
minor consideration. In
fact, the President himself
in his annual message rec-
ommended the soil bank in
one paragraph, and in an-
other urged this immense
expenditure to increase
production.
There is, however, an
even more glaring incon-
sistency in the administra-
tion's policy on this meas-
ure. Nearly two years ago,
when this Upper Colorado
project was first approved
by the administration, the
