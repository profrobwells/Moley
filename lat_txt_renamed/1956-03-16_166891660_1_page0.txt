The rumor wheels were
whirring before the an-
nouncement of Secretary
McKay's decision to con-
test Sen. Morse's seat had
fairly reached the streets.
"They" were saying that
the President had forced
McKay out because he was
unhappy about his record
and that he felt that the
man from Oregon would
be a handicap in the com-
ing campaign.
This came fast on the
heels of the flood of rumors
that the President was
covertly forcing Vice-Pres-
ident Nixon out while pub-
licly commending him.
The President nailed them
at his press conference but
there will be many, many
other rumors of the same
sort. That seems to be the
way some people feel is the
most effective to attack
the President.
In the McKay case I
have made it my business
to get the truth. And here
it is. Morse is a formidable
antagonist. He represents
a philosophy against which
the President has consist-
ently declared himself.
★
The fight in Oregon will
be watched over the whole
nation. In general. Morse
has chosen the subject of
debate, which is public
power and the conserva-
tion of our natural resourc-
es. He claims that public
power should be expanded
and private power further
contracted. He claims that
the Eisenhower adminis-
tration has been "giving
away" our precious natu-
ral resources and that Sec-
retary McKay has been the
evil agent of this policy.
The fight in Oregon would
in any event therefore be
for or against McKay.
The Republican high
command in Washington
has not been satisfied with
the way the opposition to
Morse has been shaping up
in Oregon. There seemed
to be no one, after the
death of Gov. Patterson,
who could fight Morse with
sufficient vigor and knowl-
edge.

Naturally there would be
no one out there who could
know as much about the
McKay record as the Sec-
retary of the Interior. Thus
he was the natural cham-
pion of one of the most vi-
tal of all the Eisenhower
policies—"partnership" in
the development of our
natural resources. In this
instance McKay was the
indispensable man.
There is an additional
point. McKay has been
very successful in Oregon
policies. He was a State
Senator for some time. He
was a popular and success-
ful Governor. He is a pep-
pery, intelligent and
forceful campaigner, well
experienced in campaign-
ing and capable of the sort
of rough going which an
opponent of Morse must
encounter.
Oregon, despite its in-
terest in natural resources,
is a private power State.
Not since 1940 has a sin-
gle Oregon county voted
for public power. It is a
Republican State and a
conservative State. With
an articulate and vigorous
campaigner fighting for
conservative principles, the
sentiments of the State
should reveal themselves.
For that reason McKay
should win.
