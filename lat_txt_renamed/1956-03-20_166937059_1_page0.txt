Judge Stanley N.
Barnes, Assistant Attor-
ney General in charge of
antitrust law enforcement,
is preparing to relinquish
a task which has puzzled
and frustrated many men
before him. He goes, as
those who have preceded
him in this job have gone,
from a policing job in
which nobody is punished
much, nobody is reformed,
and, in fact, nobody can
ever know what is wrong
and what is right. And pre-
sumably, as in the case of
dozens of predecessors,
there will be relief in a job
in which the making of
law yields to doing what
can be done with laws
made by somebody else.
But Judge Barnes made
quite a bit of noise in this
post-almost as much as
did Thurman Arnold
whose turn to the novel in
law and literature was, for
a brief moment, well
known.
There is nothing star-
tling about the frustration
of Judge Barnes. He struck
the same dilemmas that
have puzzled government
lawyers ever since Sen.
Sherman sponsored his
original law 66 years ago.
The only thing that is re-
markable is that he should
have been constrained to
believe he had discovered
something.
It was a good deal like
the routine discovery of
crime by every young Dis-
trict Attorney. Crime so far
has survived generations of
District Attorneys, and the
antitrust problem has sur-
vived decades of Judge
Barneses.

The retiring Assistant
Attorney General will be
remembered as the man
who threatened General
Motors with action under
the antitrust laws on the
ground that monopoly can
be measured by a mathe-
matical percentage of its
share of the industry's busi-
ness. Pressed to be specific,
he decided that if GM got
rid of its Oldsmobile di-
vision, this would be about
right.
Judge Barnes will also be
remembered for a while as
the man who stalled the
proposed merger of Beth-
lehem Steel and Youngs-
town Sheet and Tube be-
cause he or his superior,
the Attorney General,
would not give assurance
that a decision would be
expedited after the merger
to determine its legality.
The point here is that
there is a provision in the
antitrust laws by which
the government may in
such a merger ask a Fed-
eral circuit court to con-
sider the case "of general
public importance," after
which the court may ap-
point three judges to give
the matter expeditious
treatment. This would
seem to be a reasonable
way to determine the issue.
But the Justice Department
has not followed it.
The basic principle that
Judge Barnes seems to miss
is that the moment the
government makes eco-
nomic judgments such as
cutting loose Oldsmobile or
the undesirability of more
steel competition in the
Midwest, it is taking into
its hands problems of man-
agement with which it is
not equipped to cope,
either by experience or
comprehension of the facts.

Moreover, the size of a
corporation is determined
by the judgments of mil-
lions of customers. To cut
corporations to a size
roughly determined by the
Department of Justice is
not the road to more but
rather less competition.
For that method creates a
managed economy.
This is the end of the
road for all Assistant Attor-
neys General in charge of
antitrust law enforcement.
Judge Barnes takes his
place in the endless suc-
cession,
