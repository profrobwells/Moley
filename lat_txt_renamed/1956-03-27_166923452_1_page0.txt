Long ago, when the
American labor movement
was the AFL and the AFL
was the labor movement,
even Samuel Gompers re-
ferred to his creation as a
"rope of sand." Recent
events tend to show that
the merger of the AFL and
CIO, if not a rope of sand,
is certainly not a very
strong chain.

The long Westinghouse
strike and its outcome re-
veal almost all of the in-
ternal weakness of the
merger.
The impulsive, militant
man who was responsible
for the strike, James B.
Carey, must regard his own
future as uncertain now,
after his men, 55,000 in
number, find themselves
after 156 days of idleness
out of pocket some $100.-
000,000.
Despite his efforts to get
support from the new fed-
eration or some of its con-
stituent parts, Carey found
himself practically going
it alone. Some unions, it
is true, put a faint hand
into their bulging treas-
uries but came up with
only token sympathy doles
for the relief of Carey's be-
leaguered members. The
widely discussed general
strike never materialized.
And suggested sympathetic
strikes in industries serv-
ing Westinghouse failed to
come off.
In February, Carey, an
ambitious colleague, if not
a rival, of Walter Reuther
among the top brass of the
eight-man executive com-
mittee of AFL-CIO, went
to Miami Beach with live-
ly hopes of getting some
united action in his support
from leaders convened
there. He found to his bit-
ter regret that the only
thing that the other labor
leaders were united upon
was a determination to
steer clear of any united
action in support of the
Westinghouse strike.
The more astute among
the chieftains assembled
there well realized that any
such action on their part
would give substance to
the accusation that labor
had formed an all-powerful
and monopolistic monster.
They wanted to provide
no such weapon for their
opposition.

Strenuous denunciations
of and dire prognostica-
tions about the new con-
federation from some quar-
ters when the merger took
place last year have not
been borne out by develop-
ments. There has been lit-
tle visible integration.
Differences that have per-
sisted as open sores for
years, have not been re-
lieved, let alone healed.
Jurisdictional feelings and
conflicts persist.
It has yet to be demon-
strated that the merged
organization from a politi-
cal standpoint "speaking
with one voice" will prove
more effective than the two
organizations which gen-
erally took the same posi-
tion on public issues, but
with two separate voices.
Ultimate effects of the
Westinghouse strike will
take time to assess. Al-
ready the cost in business
to Westinghouse amounts
to some $200,000,000. It is
certain that industrial ex-
pansion has been delayed
from one end of the coun-
try to the other. The com-
pany is known to have lost
several huge electrical
equipment orders in the
last four months. Loss of
prestige, that hard - won
commodity, has undoubted-
ly been suffered by the
company. This cannot help
but adversely affect the
man working at a bench,
management, and the econ-
omy in general.
