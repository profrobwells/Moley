CRUCIAL TEST OF THE UNION SHOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The U.S. Supreme Court
has on its docket this
spring a case challenging
the constitutionality of the
union shop amendment of
the Railway Labor Act.
That amendment, passed in
1951, permits a railway
and a union to agree to a
union shop, regardless of
any prohibition by a State.
There are 18 States which
have such legislation,
either by statute or consti-
tutional provision. This
case is one of 20 now pend-
ing in the courts.

In 1953 the Union Pacific
Railroad and a number of
unions agreed to a contract
making union membership
a condition of employment.
A man named Robert L.
Hanson, who is a non-
union worker employed by
the Union Pacific in Ne-
braska, refused to join the
Brotherhood of Railway
and Steamship Clerks,
Freight Handlers, Express
and Station Employees.
The railroad notified Han-
son and other employees
that they must join or lose
their jobs. Thereupon,
these men secured an in-
junction against their dis-
charge.
The Supreme Court of
Nebraska unanimously
ruled that the Federal
union shop amendment
was unconstitutional be-
cause it violated the right
to work and freedom of as-
sociation guaranteed by the
First and Fifth Amend-
ments of the United States
Constitution. It held fur-
ther that since the Federal
law permitting the union
shop is null and void, the
provisions of the Nebraska
constitution govern the
case.
The Nebraska constitu-
tion provides that "no per-
son shall be denied employ-
ment because of member-
ship in or because of
refusal to join or affiliate
with a labor organization;
nor shall any individual or
corporation or association
of any kind enter into any
contract . . . to exclude
persons from employment
because of membership in
or nonmembership in a
labor organization."
The basis of the concept
of a "right to work" lies
in many decisions invali-
dating discriminatory post-
Civil War legislation
against persons participat-
ing in the Confederacy.
Forty years ago Charles
Evans Hughes as a justice
of the Supreme Court de-
clared that the right to
work for a living is "the
very essence of the per-
sonal freedom and oppor-
tunity it was the purpose
of the amendment to
serve." That amendment
(the Fourteenth Amend-
ment to the Constitution of
the United States) of course
refers only to States. The
Fifth is a prohibition on
the Federal government.
The principle, however,
stated by Justice Hughes
it is hoped by Hanson will
govern his case.
The other principle in-
volved is that of freedom
of association. Are men to
be forced into a private or-
ganization or do attempts
to make them join consti-
tute a violation of the First
Amendment?

It is interesting to con-
trast the principles es-
poused by so-called liberals
a quarter century ago with
those which they assert
now. The Norris-La Guar-
dia Act, certainly the work
of two outstanding liberals,
declared the policy of pro-
tection of the right to join
as well as to refuse to join
a labor union. Freedom of
choice was the slogan of
those days.
Now, however, labor
leaders interpret freedom
of choice to apply only to
freedom to negotiate un-
ion shop contracts. Thus
by shifting the emphasis,
the group gains power at
the expense of the individ-
ual.
