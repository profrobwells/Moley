ON SEROV'S
RECORD
BY RAYMOND MOLIY
While the allegedly
cherubic Malenkov smiled,
kissed babies and shook
hands with all comers in
London, the time arrived
to prepare for the two char-
acters who supplanted him
in his job as Stalin's sue-
cessor Khrushchev and
Bulganin.
As an advance agent for
these dignitaries, whose
job it is to see that no harm
befalls them in capitalist
England, there arrived
Gen. Ivan Serov. The gen-
eral's arrival signalized the
the appearance of a new
marvel of Soviet power, a
jet plane of considerable
range.
The Soviet could hardly
have selected a more inap-
propriate ambassador, even
though his duties are
limited to police work. For
Serov is a past master of
mass deportation and a de-
voted and. energetic prac-
titioner of the worst ex-
cesses of the Stalin regime.
It was Serov who han-
dled the "Sovietization" of
the Baltic states in 1940
after they had been forci-
bly absorbed into the
U.S.S.R. Briefly, his job was
the removal of those whose
continued existence on
their native soil might im-
pede the suppression of the
Baltic peoples into the So-
viet mold.
His handling of the mat-
ter was most effective. Ele-
ments of the population re-
moved in tightly packed
railway cars to the interior
of Russia included mem-
bers of non-Communist po-
litical parties, officials of
the previous regime, for-
mer employees of foreign
governments, and business-
men, landowners, religious
leaders and, of course, for-
mer Communists. The
heads of families in these
and other categories were
carefully separated from
their kin, never to see them
again.
Serov's directives were
picked up by the Gestapo
in World War II and even-
tually fell into British
hands. An example of his
model orders reads: "Oper-
ations shall begin at day-
break. Upon entering the
house of the person to be
deported, the senior mem-
ber of the brigade shall as-
semble the entire family in
one room, taking all neces-
sary precautions against
any possible trouble...
The convoy of the entire
family to the station shall
be effected in one vehicle
and only at the station of
departure shall the head of
the family be placed sepa-
rately in a car especially
designed for heads of fam-
ilies..."
The British press was
not slow in publishing de-
tails about this man. And
the public reaction has in-
dicated what a mistake it
was to send him with such
elaborately planned public-
ity. The British Socialist
press expressed deep regret
at this embarrassing in-
truder into the daydreams
of coexistence in which the
Labor Party has been im-
mersed.
Indeed, they can now
find ample material for a
portrayal of what would
happen to them if Commu-
nists ever take over. For
the ferocities of Serov were
especially visited upon the
Socialists in the countries
he ravaged. At the head of
the long list of the people
who were marked for sum-
mary deportation from the
Baltic republics were
"members of the dissolved
bourgeois political parties,"
including specifically "So-
cial Democrats."
The appearance of Serov
in such a prominent role
belies the claims of Soviet
leaders that any new spirit
has seized them. In fact,
the pattern of terror and
suppression now followed
by the secret police against
Stalin's fellow Georgians is
the same as that which pre-
vailed in the Stalin rule of
terror.
