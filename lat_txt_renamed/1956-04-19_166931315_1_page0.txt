FARM VOTE CRISIS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For months we have
been hearing about a seeth-
ing revolt among the farm-
ers all over the area
between the Appalachians
and the Rockies.
We have been told that
frantic calls for help at any
price have been coming
from Republican Party
leaders to the White House
and to the national com-
mittee in Washington.
A bit of inquiry, salted
with a pinch of common
sense, convinced me that
there is no such party
crisis. The "farm vote" is,
of course, not the least, but
it is certainly not the great-
est of the President's re-
election problems.
To be sure, the primary
votes in Minnesota, Wis-
consin and Illinois have
done something to allay
anxiety.
★
In Wisconsin the normal
Republican vote seemed
safe except in the area near
the Minnesota border in
which has always been in-
clined to the radical ten-
dencies characteristic of
rural Minnesota and North
Dakota.
In Illinois the results in-
dicate a fairly normal Re-
publican vote in the south
and a normal Democratic
vote in Chicago.
The big Eisenhower vote
in Milwaukee was gath-
ered with no apparent ef-
fort by the Republican
organization.
However, my feeling that
the importance of the farm
vote and, consequently,
the farm "revolt" are great-
ly exaggerated is not de-
rived from these scattered
primary results, but from
an examination of that
grim record of all human
affairs—the census. The
conclusion is that the farm
vote is far less important
numerically than is as-
sumed even by seasoned
politicians.
As everyone knows, the
census tells us that the
"farm population" has been
declining relatively at a
terrific rate. In 1940 it was
30,000,000, or 23% of the
total population of the
United States. In 1950 it
declined to 25,000,000, or
16%. In 1955 it slid to 21,-
700,000, or 13% per cent.
This drop in 15 years, from
23 to 13%, throws all com-
parisons of voting with
past farm "crises" into the
discard.
But if Republicans wish
to evaluate the farm vote
they should deduct from
the 21,700,000 the approxi-
mately 44% of those peo-
ple who live in the South
and who are in general
Democrats. That leaves
12,000,000 in the 36 States
in the North and West.
Let us estimate that two-
thirds of these people are
in Republican families.
That leaves 8,000,000. But
only two-thirds of these
are old enough to vote.
That leaves 5,300,000. Fi-
nally, after applying a con-
servative deduction of 40%
stay-at-homes (the absen-
tee vote is generally high-
er), we have a little more
than 3,000,000 who must be
reckoned as active farm
Republicans.
Various tests show that
as of this date Eisenhower
will not lose more than
25% of the people who
voted for him in 1952.
That means a possible loss
of less than 1,000,000 scat-
tered over 36 States.
But you will be told that
the farm vote is not all
that farm distress will lose.
How about the shopkeep-
ers, etc., in the towns and
cities who depend upon the
farm trade?
★
On this point I offer the
result of a straw vote which
over the years has been
quite reliable. It was taken
in Shenandoah, Ia., by Ra-
dio Station KMA of that
city and covered 1523 peo-
ple who were in town at a
merchandise show. Over
all, the preferences were
983 Eisenhower, 317 Ke-
fauver, 129 Stevenson, 48
Truman, 21 Harriman, 3
Symington (Shenandoah is
close to Symington’s State)
and 1 Marlon Brando.
The voters living in the
city preferred Eisenhower
over Kefauver, 558-116.
Those living on farms pre-
ferred Eisenhower over
Kefauver, 250-156. This
would seem to indicate
that the townspeople, even
in a city in a farming re-
gion, are still for Eisen-
hower.
There will be some losses
in farm regions and a few
Congressmen may be in
danger. But the real fight
will be for the urban vote
this year.
