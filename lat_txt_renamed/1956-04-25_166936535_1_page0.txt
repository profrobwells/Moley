HEALTH
ISSUE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is quite apparent that
Democratic leaders will
persist in making attacks
upon the health-preserving
routine which the Presi-
dent's doctors have pre-
scribed and which the
President, with an honesty
and frankness never
equaled, described to the
country.

Only last week Demo-
cratic Chairman Paul M.
Butler offered the follow-
ing comment.

"The American public is
making it clear that it does
not want a part-time Presi-
dent. I, for one, am shocked
at the President going off
on another golfing holiday
in the midst of the Middle
East war crisis."

*

With variations, this sort
of thing may be expected
from all leaders of Chair-
man Butler's party. It is
not likely, however, as
the full truth and wisdom
of protecting the Presi-
dent's health—in fact, any
President's health—are
made clear, that the Ameri-
can public will have any
reservations. For the pre-
scription offered for the
maintenance of the Presi-
dent's health is simply
what ought to be followed
by any man of 60 or more.

In that connection, the
wife of a New York physi-
cian, Richard Boies Stark,
has brought to my atten-
tion a most interesting ad-
dress made in 1929 by Dr.
Seale Harris of Birming-
ham, Ala., before the Med-
ical Society of Virginia.
(The address is printed in
the Virginia medical
Monthly, January, 1920.)

Dr. Harris discussed at
some length the health of
Presidents and measures
taken to protect them
against the rigors of their
office. He said that when
he saw and heard Wood-
row Wilson in 1911, "we
feared that he would not
have the physical strength
to live through even one
term as President of the
United States. The impres-
sion that Woodrow Wilson
was not a strong man
physically was later con-
firmed by information ob-
tained... from confidential
conversations with his
physician, Adm. Grayson."

*

Later, after Wilson had
been in the White House a
year, Dr. Harris saw him
again and was impressed
by his "look of rugged
health." Wilson told him
that his well-being came
from following the orders
of Adm. Grayson. So Dr.
Harris asked Adm. Gray-
son what he had pre-
scribed. The routine pre-
scribed was:

"1—Nine hours' rest in
bed at night.

"2—A few minutes' phys-
ical setting-up exercise be-
fore the morning bath.

"3—A carefully regu-
lated diet, eliminating cane
sugar and its products en-
tirely.

"4—One hour rest period
at noon.

"5—Not more than eight
hours work a day.

"6—A walk or ride in the
open air and sunlight every
day.

"7—Golf two or three
afternoons a week."

This routine thus pre-
scribed was followed for
six years until the peace
conference and its rugged
aftermath. The tragic re-
sult afterward we all know.

*

The question is whether
the routine prescribed for
the Republican President
Eisenhower differs in any
marked way from the pre-
cautions prescribed for the
Democratic President Wil-
son. I fail to find any sub-
stantial difference except
for the more restricted diet
prescribed for Wilson and
the hour's rest at noon in-
stead of the half-hour for
Eisenhower.

So far as golf is con-
cerned, it is merely a dif-
ferent arrangement of time.

We may hope that when
Chairman Butler gets a lit-
tle older he not only will
have something more im-
portant to say but will him-
self recognize the wisdom
of preserving one's health.
We fear, however, that the
chairman may not live to
be 60 unless he calms
down.
