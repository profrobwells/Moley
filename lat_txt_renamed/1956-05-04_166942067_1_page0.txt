SPENDING
RACE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Before this Congress
completes its labors this
summer, we taxpayers may
be asking ourselves wheth-
er we can really afford
Presidential elections. For
this one promises to be the
most expensive in history.
Both parties are reckless-
ly bidding for our votes—
with our money.
The race began with the
President's budget in Jan-
uary. It seemed at that
time that the administra-
tion was attempting to ac-
complish two ends by pro-
posing very large and ex-
pensive programs in high-
way construction, agricul-
tural subsidies, school
building, health, welfare,
and natural resources de-
velopment.
The magnitude of the
proposed outlays suggested
that the administration
was attempting, first, to get
credit for any new services
and benefits that might be
granted by Congress; sec-
ond, to prevent a Demo-
cratic attempt to cut taxes
on small incomes only.
Despite heavy spending
in the present fiscal year,
ending June 30, a small
margin of surplus was pre-
dicted. Nevertheless, the
President recommended
the extension of two taxes
which were scheduled to
expire—the "temporary"
increase in corporation tax-
es, and certain excises.
Twice the Secretary of the
Treasury has warned that
spending will be higher
than was anticipated.

But the prospect of rec-
ord-breaking April tax pay-
ments has whetted the ap-
petite of Democrats for tax
cuts, and Sen. Kerr propos-
es the increase of individ-
ual exemptions from $600
to $700 this year and to
$800 next year.
The more disturbing
prognosis is not what will
happen this year but what
will be in store for the
fiscal year beginning on
July 1. Most of the big
programs, if enacted, will
fall into that period. There
is the soil bank program,
the highway program and
Social Security additions.
The school building pro-
gram would begin in fiscal
1957, but that is likely to
be stymied on the segrega-
tion issue.
Then there are the big
annual appropriation bills.
Six of those have been
passed with a total con-
siderably in excess of the
President's requests. This
reverses a practice which
began in 1953 when the
House of Representatives
was more thrifty than the
President and very materi-
ally cut his requests.
Finally, the big money
bills are still to come. For-
eign aid is likely to be very
large and, with Democrats
claiming that the adminis-
tration is starving defense,
another billion is likely to
be added to the President's
requests.

Not the least of the
grabs at the Treasury are
a series of bills sponsored
by Senators from mining
States continuing the buy-
ing of a whole series of
minerals for defense stock-
piling. These are not es-
sential, because stockpiles
are already in existence
sufficient to fight a couple
of world wars. They are
plain and simple subsidies
of industries which have
been enjoying record-
breaking prosperity for
some years.
Meanwhile, many other
projects are coming out of
the Congressional wood-
work. Everyone seems to
have friends in Washing-
ton—except the taxpayer.
