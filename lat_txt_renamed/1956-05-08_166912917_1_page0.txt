INSURING
ATOMS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Clinton Anderson,
chairman of the Joint Con-
gressional Committee on
Atomic Energy, has an-
nounced that he plans to
hold hearings during the
week of May 14 on a bill
to provide Federal liability
insurance up to $500,000,-
000 against any major
atomic reactor accident
that might spread injurious
materials over a wide area.
The Senator has commu-
nicated his plan to com-
panies which are engaged
in constructing or are plan-
ning to construct reactors
for the generation of elec-
tricity. Presumably the in-
surance companies which
may be interested will also
be heard at that time.
After a good deal of con-
sideration, insurance com-
panies have indicated that
they would be willing to act
as a group to provide un-
derwriting up to $65,000,-
000. The Anderson pro-
posal would have the Fed-
eral government take over
beyond that amount. The
Senator recognizes that
even $500,000,000 might be
inadequate and would have
any damages beyond that
provided for by special leg-
islation.
In the production of
atomic power there are, in
addition to the normal risks
of experimental enterprise,
safety hazards which are as
yet unknown. Each new
power reactor differs from
earlier ones. What has
been learned about past
design and experience does
not wholly apply to proj-
ects for the future, and the
AEC has been notably cau-
tious in approving permits
for construction.
Dr. Frank Pittman of the
AEC characterized a re-
actor as "potentially a
dangerous beast" and add-
ed: "We won't be hurried."
Beyond the localized
dangers involved in the
production of atomic power
is another, incalculable
threat. While a reactor
accident might not release
widespread radioactivity,
the release of lethal gas or
smoke is not impossible.
That could affect a consid-
erable area and endanger
a great many people. It is
that contingency that un-
derlies the need of disaster
insurance in an amount
never before calculated.
Under the circumstances,
an electric company might
be faced with damage
claims far beyond its
resources. It simply could
not afford the risk, however
important the new means
of generating power might
be.
On the other hand,
insurance companies have
no history to use as a guide
in assuming atomic risks.
Even when they act as a
group, then possible losses
are formidable.
In this instance the
government with its enor-
mous resources would seem
to be the only means of
spreading a risk involving
great and indeterminate
liabilities. Later, as experi-
ence accumulates, the bur-
den can be taken over by
private companies. Above
all, the introduction of
atomic energy into civilian
industry should not be
delayed.
