THE FATAL
FALLACY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

During the last month I
have made two trips to
California and back to New
York. In the course of the
more recent of these I
made stopovers in Chicago,
Kansas City and Wichita.
My general political ob-
servations which follow
are not based upon any
considerable "feeling of the
pulse" of the citizenry on
the way. My travels were
not made for that purpose.
I hesitate to impose upon
readers stories such as I
have occasionally noted by
a reporter who, after talk-
ing with Hammar Lunkin,
farmer, and Richard Me-
kan, implement dealer, and
Minnie Miskis, housewife,
is able to report that Iowa
is seething with discontent.

*

All I can report on the
political atmosphere after
these trips is gained from
a number of people who
might be called leaders of
opinion and in their cases,
from what they asked
rather than from what
they answered-from read-
ing the excellent newspa-
pers which I encountered
on the way, and from my
own reflections, enriched, I
hope, by my experience in
many campaign years of
the past.

There can be little doubt
that Messrs. Stevenson and
Kefauver are gravely bur-
dening the patience, not to
say the sense of humor, of
the people who hear or
read about their speeches.
One evidence of that is the
fact that a great majority
of the questions I have
been asked are about some-
one other than the tire-
some trio of Stevenson, Ke-
fauver and Harriman.
Symington, for example,
is a matter of interest even
in Kansas City, where peo-
ple ought to know a lot
about him. Also Johnson of
Texas. And Frank Lausche
of Ohio. My deduction from
these inquiries is that there
is a considerable interest in
finding somebody other
than the three-if one may
use the expression-front
runners.

*

There seems to be little
interest in how many mis-
siles we have or what the
Russians have. Or the sta-
tus of the Air Force. There
seems to be a willingness to
leave that sort of thing to
the expert, experienced
hands of President Eisen-
hower.

No popular indignation
is aroused by the Stevenso-
nian quips about business-
men in government. Some-
how, the businessman is no
longer regarded as a men-
ace.

A paradox emerges from
this failure of Democratic
statesmen to stir up inter-
est. This very indifference
may be a peril to the Re-
publican Party. For it cre-
ates the impression among
those who were stirred four
years ago to smite the par-
ty in power that there isn't
much to smite any more.
President Eisenhower is
loved, respected and ac-
cepted, just as are the
spring flowers and the re-
turn of longer and warmer
days. He is something that
there is nothing much to do
about except to enjoy.

*

If this sort of atmosphere
continues to prevail, there
will be a record stay-at-
home vote in November.
Past elections, such as
1948, prompt me to place
no confidence in Republi-
can voters. They take too
much, including them-
selves, for granted.

This election, so far as
the preference of a majori-
ty of voters is concerned, is
in the bag. But unless
somebody turns the bag
upside down and shakes it,
there will be a very light
Republican turnout in No-
vember. Since there will
be no lack of work by
many Democratic machines
in cities, energized not by
love of any Democratic
candidate for President but
by concern for local tick-
ets, and since Walter, Vic-
tor and Roy Reuther will
be spending millions of
money and will employ
thousands of workers in an
effort to corral obedient
Congressmen, there may
be a big surprise on elec-
tion day.

At the moment, a great
political calm prevails-an
Eisenhower calm with
plenty of apathy on all
sides. Apathy born of the
fatal fallacy that anything
in politics can be taken for
granted.
