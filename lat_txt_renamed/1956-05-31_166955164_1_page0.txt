THE WAR
ON SPEED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

On these summer holi-
days and week ends reck-
less and speedy drivers are
not going to find Connecti-
cut a safe place to show
their stuff. But for mod-
erate drivers it will prob-
ably be the healthiest spot
in the nation.
To intensify a campaign
against fast drivers Gov.
Abraham A. Ribicoff for
Memorial Day provided for
his regular police force an
addition of 100 National
Guardsmen, 42 jeeps and
three helicopters. He ap-
parently reached the con-
clusion that a day set apart
to honor the dead might
well be dedicated to keep-
ing more people alive.
*
The result of the Gover-
nor's measures for the
three-month period ending
April 1 was a reduction of
deaths due to traffic acci-
dents. The Connecticut
death toll was reduced 15%
from the figure in 1955, al-
though there were 94,000
more licensed drivers and
many more automobiles on
the highways.
The rigor of the Gover-
nor's campaign was shown
by the fact that during that
three-month period nearly
3000 drivers' licenses were
suspended. Moreover, the
fact that the presence of
active police and effective
enforcement has a restrain-
ing influence has been
shown by steady decline of
arrests. It requires little
demonstration that the
scared driver is likely to be
a safe driver.
I had occasion two weeks
ago to witness the restrain-
ing effect of the Governor's
measures in the course of
an automobile trip through
the State and return the
following day. Drivers were
certainly on their good be-
havior. Whereas in past
years everyone assumed
that a driver could exceed
the prescribed limit by 10
or 15 m.p.h., there is no
such assumption now. It
was indeed a refreshing
experience.
*
Whenever in the past I
have ventured the opinion
in print that the real peril
is speed and the real rem-
edy is more active and
more numerous police, I
have had many letters ex-
pressing different views.
Some claim that poor high-
ways are to blame and that
the remedy is more billions
of Federal money. An ob-
session of many others is
that the manufacturers are
to blame because of the
greatly increased horse-
power in the newer cars.
Finally, there are those
who would limit the speed
of cars mechanically.
Many thousands of miles
on the highways every year
convince me that these me-
chanical matters are inci-
dental. The horsepower
race among manufacturers
is a bit silly. But the care-
ful driver made more cau-
tious by strict policing does
not use all of his power.
And arbitrarily and me-
chanically to limit the
speed of cars would not
make much difference.
*
Gov. Ribicoff is proving
that the law and its strict
enforcement are best and
that the enemy of the peo-
ple is speed.
There has been plenty of
complaining by drivers, of-
ficials and the newspapers
of neighboring States about
what is called the Connecti-
cut "speed trap," and I
heard some grumbling
from Connecticut people.
But since plenty of notice
is given, the word "trap"
hardly applies, and I found
no one who has been seri-
ously inconvenienced by a
little highway restraint.
Moderation well befits the
many charms of Connecti-
cut. It's a fine place to
spend a holiday.
