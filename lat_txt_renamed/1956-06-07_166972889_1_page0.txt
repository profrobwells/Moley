RFC AND JESSE JONES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It was said in 1934 by one
of Jesse Jones' major as-
sistants that practically
everything that the as-
sorted alphabetical agen-
cies were doing could be
done under the powers of
the Reconstruction Finance
Corp. alone. This was meas-
urably true, and if in any
case there was need for ad-
ditional legislation it was
possible for Jones to get
practically any amend-
ments he needed to the
original RFC act.
Jones, as well as Presi-
dent Hoover — who ap-
pointed the Texan to the
RFC in 1932 — felt that the
depression was essentially
a crisis of confidence and
credit. Banks were weak
because their assets were
frozen and also because
they were generally operat-
ing with insufficient capi-
tal. Railroads were loaded
with old debt and crippled
with obsolete methods of
operation. Farmers were
paying too much for their
borrowed money and were
glutting the market with
surplus crops.
It was the task of the
RFC to put the strong arm
of government credit under
the tottering credit struc-
ture. This disposition of the
resources of the govern-
ment through the RFC
came to be the major re-
sponsibility of Jones.

His problem with the
banks was twofold. First
he had to open the ones
which he felt had the ca-
pacity to resume business.
This was largely achieved
by the Jones plan of buying
preferred stock to give the
institutions some cash with
which to resume. After the
resumption of business, it
became his unpleasant
duty to induce the bankers
to take measures which
would assure future stabil-
ity. In this he was finally
successful, despite the hide-
bound conservatism of
many of the leading mem-
bers of that fraternity.
With the railroads, the
course was to awaken their
management to the hard
facts of a competitive
world. RFC loans helped
them get on their feet, but
after that he was compelled
to teach them to get out and
hustle for business and to
improve the attractiveness
and efficiency of their serv-
ice.
Meanwhile, for 12 long
years of New Dealism Jones
was able to keep the fingers
of visionary and Socialistic
officials in other depart-
ments out of the vast re-
sources of the corporation
of which he was head.
No doubt, President
Roosevelt would have had
Jones out long before he
did if he had not feared
the ire of Congress. For
Jones was high in the af-
fections and confidence of
Democrats and Republi-
cans alike. Vice-President
Garner once said: "Jesse,
Congress has given you
powers which no man
ought to have, and I know
of no one but you who
could get them."

Robert A. Taft, as a new-
comer in the Senate and a
strict constitutionalist, ex-
pressed amazement at the
powers exercised by Jones,
but quickly recognized the
necessity of granting them
and the fact that Jones
could be trusted not to
abuse them. They became
warm friends.
Twice Congress granted,
with hardly a dissenting
vote, a type of personal
legislation almost without
precedent. When Jones be-
came Secretary of Com-
merce, Congress by special
legislation permitted him
to carry along his control
over the lending agencies.
Five years later, when the
President, ill and irrespon-
sible, dismissed Jones be-
cause he wanted to pay a
political debt to Henry
Wallace, Congress immedi-
ately divorced the lending
powers from the Depart-
ment of Commerce.
★
Jones will live in history
not merely as a major
builder of a great city and
as a public administrator
who handled 50 billion dol-
lars without a scandal but
as an economic statesman
of great stature. No one in
the official family of Pres-
ident Roosevelt will even
approach his rank in the
calm appraisal of history.
