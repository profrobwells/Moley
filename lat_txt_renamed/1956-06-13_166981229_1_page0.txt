HOUSING
RIGHT?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In a bill backed by the
Eisenhower administration
it was proposed to au-
thorize the construction of
35,000 additional housing
units a year for the next
two years. The Senate, in a
burst of pre-election gener-
osity, passed a bill up-
ping the figure to 135,000
units a year until the
1949 goal of 810,000 units
has been attained.

Since, under the Housing
Act of 1949, 315,500 units
will have been contracted
for up to July 31, 1956,
there would be 494,500
remaining to be built. It
would therefore be possi-
ble to continue the pro-
gram approved by the Sen-
ate, of 135,000 a year, for
a total of nearly four
years.

The President, however,
is authorized in the bill
passed by the Senate to
taper down the amount of
building each year from
135,000 to 50,000, or to in-
crease the amount to 200,-
000 in a given year. Even
so, this is a big commit-
ment of public money to be
made at a time when there
are already growing signs
of a surplus of housing.

The people who are ac-
tively lobbying for more
and more Federal money
for housing point out that
the building already pro-
jected, with vast areas of
slums wiped out, will dis-
place 123,000 low-income
people a year for three
years. Thus it is assumed
that every family with a
low income that is being
moved out of its present
quarters is not only enti-
tled to a place to live but
that it has a vested right
to a new home.

The idea that there is a
right to a house — and a
new house — is being ac-
tively promoted. Perhaps
we shall see this idea vin-
dicated by a politically con-
scious Congress in our
time. It is, however, worth
while to consider the ques-
tion whether the many
rights that we are accept-
ing can be granted without
a fundamental change in
the form of government
and society under which
we are living.

One of the more frank ex-
pressions of the idea of
housing as a right was stat-
ed by Catherine Bauer
Wurster, first vice-presi-
dent of the National Hous-
ing Conference:
"The contribution of the
Webbs and their co-work-
ers to housing education
was to bring out the unde-
niable fact that houses are
merely the next step in that
increasing line of public
services and utilities which
now includes water sup-
ply, street paving, trans-
portation and such mat-
ters. Every individual is
just as much entitled to
a minimum of shelter as he
is to a minimum of clean
water, and the conditions
of a complex industrial so-
ciety make it unavoidable
that governments should
themselves assume the re-
sponsibility for providing
both."

This "principle," bor-
rowed as we see from
those oracles of British
Socialism, the Webbs,
comes very close to official
sanction in the 1949
Housing Act itself:
"The general welfare and se-
curity of the nation
require . . . the realization
as soon as feasible of the
goal of a decent home and
a suitable living environ-
ment for every American
family."

The so-called declaration
of human rights of
UNESCO includes housing
as a right.
Needless to say, all
Americans possessed of
goodwill would like to see
increasingly better stand-
ards of living by all and
would put recent housing
high in the factors of that
standard. But a bit of seri-
ous thought should be giv-
en to the idea that hous-
ing is a human "right"
guaranteed by law and
government.

The multiplication of
rights may go so far that
the entire concept of right
may fall. For only a gov-
ernment vested with a ty-
rannical authority can pos-
sibly fulfill the requisites
of Socialism. And such a
government must of neces-
sity deny certain basic
rights that we already en-
joy.
