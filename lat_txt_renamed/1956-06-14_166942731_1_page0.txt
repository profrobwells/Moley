Carmine G. De Sapio,
Gov. Harriman's Secretary
of State, leader of Tam-
many Hall and Democrat-
ic National Committeeman,
has suddenly become front-
page news and a figure of
national importance. This
is because he is the man
who contrived the nomina-
tion of Averell Harriman
for the Governorship of
New York and now seems
to be managing the Harri-
man drive to nominate the
New York Governor for the
Presidency.
*
It is of great importance
to note that the Tammany
leader is not so enlightened
as the late Charles Mur-
phy and is more discreet
than was Dick Croker at
the turn of the century. He
has just engineered a job
in Manhattan, however,
that has its parallels in the
dark ages of the Hall.
He has defeated and de-
stroyed the Congressional
career of the man who de-
feated and ended the ca-
reer of the notorious Red
party-liner, Vito Marcanto-
nio.
The 18th New York Dis-
trict has quite a reputation.
Its boundary runs along
the East and the Harlem
Rivers up into the region
called East Harlem, heavi-
ly populated by Puerto Ri-
cans. For seven terms it
elected the late Vito Mar-
cantonio to Congress.
During that period, as is
well known, Marcantonio
followed in his votes a line
which must have endeared
him to the Kremlin. To-
ward the end of his long
reign and his leadership of
the extremely dubious
American Labor Party, de-
cent citizens attempted to
unseat him.
*
In 1946 a spirited cam-
paign was carried on, the
climax of which was the
cold-blooded murder of a
Republican leader named
Joseph Scottorigio. Mar-
cantonio won. The murder-
er was never apprehended
and possible witnesses in
the dangerous streets of
East Harlem discreetly
clammed up.
In 1948 Marcantonio won
again. In 1950, however,
Tammany was constrained
to join with the Republi-
cans, and a Democrat,
James G. Donovan, was
elected over Marcantonio,
whose American Labor
Party was slowly fading
away.
Donovan was re-elected
in 1952 and 1954. Since I
am a resident of the 18th,
and since I know Donovan
well, I can testify to the ex-
cellence of his record in
Congress and his sincere
and intelligent qualities as
a public servant.
However, it is the ambi-
tion of the De Sapio ma-
chine to be master of all
Manhattan, and it was de-
cided that good government
had gone far enough. Con-
sequently, Donovan was
repudiated and Tammany
put up a faithful servant
for Donovan's seat. Money
flowed in plenty, and rough
work was reported over the
district during the cam-
paign. On election day the
police protection was dou-
bled.
*
In the northeastern cor-
ner of the district, largely
inhabited by immigrants
from Puerto Rico, unbe-
lievable activity by hood-
lums, bookies, and num-
bers runners was reported.
One report had it that
the bookies were offering
free chances on races to
prospective voters. The re-
sult in that particular sec-
tion, which was always the
unsavory core of Marcan-
tonio's power, was that the
final vote was 3089 to 232
against Donovan.
Three conclusions, rath-
er melancholy ones, can be
drawn from this episode.
First, it shows that Tam-
many has not changed its
stripes. Second, that the
entire Pink and Red ele-
ment that made up the
American Labor Party has
moved bag and baggage in-
to the Democratic Party.
Finally, that the so-called
good citizens of the district,
who were really aroused in
1950 dropped into compla-
cent inaction after a few
years of decency.
Thus De Sapio, a man
who has the effrontery to
appear on the national
scene sponsoring a Presi-
dential candidate, succeed-
ed in purging the man who
purged Marcantonio.
