Partisan sources are
charging that the optimis-
tic opinion of the Presi-
dent's physicians concern-
ing his future physical
fitness is propaganda. Thus
the integrity of these medi-
cal men has been chal-
lenged and the public is
consequently confused.
Since the material so far
offered to the public is
sketchy and deceptive, I
asked a friend who is a
competent surgeon to sur-
vey the available literature
on the disease for which
the President was treated
and to interpret to me what
he found.
★
This precaution on the
part of a layman is impor-
tant since so much of what
is authoritatively published
in medical journals needs
translation from medical
semantics. The result of
this survey abundantly
supports the verdict and
predictions of the medical
men who attended the
President.
The real issue comes
down to the probability of
the recurrence of the dis-
ease, ileitis, and the capac-
ity of the President to serve
another term.
There are several articles
on the subject, two of the
most pertinent of which are
published in the journal
Gastroenterology.
One of these articles was
published in 1954 and is
entitled "Regional Enter-
itis Report for Mayo
Clinic." It considers 600
cases from 1912 to 1949.

Apparently some of the
confusion and misrepresen-
tation which have been
created by partisan sources
are due either to a misread-
ing or an incomplete repre-
sentation of some of the
tables in this study which
show the numbers and per-
centages of recurrences of
the disease. The figures
quoted by one pessimist
would have you believe
that the President is almost
certain to have a recur-
rence. That is because the
statistics used by these
people include all ages of
patients and all types of
the disease,
Thus, account is not
taken of the fact that the
recurrence rate is much
lower among older people
and that the President had
a rather mild form of the
disease.
The Mayo report makes
this very important point:
"The recurrence rate was
high among patients who
were between 31 and 40
years of age and low among
those who were more than
51 years of age."
In the Mayo compilation
there were only nine cases
in the age group above 51,
and only two of these had
recurrences.
★
Indeed, it is made clear
in the literature on the
subject that ileitis is a
young people's disease.
The other important
article, also published in
Gastroenterology, appeared
in 1951, Its title is "An
Appraisal of the Long Term
Results of Surgical Treat-
ment of Regional lleitis."
It was signed by Dr. John
H. Garlock, with the col-
laboration of Dr. Burrill B.
Crohn and others. Dr.
Crohn was a pioneer in the
study of the disease, and it
is often called "Crohn's
disease." The authors were
at the time of publication
connected with Mt. Sinai
Hospital in New York.
The first survey of the
cases was taken in 1945.
There were 57 cases in
which the operative method
used on the President was
employed-i.e., "ileocolos-
tomy with exclusion."
(This means bypassing a
diseased section of the
intestine without the re-
moval - resection - of any
part.)
It was impossible to
check on 10 of the cases,
so the actual number
studied was 47. Among
these there had been six
recurrences by 1945. That
is about 12%. In three of
these recurrences the sur-
geons employed resection
(removal). These patients
were well in 1951. In two
cases, evidence of recur-
rence was discovered by X
ray, and recovery was
achieved without further
surgery. In one case there
was extensive involvement,
but the patient was report-
ed to be getting along with-
out surgery in reasonable
comfort.
★
In 1951 the 47 cases were
checked again and it was
found that five more had
recurrences. These recur-
rences, it should be noted,
developed several years aft-
er the original operation.
All were well, with the ex-
ception of one case, which
was doing "poorly."
It should be noted that
these cases are from all age
groups.
The conclusions that can
be reached from these data
and other sources, includ-
ing accounts of the Presi-
dent's case, are:
1-The President's case
of ileitis was, in medical
terms, "a low grade, cica-
trizing, terminal ileitis." It
probably began several
years ago, perhaps between
10 and 20 years ago. The
description means that
there would have been
small, successive flare-ups
followed by scarring.
Thus it progressed to a
point at which about 10
inches were involved in
scar tissue. Unlike most
cases there was no exten-
sive agute inflammation
and there were no compli-
cations. There were also no
"skip" areas, which are in-
termittent diseased spots in
healthy areas. The Presi-
dent's case was much more
mild than is usual in this
disease. This would be
a most favorable circum-
stance so far as the avoid-
ance of a recurrence is con-
cerned.

2-Recurrence is much
more likely if treated sur-
gically in the early stages
of the disease. In the Pres-
ident's case, treatment was
in an advanced stage after
scarring.
3-As is indicated above,
recurrence is much less
likely in a man of the Pres-
ident's age.
4-It has been said that
since the Presidency in-
volves serious mental and
nervous strain, recurrence
might well occur just as
ulcers are developed for
that reason. Dr. Garlock
disposed of this point in the
discussion of the paper
cited above:
"We are convinced by
rather prolonged observa-
tions by the psychiatrists
at our hospital that there is
nothing to indicate a psy-
chosomatic basis for this
disease." Dr. Crohn in an
interview in U.S. News &
World Report said that
hard work by the President.
after recovery from an op-
eration would not increase
chances for a recurrence.
★
5-Finally, and most im-
portant, there is the great
respect which must be ac-
corded the men who were
present at the President's
operation and who partici-
pated in the press confer-
ence later. Gen. Heaton,
who performed the actual
surgery, is highly respected
in his profession. Dr. Isidor
Ravdin, a major consult-
ant, is a specialist of great
distinction. The statement
that there is no reason why
the President should not
run again must be taken as
a serious and responsible
expert opinion.
