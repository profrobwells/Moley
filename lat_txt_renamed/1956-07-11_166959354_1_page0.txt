I can understand the indignation of Washington correspondents over the permission which was granted to one of their number, Robert J. Donovan, to examine the private records of Cabinet meetings and other papers inaccessible to the press and to publish his interpretation thereof in a book, "The Inside Story." There can be no doubt about the unfairness to the press generally in this decision of the White House secretariat. There is a certain amount of raw material in the book, however, which provides an excellent means of judging the quality of some of the President's advisers during the past three and a half years, There were wise people and there were foolish people in that inner circle. And we can only offer up thanks that the advice of some of those bad advisers was ignored by the President. In my judgment, the hero of the book is the quiet-spoken but very wise Secretary of the Treasury, George Humphrey. The wisdom and balance of this man was vividly shown during the big economic scare late in 1953 and in the early months of 1954. ★ Signs that the economy was slipping were present in September, 1953, and were the subject of Cabinet discussion. The economy was in the process of recovering from the impact of peace in Korea. After several worrisome days, Secretary Humphrey, who believed in the great effect of stimulating business confidence, announced late in September that the tax cuts scheduled to take place at the end of the year would go through on schedule. This sign of confidence was strengthened by the assurance of Economic Adviser Arthur Burns that the economy was basically sound and that his group was thinking less about government spending and more of shifts in monetary policy and tax reduction. By November, however, there was more alarm, and Democrats like Sen. Douglas and Walter Reuther were crying for a dose of New Deal spending stimulation. Meanwhile, with the new year, unemployment continued to rise, and the President began to toy with all sorts of spending ideas. ★ Humphrey stood by his belief in private spending and so expressed himself at a Cabinet meeting in January. In February and March almost everybody in the group had ideas about spending — McKay for building more dams, Stassen for lowering the interest rate on housing. March came, with still more unemployment and with the government spenders in full cry. Stassen was for more government purchasing. Even Nixon was for some sort of action, although the record does not specify what sort of action. But Humphrey, sustained by Burns, kept his head and contended that the real thing that was retarding business was uncertainty over the passage of the tax bill. By April, however, favorable omens began to appear, and by June the air was clear and things were on the way up. During all of those months the President, while indicating great uneasiness and while practically all of his advisers were urging an emergency spending program, followed the advice of Humphrey and Burns. The facts amply justified their foresight and the President's confidence in them. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
