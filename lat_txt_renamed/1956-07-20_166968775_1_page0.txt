BUSINESS IN POLITICS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Once more in this cam-
paign the voice of the dem-
agogue is abroad in the
land. Candidates for the
Democratic nomination and
lesser fry like Chairman
Paul Butler are telling us
that businessmen cannot be
trusted in public office. We
are told that they are pred-
atory, heartless and be-
nighted.

This is uttered not only
in the harsh tones of a
Harriman but in the gentle
insinuations of a Stevenson.

It is interesting comment
from them. Apparently in-
herited money qualifies a
man for the management
of great affairs. Earned
money does not.

This sort of thing is not
new. We have heard it for
a long time. Shrewd poli-
ticians believe that it gets
votes. And we should be
realists enough to realize
that in the long run they
may be right about that.

But the effect of this at-
tack upon businessmen is
indirect. It has its major ef-
fect upon businessmen
themselves, not upon the
generality of the voters.

I am not convinced that
many voters are unwilling
to trust businessmen with
public office, even men con-
nected with big business.
In the first place, a consid-
erable proportion of the
voting population is either
in business or connected di-
rectly with it by family re-
lationship.

Moreover, the American
people are showing their
confidence in business man-
agement in many ways.
They put their money into
banks run by businessmen.
They invest their savings
in securities dependent up-
on the skill, foresight and
honesty of business man-
agement. And they spend
billions for the products of
American manufacturers.

No, the effect of the anti-
business talk of politicians
is not directly on the vot-
ers. It has its effect upon
the businessmen them-
selves. It has imparted a
sense of inferiority and
helplessness to business-
men. It has generally kept
them out of direct partici-
pation in politics.

Because it has seemed
good politics for politicians
to be antibusiness, it has
come to be widely believed
that it is good business to
stay out of politics. Hence
business, which has such
a great stake in what gov-
ernment does these days,
has substantially left the
field of politics open to pro-
fessional politicians and to
the politicians in the labor
movement.

This is a great loss to
the public service of the
country. For men and
women experienced in bus-
iness management have a
great contribution to make
in politics. They know how
to organize appeals to the
mass mind. Those engaged
in the sales side of busi-
ness know the arts of per-
suasion. They have the
capacity not only to get a
story over to voters but
to persuade volunteers to
help in the process.

I imagine that politicians
will deny my assertion that
political work is essential-
ly like salesmanship in
business. My answer to
them is that politicians in
general are a generation or
more behind the times in
their methods of cam-
paigning. They waste large
sums of money in outmod-
ed and ineffectual appeals
to the public. And the rea-
son that this discrepancy
has not been more appar-
ent is that both sides are
equally incompetent.

I have in mind, however,
a number of cities in which
businessmen have 'awak-
ened to their responsibil-
ities and have made nota-
ble progress. In another
article I shall describe
some of the methods they
have used. For it seems to
me that businessmen must
take a greater part in pol-
itics or the management
of their businesses will be
taken out of their hands by
politicians in government.
