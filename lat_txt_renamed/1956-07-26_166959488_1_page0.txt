SEATTLE—The name of
Don Magnuson, Congress-
man-at-large from the
State of Washington, sug-
gests two aphorisms—one
of which must be answered
and the other denied.
The first is, "What's in
a name?" The answer is
that in the case of Don
Magnuson there can be a
lot of votes in a name. The
other is that the whole is
the sum of the parts.
Magnuson proved that
there can be exceptions to
this almost self-evident
truth.
Don Magnuson was a
humble sort of a fellow
until the light dawned
upon him that with his
name he might go far in
politics. For another Mag-
nuson, Warren, no kin of
Don, was and had been for
a considerable time a well-
known Senator. Don ran
for his present office in a
Republican year, but un-
doubtedly because of a
slight matter of confused
identity he won as a Demo-
crat.
The strange part of it
was that while he won in
a State-wide vote, all of
the Republican candidates
in the six Congressional
districts of the State also
won.
This year, however, Don
may wish he had never
been born a Magnuson, for
Sen. Warren Magnuson
may well meet defeat at
the hands of the able and
popular Gov. Arthur Lang-
lie. It may well be that,
despite Don's earnest toil
in Congress, people will
again mistake him for War-
ren and vote against him.
At any rate, his seat is
held by a slim margin and,
with Eisenhower and
Langlie on the ticket, we
may see the end of both
the Magnusons.
The campaign for the
Governorship, which is be-
ing vacated by Langlie
after an unprecedented
three terms, offers another
singular feature. In this
case the next Governor,
assuming that the Republi-
cans sweep the State in
November, will be selected
in the September primary.
One candidate is another
Don, whose other name is
Eastvold, now Attorney
General. Eastvold attained
a certain national prom-
inence when he appeared
on the platform in behalf
of Eisenhower during the
stormy scenes in Chicago
four years ago.
This brash, willowy
young man appeared to be
the veritable breath of a
new generation. Here, the
dedicated supporters of
Eisenhower declared, was
the voice of a brighter day
for America. He was, in the
eyes of millions, for a mo-
ment, a political Sir Gala-
had.
After the wear and tear
of four years his glamour
is less notable. But his
appeal to youth is still
potent. Against Eastvold
is a much more mature
statesman, Emmett Ander-
son, Lieutenant Governor,
who has a great deal of
appeal to the older and
wiser citizens of the State.
Gov. Langlie had some
reservations about Ander-
son, but with Eastvold as
an alternative, Langlie is
for his Lieutenant Gov-
ernor.
The Democratic candi-
date for Governor will
probably be Albert D.
Rosellini, who is a well-
known State Senator and
who represents the more
radical point of view.
The real battle in the
State will be the effort of
Langlie to win the Sena-
torial seat of Warren Mag-
nuson. It is early to pre-
dict—and in this contest
it may continue to be too
early to predict—but with
Langlie’s undoubted ability
and voter appeal, and with
the State rapidly turning
away from its former addic-
tion to New Deal nostrums,
the President’s party may
pick up a valued Senate
vote in this contest.
