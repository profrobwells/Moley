RAYMOND MOLEY:
Spend and Elect Is
Still Legislative Way
From time to time I have
in these articles comment-
ed upon the melancholy
fact that a free govern-
ment may sometime spend
itself into chaos or worse.
I once expressed the idea
in a question: "Can we af-
ford to be free?"
The spending record this
year, for which both Con-
gress and the administra-
tion must share the blame,
is one of the most awe-in-
spiring in our history.
It used to be thought
that a profligate monarch
was the most expensive
luxury under heaven. But
there was passed in Con-
gress during the session
just concluded, and signed
by the President, a sum of
money which would have
appalled the Napoleons, a
Louis or two, and several
Roman emperors.
*
It was a race to buy
votes in which the real
loser will be the voters
themselves - plus, of
course, the millions too
lazy and indifferent to vote
at all.
The only place where
there was a burst of econo-
my was in foreign aid. For-
eigners cannot vote this
year. We decided not to
build the Aswan Dam.
Egyptians have no votes.
But we are going to build
dams at Flaming Gorge,
Navajo and Curecanti be-
cause there are Rocky
Mountain Senators to elect.
When you hear glowing
accounts of the "accom-
plishments of the party"-
and this will apply to both
parties-think of the fol-
lowing cold record (figures
by the Tax Foundation):
*
For the fiscal year end-
ing in June, 1957, Congress
appropriated $57,200,000,-
000, which was slightly be-
low the budget estimates.
But this is by no means the
whole story. In addition to
this, Congress appropriated
vast additional amounts in
spending "authority." This
means authorization to bor-
row from the Treasury and
to make contracts which
will obligate more spend-
ing.
There are also what are
known as "permanent ap-
propriations," which are
not included in the appro-
priation figures given
above. This brings the
"new obligational author-
ity" up to $68,600,000,000.
This is $2,300,000,000 above
the President's January
budget requests, which
seemed to be excessive
when made. It is $6,800,-
000,000 above what was
provided for the present
fiscal year, and $11,500,-
000,000 above the 1955 to-
tal.
But there are carry-over
balances of appropriations
of 74 billion dollars for
which the government
must find the tax money.
This means that we are in
for spending altogether, as
of now, 143 billion dollars.
Taxes, despite higher re-
turns from rates that we
already had, were raised.
*
There will be higher
levies on motor fuels, tires,
etc., to pay for new high-
ways. There will be higher
rates for Social Security.
And the "emergency" cor-
porate income and excise
increases which were due
to expire were extended
for another year. These
charges will, of course, ul-
timately be paid by the
consumer.
But even this is not all
that a profligate Congress
did. Authorizations of bil-
lions were made for such
debatable projects as the
huge Upper Colorado stor-
age plan. That will be paid
out of future appropria-
tions, for which this Con-
gress and administration
established a moral obliga-
tion.
*
There were also started
such programs as the soil
bank, which will go on year
after year. And only the
snag over segregation
saved us more spending for
schools which could very
well be built by local com-
munities.
The most distressing fea-
ture in this, as in other ses-
sions of Congress, was the
extent to which there was
trading of votes among
States and regions-logroll-
ing, it used to be called.
This was probably done in
a more brazen manner
than ever before.
All this to elect another
Congress which in turn
will appropriate and au-
thorize to elect just anoth-
er Congress, ad infinitum.
