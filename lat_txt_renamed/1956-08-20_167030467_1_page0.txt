The sanctification of par-
ty heroes is one of the most
amusing traits of American
polítics. This is well shown
in the current conventions,
when nothing except the
American Flag'is so certain
to bring applause to an ora-
tor as the mention of some
successful but departed
candidate for President.
I well remember, when
I was a small boy, an invi-
tation which my father, a
devoted Democrat, received.
and which announced a
Jackson Day dinner. In
some way the printer or
someone else was carried
away by the spirit of the
occasion and so the an-
nouncement read "St. Jack-
son," a compliment which
the Tennessee statesman
would have appreciated
when alive.
Even the events of a rel-
atively recent past are now
finding their way into his-
tory, embellished with re-
finements invented some-
where along the line.
This thought came to me
while I was examining a
new book, "Roosevelt, the
Lion and the Fox," by Prof.
James M. Burns of Wil-
liams College. For the most
part the book shows every
evidence of a desire to be
fair. But in some instances
the ardor of the artist in
Prof. Burns overcomes the
perspicacity of the histo-
rian.

One of those instances is
quite harmless but the oth-
er constitutes an unfair dig
at a worthy man.
The first is a romantic
account of F. D. R. writing
his first inaugural address,
all alone, apparently in the
presence only of the por-
traits of his ancestors. How-
ever, I also was present and
the President-elect was
merely copying the speech
from notes that had been
prepared earlier. Also,
the phrase "The only thing
we have to fear is fear it-
self" was not copied from
Thoreau. It was added to
the speech by Louis Howe.
A much more important
matter concerns an incident
in 1937. Sen. Joseph T. Rob-
inson, as is well known,
was promised a place on
the Supreme Court but the
appointment was withheld
for some reason. Mean-
while, under Roosevelt's
urging, Robinson as Senate
leader carried on a des-
perate fight for the bill re-
organizing the Supreme
Court. This resulted in a
fatal heart attack. Gen.
Hugh Johnson, a close per-
sonal friend of Robinson,
wrote in a syndicated col-
umn a strong criticism of
Roosevelt after the Sena-
tor's death.
Prof. Burns—apparently
relying upon the unreli-
able diaries of Harold
Ickes, a bitter enemy of
Johnson, and a story told
to Ickes by Roosevelt, who
was not always an accurate
authority for his own ex-
ploits—says that F.D.R.
called Johnson to account
about the column and said
that if Robinson were alive
he would call the author
thereof "a liar, a coward
and a cad." Burns ends the
tale thus:
★
"As Johnson's face red-
dened, Roosevelt slowly re-
peated the line. Then, ac-
cording to the President's
story, Johnson cried."
As a friend who con-
ceived a deep admiration
for the courage and integ-
rity of Johnson, I want to
put down the conclusion of
the story as Johnson told
it to me shortly after it
happened.
Johnson said that F.D.R.
did call him to his office
about the column and that
he said, "If Joe Robinson
were alive he would call
the author of this column
a liar, a coward and a
cad."
I imagine that Johnson's
face reddened, but with
righteous anger.
Johnson told me that he
answered thus:
"If Joe Robinson were
alive and he called me a
liar, a coward and a cad—"
And since Johnson had
just as much a flair for the
dramatic as F.D.R. and a
vastly quicker way with
words, he paused and con-
tinued:
"I would punch him in
the nose"—another pause
—"if he were President of
the United States."
That is what Johnson
said he said, and I never
found that he ever told me
anything but the truth.
But out of bits of gos-
sip is much of history
made and reputations im-
paired. That is why his-
torians should check their
materials
