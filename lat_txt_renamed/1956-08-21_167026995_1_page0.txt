THE PERIL
OF COPE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
SAN FRANCISCO—Despite the concentration of
attention this week on the
nominations for President
and Vice-President, and all
the enthusiasm of delegates
and the public about the
heads of the ticket, the
keenest minds in Republican
Chairman Hall’s very
large and very able national
committee staff are not
on the Democratic national
ticket.
While not taking the
election of their national
ticket for granted, they
conceive the danger to be
coming from a direction
other than the Democratic
candidates for President
and Vice-President.
Their real opposition
they conceive to be the
forces of organized labor,
now embodied so far as political
action is concerned
in the AFL-CIO Committee
on Political Education,
hereinafter known as
COPE. Indeed, the drive of
that formidable agency to
elect members of Congress
might very well be the
balance which could upset
Eisenhower.
*
It has been evident for
some time that while there
will be plenty of lip service
by AFL-CIO people to the
Democratic candidate for
President, they have pretty
well decided to use little
money and manpower to
help him. They will, as in
1948, shoot the works for
Congress.
As a preliminary to that
drive, COPE has published
for its workers a “Handbook
for Political Action”
entitled “How To Win.”
This is a detailed manual
of directions for workers
written in easy, colorful,
catchy prose illustrated
with drawings and photographs.
It has packed into
250 pages more practical
political shrewdness than
I have ever before seen portrayed
in any one spot. It
is a “how-to” book—“How
To Get Started,” “How To
Know and Be Active in
Your Community,” “How
To Get the Vote Out,” and
nine other chapters.
Any doubt about the concentration
of the labor
leaders on Congress can be
disposed of by a glance at
George Meany’s introduction
to this remarkable
book. He does not mention
candidates for President
and Vice-President. Rather,
he says:
*
“We consider it our duty
to participate actively in
the political life of the nation
and the community in
which we live and work…
The gains labor has made
at the collective bargaining
table are threatened in the
legislative halls of Congress
and the State legislatures.”
The degree of political
sophistication which the
directors of COPE have attained
is concentrated in
one pregnant passage in
the chapter on “How to
Know and Be Active in
Your Community:”
“Bear in mind that voting
habits don’t change
easily. Tradition, religion,
nationality, income, family
pressures and geography
tend to fix them quite firmly.
…But before you go
out to persuade a lot of other
people, concentrate on
your own members and
their families. If you can
get every member of your
union and his/or her family
to register and vote and
participate enthusiastically
in political action, you have
done a lot. In fact you have
done plenty, brother.”
*
That is perhaps the most
profoundly important lesson
that a political worker
can learn. Practically no
amateur politician realizes
it. Very few American professionals
know it. The
general gabbler about political
gossip never dreams
it. But the experienced,
hard-bitten workers in
British parties know it.
Tammany Hall always
knew it. And COPE knows
it.
Put in simple terms, it
means that politics is concerned
not with conversion
but with persuasion. Every
ounce of energy that is
spent in getting a person
who generally shares your
status in life, your ideas
and your prejudices to do
something about voting is
worth a hundredweight of
trying to convert a dedicated
member of the other
party. Mark well this COPE
lesson as you talk with
your neighbors this fall.
