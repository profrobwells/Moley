RAYMOND MOLEY:
Eisenhower's Speech
on Vital Conservatism
On the day before the
President made his accept-
ance speech the prediction
was buzzing around San
Francisco, running in some
headlines and expressed in
the views of commentators
on the air waves that in his
acceptance the President
was going to blast the lead-
ership of his party and
move the GOP so far to the
left side of the road that
nothing but the ditch
would be left to the Demo-
crats.
We can sympathize with
headline writers who after
the Stassen gaff could find
little of exciting conflict to
promise. Perhaps we can
also forgive the commenta-
tors their last bit of "Oh-
how-we-wish-Ike-were-not-
a-Republican" propaganda.
But the speech itself
turned out to be not only
soundly conservative but a
real affirmation of party
faith.
*
The speech bears evi-
dence of very careful prep-
aration and for that reason
may well be the basic Re-
publican document not
only in this campaign but
in years to come. It cer-
tainly is no ghost-written
packet of platitudes and
egg-head jargon. Of course,
it pays its respects to cus-
tomary political appeals in
calling itself a program
for "the future, not the
past." But the five major
reasons given for its claim
that the Republican Party
is the hope of that future
bear careful note. They
are:
1-The Republican Party
as defined by the President
is concerned with long-
range principle, not expe-
diency.
2-It is concerned with
facts and issues of today,
not yesterday. This point
would seem to be superflu-
ous.
3-It is the party of na-
tional unity, not of mutual-
ly antagonistic groups.
4-It is a party that be-
lieves that things are done
"soonest" when left to "the
energies of free; creative,
individual people."
5-It is completely dedi-
cated to peace for all time
through (a) great national
strength, moral, economic
and military; (b) collective
security, not by a "mono-
lithic" solidarity of alli-
ances but through the free
choice of many nations ded-
icated to a common obje-
ctive, and (c) more and more
efforts to create friendly
exchanges culturally and
otherwise with the peoples
under Communist rule.
There is nothing in these
principles or in the Presi-
dent's amplifications of
them that cannot be agreed
to by Republicans who in
past years were of diver-
gent views as were, say,
Sen. Dirksen and Thomas
E. Dewey. They are the
cement with which a truly
great leader has joined to-
gether all elements of his
party.
*
The theme that runs
through the first, second,
and fourth points, as the
President elaborated them
is that in domestic affairs,
it is better to preserve in-
violate a free economy by
placing reliance upon the
individual decisions of free
men than to rush the fum-
bling hand of the Federal
government into every
problem that arises. It is a
repudiation of the F. D. R.
slogan of "action, and ac-
tion now."
The President illustrates
this principle in the field
of agriculture by pointing
out that in the long run,
by patient encouragement
of self-help, farmers will
be better off than by en-
couraging surpluses with
subsidies.
In labor relations, free
collective bargaining has
been better than the hasty
intervention of the Federal
government.
*
In the management of
the business cycle it is bet-
ter to permit natural ad-
justments than to rush into
crash spending programs
whenever a cloud appears
in the business sky.
Altogether, the President
is saying that the best gov-
ernment is one which is
very sparing in its use of
power and also that local
governments must be en-
couraged to solve problems
for themselves.
This certainly is a defi-
nite alternative to the spir-
it shown by the Democratic
platform and speeches in
Chicago. It is conservatism
in the best sense of that
much-abused word. And it
is dynamic because it re-
flects the releasing of the
great strength of a free
economy, unrestricted by
the paralyzing hand of gov-
ernment.
