AN ISSUE
TO AVOID
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It might be well, before
ill-informed orators in the
current campaign sound off
on the Suez issue, for the
Presidential and Vice-
Presidential candidates on
both tickets to declare the
subject out of bounds.
Such an agreement
might follow the pattern of
an agreement during the
1944 Presidential cam-
paign by Candidate Dewey
after a call from Gen.
Marshall, who was sent by
President Roosevelt. For it
would be easy to talk about
"imperialism" or "dollar di-
plomacy" while Secretary
Dulles is engaged in the
toughest series of negotia-
tions in his career.

Only last spring there
was very inflammatory talk
in the Senate about the
administration's concern
for the interests of Ameri-
can oil companies in the
Middle East â€” talk which
might well provide ammu-
nition for the next tin-pot
nationalist who chooses to
seize property and tear up
a solemn contract.
If the Egyptian govern-
ment is triumphant in this
effort there will be strong
forces in other Arab states
to do some nationalizing on
their own account.
The great issue in the
Suez affair is not the na-
tionalizing of the property
of the Suez Canal Co. with
or without fair compensa-
tion. It is the violation of
the international conven-
tion of 1888, in which the
parties were Great Britain,
Germany, Austria, Hun-
gary, Spain, France, Italy,
the Netherlands, Russia
and Turkey respecting "the
free use of the Suez mari-
time canal."

*

The agreements involved
are to run until 1968. They
have been unilaterally
broken by President Nas-
ser, apparently as an act
of retaliation against the
western powers and to en-
hance what he calls "the
grandeur of Egypt."
Secretary Dulles has
stated the distinction be-
tween the actions of Nas-
ser and an ordinary act of
nationalizing property, al-
though not so forcefully as
has Foreign Secretary Sel-
wyn Lloyd. An act of na-
tionalization comes under
the heading of taking prop-
erty for a public use, and
under our Constitution and
laws just compensation is
required. But in the Suez
case, an international con-
tract is involved which
was validated by a conven-
tion among nine nations.

American and other oil
companies with holdings
and concessions under con-
tracts with Arab countries
in the Middle East are pro-
foundly concerned over
this crisis not so much be-
cause their access to their
markets through the canal
may be blocked, but be-
cause if Egypt is permitted
to flout its contract with
the Suez Canal Co., their
own status will be jeopard-
ized. This is not a matter
of worry for those com-
panies alone, but a concern
for all the nations of West-
ern Europe and for the
United States, for once the
domination of the Soviets
is achieved over that oil,
the entire continent of
Europe and possibly Brit-
ain itself will be at the
mercy of Communism.

It is well known that
Secretary Hull, who was a
deep believer in the fact
that without universal re-
spect for the contracts of
governments there could
be no tolerable interna-
tional community, was
greatly disturbed when the
Mexican government na-
tionalized the holdings of
American oil companies
down there. The fact that
Hull was overruled in that
instance is one of the seeds
from which this bitter har-
vest in Egypt has grown.
If the United States once
more acquiesces in such a
violation of private rights,
the future of American pri-
vate aid abroad will be
gravely impaired. For no
company will be justified in
investing the capital of its
stockholders in the face of
weakness at home and
rapacity abroad.
This is a question which
should be far above and be-
yond partisanship.
