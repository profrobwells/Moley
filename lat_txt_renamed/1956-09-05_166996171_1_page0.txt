UNION TARGET: CONGRESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the course of the recent sessions of the AFL-CIO executive council Jack Kroll, co-boss of the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education, admitted that so far none of the national candidates "had aroused the great interest of the voters." This means the voters in whom Kroll and his committee are interested. Other people in and around the meeting commented that the interest among labor people in the campaign is less than it was in 1952.
It is no secret that George Meany was cold to the idea of an endorsement of either candidate for President, but since a majority of the council preferred Stevenson he would go along. Meany limited the participation of the COPE in the conventions to the appearance of a representative at the hearings on the platforms. Leaders like Reuther and others were there as delegates of the parties or strictly on their own.
The vote of the council on endorsing Stevenson was 14 to 8 on the first show of hands, with Meany and Secretary-Treasurer Schnitzler not voting. In that show of preferences it was noticeable that CIO union heads were for endorsing Stevenson, with a few AFL leaders helping out. Notable figures in the AFL like Dave Beck and Maurice Hutchinson were for neutrality even after Petrillo and two others switched to the majority on the second vote.
The attitude of Meany may be determined by a number of considerations. The first is that Stevenson elicits no enthusiasm, despite his earnest but awkward efforts to be homey and colloquial. Moreover, what there was new about him has long since been worn away.
Another motive that concerns Meany is that the deep attachment that Reuther has already made with the Democratic Party would, if the Democratic liaison with the unions became a legitimate marriage, give the Michigan man greater influence in the party than any other labor leader.
There also is a measure of the old Gompers tradition in Meany, which would keep labor footloose and capable of swinging close elections, especially in Congressional and local contests. Perhaps expediency is a major factor, for while Meany declines to predict the result of the election, he must see that the odds favor Eisenhower, and his position with the administration, if the Republican ticket wins, would be much stronger in all the negotiations that inevitably arise between labor and government.
However, there is nothing lukewarm about the AFL-CIO president's interest in winning a sympathetic Congress. The list of approved candidates for the House and Senate will be overwhelmingly Democratic. There will be a few Republican candidates for the House who will be endorsed but, according to Kroll, not a single Republican Senator. The full force of the COPE drive will not be felt until October, but its impact then will be terrific.
There is more money for the COPE than all the unions have ever spent in politics before. There are literally thousands of potential political precinct workers among union officials and shop stewards. The little "how to win" book of instructions to those workers is a masterpiece of practical political wisdom. There is also a compilation of voting records of members of Congress, prepared by the research staff of COPE at a cost of $50,000, which will be used in the Congressional campaigns, and an appropriation of twice that sum for the salaries and traveling expenses of COPE officials in the next two months.
It may well be that this will prove to be the most terrific drive by a minority in the history of American politics, and that Republicans, now so complacent about the certainty that President Eisenhower will even spare them the trouble of going to the polls, will awaken on the day after the election to the grim prospect of a Congress completely dominated by the AFL-CIO. In that event, it is by no means certain that the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket will not go down in the general rout.
