NO ECONOMY IN ELECTION YEAR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the bulk of American
taxpayers could realize
what this election is really
costing them, they would
be inclined either to
abolish elections or to
elect a President and
Congress that would take
power out of the hands of
the "gimme" groups and
the cowardly politicians
who bow to their de-
mands.
We are now told that
the cost of the Federal
government in the fiscal
year which is now two
months old will be
1 billion dollars more than
the President estimated it
would be last January.
To soften the blow, we are
told at the same time that
revenues will be higher
by $1,300,000,000. So we
shall have a relatively
small surplus. That proud
claim of budget-balancing
is supposed to make us
happy.
But the Treasury leaves
it to us to fill in the bad
news. The plain fact is
that because we are having
an election Congress and
to a degree the adminis-
tration have been tossing
money out to pressure
groups and money which
might have been used to
reduce our taxes or to pay
a part of the national debt.
The taxpayer is like the
man who, after he had a
needs of people who voted
for the bill.
This great increase over
the estimates is only in
small part for defense.
The defense appropria-
tions are only $453,000,000
over the President's Janu-
ary estimates. Most of the
additional spending,
amounting to $2,400,-
000,000, will be for the
farm programs. The post
office service will cost
$378,000,000 more because
Congress would not in-
crease postal rates in an
election year. Housing
will take $200,000,000
more, welfare another
$181,000,000, and increases
in benefits for the huge
bureaucracy $220,000,000.
Thus, something for
nearly everyone except the
taxpayer.
And speaking of the
bureaucracy, what ever
became of the promises in
1952 that this huge bur-
den would be reduced?
Sen. Harry Byrd, that
indefatigable friend of the
taxpayer, has just issued,
through his joint commit-
tee on reduction of non-
essential Federal expenses,
an 11 years' reckoning of
civilian employment. It
will give no comfort to any
taxpayer to learn that ex-
penditures for the civilian
payroll were the highest of
all. It exceeds even the
bloated bureaucratic bill
which came out of the war
in 1946. It was more by
10% than that of Tru-
man's last full year, 1952.
The promise to cut this
great bureaucracy, so far
as cost is concerned, was
not kept. So far as num-
bers of civilian employees
are concerned, the Eisen-
hower administration has
reduced the Truman year
of 1952 by only 1%.
â˜…
This failure to make
good on a promise, how-
ever, will have no part in
the campaign. That is for
the simple reason that one
never mentions rope in
the house of a man who
was hanged. The present
promises of the Demo-
cratic platform and candi-
date would add hundreds
of millions of dollars to the
payroll, and a hundred
thousand or more bureau-
crats.
The taxpayers' choice,
therefore, is limited. Per-
haps he will have to find
some other reason for his
choice. Certainly, there is
no reasonable candidate
running this year.
