THE MAINE
LESSON
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

For a long time I have
been writing in these ar-
ticles that there is no such
thing as a "majority" party,
and that the result of any
given election depends to
a large degree upon the ca-
pacity of an organization to
get out the vote. I happen
to believe that the way a
vote is gotten out is mostly
through house-to-house
canvassing and partly
through the personality of
the candidate.

However, a number of
commentators and politi-
cians, who, while tolerant
of the President, are bitter-
ly anti-Republican, have
consistently contended that
the Democratic Party is
really a majority party and
that only through Demo-
cratic votes was Eisenhower
elected. Walter Lipp-
mann is the most distin-
guished member of that
group whose case rests up-
on a false premise. In a re-
cent article Mr. Lippmann
contended that the Maine
election proves that "the
Democrats are the majority
party."

If Mr. Lippmann would
use addition instead of cogi-
tation to arrive at political
opinions, he would find that
the sum of the votes of the
three Republicans running
for Congress in Maine was
approximately 9000 greater
than the sum of the votes
of their Democratic oppo-
nents.

Mr. Lippmann contends
that the President was
wrong when he said that
the election in Maine de-
pended upon a personality.
There were, however, 41,-
000 voters who favored a
Republican for Congress
and Muskie for Governor.

Therefore, if Mr. Lipp-
mann had been consistent,
he would have perceived
that, if his contention was
correct that President Ei-
senhower was elected de-
spite the fact that he was
on the Republican ticket,
then Muskie was elected
despite the fact that he was
on the Democratic ticket.
But such consistency would
have overturned his whole
case.

Now let us see what real-
ly happened in Maine.
Denis Blais, top CIO man in
Lewiston, was quoted in
the Boston Herald some-
time before the election as
saying, "We are going
down the line for Muskie
and for Coffin (the success-
ful Democratic candidate
for Congress) in the 2nd
District. Our strength is
in the 2nd District but we
expect to be felt also in the
1st District."

Blais and his people did
a terrific job. Victor Riesel,
a commentator who gets
his facts straight, reports
that in Lewiston alone
(where Blais has his head-
quarters) there were 100
union men and their wives
on the telephone continu-
ously for three days before
the election. They made
24,000 calls. On election
day there were 100 auto-
mobiles working to get
people to the polls in the
whole textile district.

The result is illustrated
by what happened in An-
droscoggin County, where
Lewiston is located. In
1952 the vote for both can-
didates for Congress was
24,567. The Republicans had
a majority of 1340. The
vote was less than 50%
of the eligibles.

In 1956 the total vote for
both candidates for Con-
gress rose to 31,087, and
the Democratic candidate
got 1900 more than the
Democratic candidate re-
ceived in 1952. But the
Republican candidate fell
off 3051. This additional
Democratic votes were un-
doubtedly gotten out by
the labor of the union's
organization. Meanwhile,
with a completely inept and
ineffective Republican or-
ganization, great numbers
of Republicans simply
stayed home.

That kind of thing that
happened in Maine can be
repeated in many, many
congressional districts in
November and it can de-
feat the Eisenhower tick-
et, but it will not prove
that the Democratic Party
is a majority party. It will
simply prove that with the
aid of the political arms
of the AFL-CIO the Demo-
crats are getting the larg-
est percentage of their
vote to the polls.

(McGraw-Hill: $2.75), a book
admirably illustrated by
Campbell Grant, who is also
fearless when it comes to
women. Now we should
pause briefly while the
thousands of Armour fans
rush down to their book
stores for their copies. Only
the remaining unfortunates
need to be convinced.

Despite the title, Prof.
Armour, the Toynbee of
femininity, is forced to
start his account with a
man named Adam, "whose
knowledge of women, if not
profound, was at least un-
precedented." After all, un-
til Eve arrived this was a
man's world, sex was at a
low ebb "and it was hard to
get up a conversation about

"It was amazing what a
difference it made when
just one more sex was
added," Prof. Armour tells
us, which is the under-
statement of the century.
Eve was a bad apple. She
was too darned attractive,
she got involved with an
apple and a snake and they
were evicted from the Gar-
den of Eden. As they
walked from the place, car-
rying little more than a
change of big leaves, Eve
said to Adam: "But, dear,
we still have each other!"
Adam, thinking about
the good old days, said
nothing.

Now where else, in what
other tome, can you get
this kind of eyewitness ac-
count? I suspect Prof. Ar-
mour may have been there.
Maybe he was the snake.
The latter interpretation
has been suggested by
some female historians at
Vassar.

This includes keyhole stud-
ies of Delilah, Helen of
Troy, Cleopatra, Lady Go-
diva, Lucrezia Borgia,
Queen Elizabeth, Mme. De
Pompadour, Marie Antoi-
nette, Catherine the Great
(everything they said about
her was true), Josephine,
Queen Victoria, Mata Hari
and a babe called Epilogue
(whom he lists in the table
of contents, but he never
says a word about what
Eppi did or even when she
lived).

But in all the other cases
you get material here com-
pletely unheard of else-
where:

Delilah was deceitful,
yes, but she had pretty
good reason to be. Samson
once hugged her and broke
three of her ribs.

Lady Godiva was an ex-
hibitionist; the only reason
she went on her ride was to
get her picture in the An-
glo-Saxon Chronicle.

Lucrezia Borgia suffered
primarily from unpleasant
relatives and Queen Eliza-
beth, who "insisted on be-
ing regarded as both a
Virgin Queen and the Moth-
er of Her People," proved
to a long line of men that
it is not wise to be blunt
with a woman who has an
ax to grind.

Mme. De Pompadour had
a political party named in
honor of her memorable
shapeâ€”thus Popular Front.
Well, enough of the
scandal. If you want to
know the rest you'll have
to join the boudoir tour by
buying or at least borrow-
ing the book. You might
recognize some of the
dames you've known.
