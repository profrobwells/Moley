'... WHAT PHANTOMS WE PURSUE'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Edmund Burke, in a
moment of depression, ex-
claimed, "What phantoms
we are and what phantoms
we pursue." This has oc-
curred to me over and
over as I have heard and
read what politicians are
saying about what they
have the conceit to call is-
sues.
Vice-President Nixon
steals a march on Walter
Reuther by coming out
for a four-day week. Reu-
ther, who intended to un-
fold this idea later, bites
his fingernails and asks
how it is to be done.
*
And so the great prin-
ciple is agreed upon by
both parties, that work is
a scourge like insanity,
disease or war.
Ultimately we shall,
they say, be free from care
and toil. Then we shall, ac-
cording to the politicians,
have three television sets
in every home. How hor-
rible!
But Stevenson has dis-
covered that people do not
want idleness. Only one in
eight, he says, wants to
quit work to enjoy leisure.
So he is going to provide
work for us as long as we
can get about. Later in
life, when the dread age of
65 is approaching, we are
going to be seized by a
bureaucrat and taught a
new trade. That certainly
is no promise of a happy
old age.
Stevenson notes some-
thing in this connection
which is undeniable. He
says that men and women
between 45 and 65 who
seek employment find the
prospects very dark in-
deed. He fails to add that
it has been the many
forms of what is called
security by pensions and
other fringe benefits that
have caused this problem.
For so long as the employ-
ment of older workers im-
poses an economic bur-
den, preference will be
given to younger people.
An economic law is oper-
ating in this which no gov-
ernment can overcome.
But why bother about
this chatter? Nothing any
politician or any govern-
ment can do will provide
either leisure or work.
These are phantom issues
to fill up the time between
now and election.
The real determination
of what will happen is be-
ing made now in the pre-
cincts, up and down the
streets in the cities, and
out among the farms by po-
litical workers who make
personal contact with vot-
ers. The efficiency with
which that job is done will
determine the result.
The time is rapidly grow-
ing near when registrations
in the various States will
be closed. Then the battle
will be to get the registered
voters to the polls on elec-
tion day.

As I have indicated in
previous articles, that vital
job is being done by the
AFL-CIO Committee on
Political Education with
consummate skill. Only in a
few cities is there any-
thing like that organized
effort in behalf of Repub-
lican candidates.
As I have witnessed the
apathy of Republicans and
the general weakness of
Republican organizations,
from New York to Seattle,
the result may be not only
an enlarged Democratic
majority in both houses of
Congress but a vital minor-
ity completely indebted to
COPE, and dedicated to its
objectives.
In the general defeat of
Republican Congressmen,
it may well be that the Ei-
senhower-Nixon ticket will
also go down.
