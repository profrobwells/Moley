One of the melancholy
experiences of anyone who
has devoted himself dur-
ing his adult life to the
study of politics is to find
himself every four years
living in a country in
which everyone conceives
himself to be an inspired
political expert. In no other
civilized country do people
talk so much and do so lit-
tle about politics.

But to utter that obser-
vation, true as it is, is no
way to dismiss the sub-
ject. For even the experi-
enced political observer
cannot afford to close his
ears to what the public is
saying. The search for re-
liable political principles
is an endless quest. No one
can pretend to be expert
in this complex art.

There are a number of
observations which might
be made at this point in
the campaign which, while
lacking the finality of
scientific principles, I have
found to be serviceable
guides in past campaigns:

1-It is well to hear in
mind always that by the
time an opinion is crystal-
lized in the dinner-table
conversation of so-called
smart people, especially in
the gossip prevalent in
Wall Street (and to a de-
gree in the actions of the
stock market), the facts
upon which that opinion
is based may have radical-
ly changed.

The facts of life are much
quicker than the capacity
of the mind to form an
opinion from them. Just
when people are talking
about a "trend" for this
or that candidate, the ac-
tual situation may have
changed entirely.

2-In fact, it is danger-
ous to talk about "national
trends" at all. American
political life has little uni-
ty. It is a mosaic of many
States, each of which
within itself is split into
localities and even parts of
communities. There are
many hundreds of trends,
crisscrossing and cancel-
ing out one another. Some
general facts and condi-
tions are common to all, it
is true, such as the per-
sonal popularity of a can-
didate or a condition of
peace rather than war, or
a depression. But the ef-
fect of these varies widely
in accordance with local
trends and conditions.

3-It is always well to
avoid putting too much
confidence in so-called "is-
sues." There must be "is-
sues," of course, otherwise
there would be nothing for
candidates to talk about.
And candidates must talk
in order to show them-
selves to the public. But
what is going on, such as
a drive for registration, is
more important than what
is being said.

The insubstantial charac-
ter of "issues" is shown by
the fact that candidates
and parties are never very
certain about which issues
are of most value. Their
use is largely a matter of
trial and error.

4-The old notion that
minor candidates, notably
candidates for the House of
Representatives in a Presi-
dential campaign, ride on
the coattails of the man at
the head of the ticket must
be radically reappraised
this year.

A new, organized force,
the AFL-CIO Committee on
Political Education (COPE)
is concentrating its atten-
tion on a few selected dis-
tricts in favor of or against
specific candidates and, like
labor's political arms in
1948, is not working active-
ly for either Presidential
candidate: In the districts
in which COPE is operat-
ing--about 50 in all--the
coattail rule will certainly
not apply this year.

5-It is almost always
the rule that the candidate
who is ahead in July will
win the election. The elec-
tion of 1948 was clearly an
exception to that rule. It
is asserted that 1896 and
1940 were exceptions. But
is is purely a matter of
speculative opinion that
Bryan in 1896 or Willkie
in 1940 would have won in
July.

I offer these observations
not as dogmatic principles
but as items I have learned
after fairly lengthy experi-
ence in and around the
political scene.
