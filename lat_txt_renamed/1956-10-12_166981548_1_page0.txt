THE NEW
JUSTICE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since the appointment
of Hugo Black to the Su-
preme Court in 1937 there
have been only two selec-
tions which escaped polit-
ical overtones. Those were
President Truman's ap-
pointment of Sen. Harold
Burton of Ohio and Presi-
dent Eisenhower's selec-
tion of John Marshall Har-
lan.
Most of the other selec-
tions reeked with politics.
In the cases of Black,
Jackson, Douglas, Frank-
furter, Murphy and Rut-
ledge, President Roosevelt
wanted people who would
vote the New Deal ideol-
ogy and thus sustain what-
ever he had been able to
jam through an obedient
Congress. In all those
cases experience in the
practice of law or on the
bench was conspicuously
dismissed as unimportant.
Black and Murphy were
for a short time criminal
court judges in their cities.
Douglas, Rutledge and
Frankfurter were pure
academicians. Jackson had
considerable experience at
the bar but no judicial
training.

Cronyism prevailed in
Truman years. Vinson,
Minton and Clark came to
glory that way.
It was natural, there-
fore, when the Brennan ap-
pointment was announced
to search for a political
motive. That seemed at
first blush to be obvious.
Brennan is a Roman Cath-
olic, and since a political
campaign is under way and
since no member of that
faith is now on the court,
his religion was inter-
preted to be his major
qualification.
But further information
about the appointee
brought out other qualifi-
cations. It appeared that a
Republican Governor of
New Jersey appointed
Brennan first to the State
Superior Court and later
elevated him to the State
Supreme Court.
According to a White
House announcement, the
decisive element in Presi-
dent Eisenhower's decision
was a letter recommending
Brennan from Chief Justice
Arthur T. Vanderbilt of
New Jersey.
That sort of endorsement
should be sufficient in any
case, for the New Jersey
Supreme Court is a very
special State tribunal, and
Chief Justice Vanderbilt is
a very special individual.
Several years ago Van-
derbilt was active in creat-
ing a new constitution for
New Jersey and in that
document a court system
was set up which was at
the time unique in the
United States. That system
took account of the fact
that a system of courts is
not just an unconnected
lot of tribunals but an ad-
ministrative organization
with the Supreme Court at
the top.

It was quite natural that
the Governor should place
at the head of the court
the chief architect of the
system. Under the leader-
ship of Chief Justice Van-
derbilt the system of jus-
tice in New Jersey has
gone through an evolution-
ary change, with efficient
organization and simplified
rules of procedure.
In these labors, which
went far beyond the mere
hearing and judging of law-
suits, Justice Brennan ably
assisted Vanderbilt. Indeed,
one of the major points
mentioned by Vanderbilt is
that Brennan will bring to
the U.S. Supreme Court ad-
ministrative capacity as
well as a fine judicial tem-
perament and knowledge of
the law. Moreover, so far
as Brennan's essential con-
servatism is concerned, it
is enough to note that in
almost every decision in-
volving a matter of ide-
ology he has voted with
Vanderbilt.

When the Warren ap-
pointment was made, the
name of Chief Justice Van-
derbilt was at the top of
the list of those under con-
sideration until the last mo-
ment. At that time the
President mistakenly got
the impression that Van-
derbilt was 68 years of age.
This disqualified him and
Warren got the job. In fact,
at that time in 1953, Van-
derbilt was 65.
Now, however, at 68
Vanderbilt can have the
consolation that his junior
colleague, recommended by
him, has attained a post
from which he himself was
harred because nobody in
the White House took the
trouble to consult Who's
Who in America.
