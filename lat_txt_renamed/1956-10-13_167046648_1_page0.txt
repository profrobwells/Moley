RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Meaning Behind
New Voting Figures
Political seers, party
workers, and others interested in the election will
find material of value in
some estimates just issued by the U.S. Census
Bureau. These cover the
estimated civilian population of voting age for
1952 and 1956 in each of
the States and the District
of Columbia. The figures
also show the number and
percentage of the population of voting age who actually
participated in the
election in 1952.
The old deplorable news
is projected by these figures, that a very large number
of Americans do not
make use of their right to
vote. In 1952 there was a
record turn-out, but only
62.7% of those qualified by
age voted. To put it another way, 37.3%, or 36,-
603,603 of those of voting
age failed to appear at the
polls. But while these figures have been customarily
used to measure the
civic and political delinquency of Americans, they
should be materially qualified.
It will be noted that the
Census Bureau gives us the
number of persons "of voting age." It has never, for
reasons which will be obvious, made a firm estimate
of voters actually eligible.
There are many factors
other than age which disqualify people from voting,
and some of those people
cannot be exactly enumerated. There are aliens, estimated this year at 2,500,-
000. There are persons of
voting age in correctional
or mental institutions, estimated at 1,750,000. There
are nonvoting residents of
the District of Columbia.
There are people in poll-
tax States who have not
qualified. And there are
those who have lost their
right to vote because of
lack of residence requirements.
A qualified man in the
government in Washington, who does not want to
be identified, estimates all
of these ineligibles at 5,-
000,000.
The estimated number of
civilians of voting age is
given by the Census Bureau at 102,743,000. To that
should be added 2,100,000
who are of voting age in the
armed forces. That makes
a total of 104,843,000. From
that we subtract the estimated 5,000,000 ineligibles,
which gives us 99,843,000
who could vote if they wish
and are not ill this year.
*
Now let us see about
actual voting in 1952. By
approximately the same
method of computation as
I have used for 1956, the
number who were eligible
in 1952 was found to be
approximately 93,466,000.
In 1952 61,552,000 or 66%
voted. The nonvoters
were 31,914,000, or approximately 34%.
However, a very large
percentage of the non-
voters were in the 11
Southern States of Texas,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee,
Georgia, Florida,
South Carolina, North
Carolina and Virginia. In
those States the presence
of a one-party system and
of many poll-tax ineligibles
made for an abnormal
number of stay-at-homes.
Let us see, therefore,
what happened in the
other 37 States. Here I
shall have to do some estimating of my own, which
I shall be happy to have
any of my readers correct.
*
In those 37 States in
1952 there were 75,568,000
civilians of voting age.
That was 77% of all American civilians of voting
age. To those 75,568,000
I have added 77% of the
military personnel of voting age and subtracted
3,800,000 for nonvoting inhabitants of the District
of Columbia, inmates of institutions, and residential
disqualifications, which
leaves an estimated 73,-
385,000 really qualified
voters in the 37 States.
In those 37 States approximately 53,000,000 voted. That was about 72.2%
of the eligibles.
This percentage is much
better than the estimates
that various commentators
have been offering to the
public as a measure of our
American failure to vote.
With some embarrassment
I admit that I have been
one of those guilty people.
That 72.2% is far from
being good enough. But
it is not so far from the
76% of eligibles in Britain
who voted in 1955. It is
not good, however, in comparison with the 84% who
voted in Britain in 1950 or
the 81.2% in 1951.
It may well be better
than the record which will
be established next month
here in the United States.
