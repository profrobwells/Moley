The least of the criticisms that can be leveled at Paul Hoffman's magazine article about how the Republican Party was saved from a fate worse than death is that it is a political indiscretion of major proportions.

Considering a publication lag common to magazines of large circulation, this article, entitled "How Ike Saved the Republican Party," was released for publication sometime late in September when the fortunes of the Republican Party, including the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket, were at a low ebb.

The President and Chairman Hall of the Republican National Committee were planning more active, indeed desperate measures to unite all party workers to meet the twofold challenge of the Stevenson-Ke-

fauver Democratic Party plus the powerful aid of its auxiliary, the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education. The President's physical capacities were to be called upon for much more strenuous efforts than had been originally contemplated. In big States like Pennsylvania, Republican prospects were very dark.

At that moment when party unity was of the essence, this man, with rather dubious qualifications to be called a Republican at all, launched an article which could not, be more perfectly designed to chill the ardor of party workers in several crucial States.

Included in the list of Republicans whom Hoffman presumes to proscribe as inimical to the President's program and personality are the chairman of the Senatorial Campaign Committee, Andrew Schoeppel, together with five other members of the Senate who wield decisive power in their States. So let us call it a matter of deplorable political judgment.

Perhaps Hoffman would assert that political considerations mean nothing in the high thin air in which he lives and moves, that this attack upon Republicans represents courage which disregards what his enemies might do or say. But in this instance he himself has nothing to lose. He is taking risks at the President's expense. He is gambling with stakes that are not his own.

Far beyond this matter of bad political judgment is an arrant assumption that Hoffman alone may commercialize the inmost emotions and aspirations of the President of the United States, whose intimate friendship he so blatantly claims. The article reeks with superlatives in describing the President's

ideasâ€”"his strongest conviction," "intense personal interest," "deep feeling," "great emotional conviction," "angriest I have ever seen him in the past 10 years," etc.

When, in another administration, Stanley High, who had helped President Franklin D. Roosevelt with some speeches, wrote in a magazine article about the President's ideas concerning some members of his party, the White House summarily repudiated the article and erased the offender from the inner circle.

Certainly the President is entitled to speak for himself in such intimate matters.

Another item that should condemn this outbreak of Hoffman is the fact that he is at the moment in an official position as a delegate to the United Nations. When Stassen started out gunning for the Vice-President he at least had the taste, or discretion, or what not to get an official leave of absence.

Finally, there is revealed in the article itself a grave confession that while he was the head of the largest tax-exempt fund in the world, the Ford Foundation, Hoffman was deep in politics, working like a beaver from 1950 on to bring about the nomination of Gen. Eisenhower. Only well along in 1952 did Hoffman get a four-month leave to participate in politics. Since a philanthropic trust might well, and indeed, should be denied its tax exemption for such political scrounging, Hoffman was hardly living up to his obligations to his employer.

In recent speeches the President seems to have learned how to deal with his political enemies. It seems that he still must learn how to cope with his friends.
