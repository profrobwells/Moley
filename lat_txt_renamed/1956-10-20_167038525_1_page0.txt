Sen. Estes Kefauver,
whose function in this
campaign seems to be
chief scourge of Vice-Presi-
dent Nixon, may be the
only candidate who has
something to gain, no mat-
ter how the election goes.
it Eisennower wins
there will be an end to
Stevenson's aspirations.
But Kefauver, who has on
numerous occasions shown
his lack of confidence in
his current ticket, may
well emerge as a leading
aspirant for the nomina-
tion in 1960. And judging
from his capacity in the
past to survive defeat, he
may well be a factor in his
party's plans for that year.
If, on the other hand,
Stevenson wins the Presi-
dency, the new Vice-Presi-
dent will, no doubt, be
his roving ambassador and
busybody extraordinary.
It may be well for vot-
ers, therefore, to look
carefully to the qualifica-
tions and record of this
man who aspires to the
Nixon post.
*
It. must be emphasized
that, despite Kefauver's
method of campaigning,
he is an individual serious-
ly to be reckoned with.
His discourse is no mere
maundering of an un-
tutored yokel. He may act
and speak like a mere dem-
agogue. But he is a moun-
tebank by choice and a
rabble-rouser by convic-
tion.
No one in the Senate
has been afforded the
benefits of a better educa-
tion, and no man in public
life has a more easily de-
fined philosophy of govern-
ment. The trouble is that
his philosophy is funda-
mentally a bad one, quite
alien to our traditions and
perilous to our independ-
ent position in the world.
Let us review some of
the positions he has taken
in his Congressional ca-
reer. Unlike his opponent,
Vice-President Nixon, he
did not take time out for
military service, although
he was a relatively young
and vigorous man. His
votes, had a majority
agreed with him, however,
would have tragically
weakened our powers in-
ternally and externally.
On the opening day of
the 79th Congress, while
the war in Europe and Asia
was in a most critical state,
he voted against making
the Un-American Activi-
ties Committee a perma-
nent committee in the
House. Had his view pre-
vailed, there would have
been no such committee,
and Richard Nixon would
never have been able to
unmask Alger Hiss.
In 1946 the House adopt-
ed a resolution to cite the
officers of the joint Anti-
Fascist Refugee Commit-
tee for contempt of Con-
gress. Kefauver failed to
recognize the true nature
of that group and voted
with the 50 members in
opposition. Later, the judg-
ment of the majority on
this occasion was amply
confirmed.

In 1946 the House adopt-
ed HR Resolution 430
which authorized an inves-
tigation of the Amerasia
case. Kefauver voted
against the motion. In that
case 1700 documents stol-
en from the files of the gov-
ernment were found in the
possession of that infamous
magazine.
In 1947 the House consid-
ered the Federal employees
loyalty bill to provide for
an investigation of the loy-
alty to the United States of
Federal employees and ap-
plicants for Federal posi-
tions by the Civil Service
Commission and the FBI.
In the debate on this bill
Kefauver's voice was raised
in protest. Despite his pro-
test, 337 members voted to
take up the bill, and at the
conclusion of debate Ke-
fauver moved to recommit.
His motion was rejected,
and the bill was passed
with his vote cast in oppo-
sition.
Later, in 1950, when he
had risen to the Senate,
the internal security bill
was before that body. The
bill provided for a Subver-
sive Activities Control
Board. It was passed, and
later the Senate passed it
over Truman's veto. Ke-
fauver was one of the 10
who voted to sustain the
veto.
In another article I shall
offer further evidence of
the strange Kefauver phi-
losophy of government.
