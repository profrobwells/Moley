WHAT 'INTRANSIGENTS'
FAIL TO GRASP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

They call themselves
conservatives, but they re-
fuse to conserve. Their en-
emies call, them reaction-
ary, but they cannot tell
you what they want to re-
turn to. Historically and
etymologically, the name
"intransigent" applies.
They are people who refuse
to come to terms with re-
ality.

They are telling us that
there is no real choice be-
tween Stevenson and Ei-
senhower this year, that
the President proposes a
program identical with
that of the Democrats and
that he has uncritically ac-
cepted the reforms of the
New Deal.

I have noted in the past
that if Democrats say some-
thing with sufficient fre-
quency, many Republicans
will adopt it as their own.
Democrats had lost elec-
tions and a Democratic ad-
ministration was embar-
rassed by Alger Hiss be-
cause of the activity of
Richard Nixon. Conse-
quently, many Republicans
found a spokesman in Har-
old Stassen.

So it is with a claim
made by Adlai Stevenson:
"I say, in all soberness,
that nearly every govern-
mental program in our
time in our generation
which has helped citizens
meet the problems of their
daily lives more effectively
has been a Democratic
program."

The intransigent accepts
this claim of parentage.
In so doing, he denies
the reality of history. Re-
forms such as were adopted
in the early years of Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt were not
the invention of any po-
litical party. Nor were
those which marked the
first term of Woodrow
Wilson or the administra-
tion of Theodore Roosevelt.
They came in the course of
meeting the needs and de-
mands of human beings.
They were, if you will, in-
evitable steps in progress.

I can speak with some
personal knowledge of
some of the reforms, for in
the early New Deal I was
at the center of things.
Stevenson was a speck in
the misty periphery. My
space here permits only a
specification of three ex-
amples.

The reciprocal trade pro-
gram was proclaimed by
James G. Blaine in the Har-
rison administration, reit-
erated by William McKin-
ley just before his tragic
death, ignored by T. R. for
eight years, and revived by
Taft, who intended to make
trade treaties with many
nations after a beginning
with Canada. His plans
were frustrated by a speech
by Democrat Champ Clark
which alarmed Canadians.

As a means of avoiding
a Congressional revision of
tariffs and to appease free
traders like Cordell Hull,
F. D. R. revived the issue
and secured legislative
sanction for it.

One of the intransigent
school has recently con-
temptuously referred to the
Reconstruction Finance
Corp. as thoroughly bad. It
was, of course, originated
by President Hoover, and
under Hoover's appointee,
Jesse Jones, proved to be
the chief instrument of re-
covery under F. D. R.

Another matter which
would be cited by the in-
transigents would certain-
ly be the management of
credit and money so promi-
nent under F. D. R. This
had its origins in the be-
ginnings of a Federal Re-
serve System. In 1908 a
monetary commission un-
der Republican Sen.
Aldrich began studies
which were later carried on
by a House subcommittee
headed by Democratic Sen.
Carter Glass.

During the Wilson ad-
ministration compromises
were achieved, out of which
came the Federal Reserve
System. Under the Roose-
velt New Deal money man-
agement became a basic in-
strument. To what step
would the intransigent re-
turn?

What the intransigent re-
fuses to see or to admit is
that, while the Eisenhower
administration has accept-
ed certain reforms as es-
tablished national policies,
it has insisted upon a
change in direction.

The President, following
the advice of Secretary
George Humphrey, refused
in the mild recession of
1954 to be stampeded by
Harold Stassen and many
Democrats into a "crash"
spending program. He put
his faith in the natural
forces of investment and
private spending when
backed by confidence in the
value of the dollar. He end-
ed the use of inflation as
an instrument of national
policy.

He stemmed the flow of
Federal money into Feder-
al power projects in the
Northwest and, against the
outcries of the Federal col-
lectivists, insisted on part-
nership with local public
and private bodies. He
stood firmly behind his
Secretary of Agriculture in
opposing the demands of
collectivists' farm policies.
His belief in the integrity
and ability of businessmen
in public service is attested
by the screams of his op-
ponents on the subject.

Surely we would all dis-
agree on details. But our
decision in an election
should be based upon the
tone and direction of a
President's policies. It
would be nice to have a
candidate for every voter.
But that would be imprac-
tical to say the least. How-
ever, that is a fact that the
intransigent fails to grasp.
