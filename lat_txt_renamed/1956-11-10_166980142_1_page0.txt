RAYMOND MOLEY:
Lesson of the Election
for the GOP's Future
After the flush of victory
has subsided and the hard
business of life is resumed,
Republican leaders will
have to face a very serious
problem. At the heart of
that problem is the fact of
the contrast between the
Eisenhower sweep and the
tight race for control of
Congress.
That fact will be dis-
missed by many people,
most of whom hate the Re-
publican Party while they
admire the President, with
the comment that the
President is stronger than
his party. Some will go so
far as to say that Eisen-
hower is not really a Re-
publican at all, but a "na-
tional President," above
and detached from all
partisan considerations.
*
The first of these con-
clusions is not only an
oversimplification, but it
is based upon a fundamen-
tal fallacy. That fallacy is
that party membership is
static, that voters are per-
manently members of one
party or another, and that
there are many more who
are Democratic than Re-
publican,
The fact is that, while
there are some millions
who are dyed-in-the-wool
partisans, there are many
millions of voters with
shifting allegiances or no
allegiance at all. There is
also a constant stream of
new eligible voters whose
allegiance is not yet de-
termined.
The cliche expert covers
all these—people of shift-
ing allegiances, people of
no allegiance, those who,
until the election of 1952,
never voted at all, and
young people who have
not made up their minds—
with the generalized term
"independent." If we are
to preserve for the word
"independent" the moral
connotation that it has al-
ways had, it can accurately
be applied to only a few of
those people. The rest of
them constitute a shifting,
mobile market for what-
ever effort an organization
makes—first, to get them to
vote, and then to vote for
a specific candidate.
Elections, therefore,
especially elections of
members of Congress, are
won by the capacity of a
party's organization to get
out, first, its own regular
membership and, second,
as many as possible of the
unattached who are gen-
erally sympathetic with the
point of view of the party
or the candidate. The
legally constituted party is
able to do the first of these
jobs fairly well, but almost
always fails in the second.
That is where auxiliaries
come in, working with but
not a part of the legally
constituted party. The
Democratic Party in recent
elections has had such aux-
iliaries, notably the politi-
cal arms of labor now con-
centrated in the Commit-
tee on Political Education.
The Republicans have no
such help. The Citizens
for Eisenhower group was
formed to work for Eisen-
hower alone. In this cam-
paign that has been its spe-
cial task, although it has
given considerable atten-
tion to some candidates for
Congress.

What is needed by the
Republican Party is a num-
ber of local groups in im-
portant urban communities
to work 12 months a year
in co-operation with the
party to provide support
for Republican members of
Congress at home while
those members are away in
Washington performing
their duties. Each of such
auxiliaries might well em-
ploy a professional organ-
izer on a full-time basis.
A hundred districts now
marginal, a considerable
number of which are rep-
resented by Democrats, or-
ganized in this way might
well provide the edge
needed for Republican con-
trol of the House. Those
districts in which a very
large percentage of the
urban vote is located might
also swing the election for
a future Republican Presi-
dential candidate.
