REPORTS OF DEMISE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It seems strange to hear,
after the election last week,
that the Republican Party
is about to expire. An
editor in Oregon, reeling
under the shock of the Republican debacle in that
State, went so far as to say
that we would never again
see the election of a Republican President. The reports of the death of the
GOP, however, are, to cite
Mark Twain's comment
concerning reports of his
denise, "greatly exaggerated."

Before we consign the
country to the Democratic
Party, let us examine that
"party." Is it really a party
in anything except in name
and in the exaggerated
generalities of those who
speak for it?

What are the characteristics of a party? First an
identifiable set of principles and policies. Second,
leaders who have authority
which is recognized within
the party. Third, a hard
core of identifiable members.

The Stevenson-Kefauver
formula as spread into the
record, in speeches, and in
the Stevenson essays of a
"New America" is a
warmed-up and somewhat
elaborated version of the
Federal welfare state promulgated by F. D. R. and
later opposed by a stunning
majority. If ever a man had
a mandate, President Eisenhower has one now.
And it is not a mandate
for a Federal welfare state.

As we come to leaders
who are recognized as such,
we must first dismiss from
consideration the defeated
candidates. They are well
on the way to political
oblivion. So far as the two
Congressional leaders are
concerned, Sen. Johnson
and Speaker Rayburn, they
have been rejected by their
own State. In Texas their
party leadership is already
challenged by the Shivers
faction which supported
President Eisenhower in
his sweep of the State.

In New York State Gov.
Harriman has a somewhat
impaired hold on the badly
beaten Democratic organization. Unless some miracle man appears among
the newly elected Democratic Governors and
Senators, the Democratic
Party must go on with its
already shopworn leaders.

The party membership is
well divided. The big city
machines did badly in this
election. The old reliance
on ethnic groups and the
prejudices therein has been
shaken. The Negro vote refused to be managed this
year. There was also confusion among the nationalistic groups because of European events. Even the
union memberships, despite
the efforts of Committee on
Political Education, were
shaken and divided.

Many Democrats in the
South, who have never had
any kinship with the urban,
boss-controlled Democrats
of the North or with the
labor groups, left their traditional moorings in large
numbers to vote for the
President.

The percentages of the
vote which went to Eisenhower-Nixon in the States
carried by Stevenson
ranged from 49.4 in Missouri to 30.7 in Mississippi,
and the average in all seven
States was 41.1. This suggests a rapid approach of
a two-party system in all
the South. After many
years, the South is escaping from its captivity in a
Democratic Party which
has come to be controlled
by northern liberals.

The difficulties which
will be encouraged by
Democratic leaders in Congress will soon be apparent. Johnson and Rayburn,
like Queen Elizabeth, will
reign but not govern.

There is plenty that
needs to be said about why
the Republican Party, despite its enormously popular candidate, failed to
carry Congress. In another
article I hope to throw some
light upon that.
