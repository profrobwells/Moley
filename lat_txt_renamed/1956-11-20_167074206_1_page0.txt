ARKANSAS
REPORT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
LITTLE ROCK—In Ar-
kansas, as in other States
in the South, the question
of future party alignments
is widely discussed. Among
Democratic officeholders
the idea of a real growth of
a Republican Party is dis-
counted.
They say that the vote
for President Eisenhower
was entirely personal and
that, except in a few ‘dis-
tricts in Florida, Virginia,
and Texas, there will be no
break in the Democratic
representation in Congress.
They say also that the elec-
tion of a Republican Sen-
ator in the South is un-
thinkable, even though the
prospect in Texas may look
that way to some people.
These views, of course,
reflect the immediate in-
terests of members of Con-
gress, who have their com-
mittee chairmanships and
seniorities to consider. Sen.
McClellan of this State
would, of course, regard it
as nothing less than a trag-
edy to be serving again
under the chairmanship of
Sen. McCarthy.

But there are others, who
are looking into a more
distant future and see
realistically the implications
of clinging to the
Democratic Party. Arkan-
sas, for example, is rapidly
becoming an industrial
State. Its major cities, hum-
ming with new businesses,
voted decisively for Presi-
dent Eisenhower. Not only
are Republican business-
men from the North mov-
ing in, but those leaders
in business who have
grown up here have been
voting against Democratic
candidates for President
for a long time.
They realize that as in-
dustry grows unionism will
grow likewise, and that the
political arms of labor will
be operating with more
and more money and man-
power. It is quite probable
that the AFL-CIO Commit-
tee on Political Education
will move into and take
over Democratic organiza-
tions in many sections.
This will be easy, because
the Democratic organiza-
tions in many of these
States are only skeletons.
★
Candidates run on their
own and, in the case of
Senators and Representa-
tives, the Federal jobs they
have gotten for followers
provide them with person-
al machines. As political
labor grows, the successors
to the present members of
Congress will lean more
and more to the left. When
that happens, conserva-
tives will have nowhere to
go except to the Republican
Party.
One man said to me that
it was the intention of con-
servative Democrats to
cling to their party affilia-
tion because they might be
able to maintain Demo-
cratic State parties for local
and Congressional pur-
poses. Then they could
throw their weight around
in national conventions,
and, if the candidates se-
lected there were not suit-
able, throw their States to
the Republicans in Presi-
dential elections.

The answer to him was
that such purely State
parties would have less
and less to say about the se-
lection of candidates for
President and Vice-Presi-
dent. They were flouted
even as far back as 1940 in
the selection of Wallace,
and in 1944, when Truman
had to pass the muster of
Sidney Hillman and other
northern labor leaders.
Alben Barkley made it
clear in 1952 that the
labor bosses had a veto. In
1956 the South had very
little to do about the selec-
tion of the ticket.
Thus the idea of semide-
tached Democratic parties
offers a grim and unpromis-
ing future for conserva-
tives. That future will have
no attraction for young
men and women coming up
in the world. It is from
these young people that the
leadership of a Republican
Party in the South must
come. They will see quite
realistically that the racial
issue will be supplanted in
time by economic differ-
ences. They will renounce
the past and seize the fu-
ture.
