RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Campaign Report
Weighed and Checked
In a report in "Editor two sources of information
were divided. I did not
check Louisiana and missed
it completely. But it is im-
portant to note that the
people I consulted in the
cases of certain States
about which I sought fur-
ther information - West
Virginia, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Oklahoma-
were exactly right on the
Monday before the event.
and Publisher" concerning
the annual session of the
Associated Press Manag-
ing Editors Association,
since the election, it is said
that members present com-
mended spot news of the
election by AP but com-
plained that grass-roots
surveys were too early and
too inaccurate. Altogether,
the report summed up the
feeling that there was "un-
inspired reporting of an
uninspiring campaign."
Nothing much can be
done about making sure
that a campaign will be in-
spiring. There are circum-
stances that determine
that, which neither the
parties nor the candidates
can govern. But a great
deal can be done about re-
porting. And it should be
added that the newspapers
need not take all the blame.
The same criticism and
many others can be leveled
at the magazines, tele-
vision, and radio.

One editor said that
grass-roots surveys were
made too early. He added
that "surveys should be
begun 10 days before elec-
tion and continued up to
the week end before it."
This, it seems to me, is a
valid point. In fact, if such
day-to-day predictions were
anywhere near accurate,
the reporters who make
them would learn a very
important fact. They would
realize that if a candidate
is running well, his rate of
gain will be steeply pro-
gressive. It mounts at a
terrifying rate during the
last week end before elec-
tion. I have found that the
best time to make a test is
on the Monday before the
election.
In my own case, I made
a fairly complete check 10
days before election and
made a private estimate for
myself alone, giving Presi-
dent Eisenhower 37 States
and 425 electoral votes. On
the Monday before elec-
tion I checked the doubt-
ful States by telephone and
there had been several
shifts among the key peo-
ple whom I consulted (they
were political reporters and
politicians), so that my
final estimate was 39 States
certain for the President,
with Texas on the line.
In the case of Texas my

The 50 Washington cor-
respondents who were con-
sulted by Newsweek about
10 days before the election
averaged 347 electoral votes
for the President. This is
hardly an enlightening esti-
mate, even so far away
from the election.
But there are two crit-
icisms of campaign report-
ing much more basic than
this question of the accu-
racy of predictions. The
press, it seems to me, has a
much more important func-
tion to perform than mere
prophecy (especially since
it is apparent that the Gods
of prophecy are made of
tin). It is to inform and en-
lighten readers concerning
the issues under discussion
and, what is just as impor-
tant, the forces at work in
the campaign.
A few commentators who
are privileged to write
under by-lines contented
themselves not with an ex-
pression of their own views
or even with a reporting of
the views of qualified ob-
servers. They went into the
byways and reported what
a butcher on 3rd Ave.
or a taxi driver in Ottum-
wa felt about things.

This is a complete sur-
render of editorial responsi-
bility, although the stuff
makes light and occasional-
ly interesting reading. It
is inaccurate, however, in
that a few such interviews
translated into a headline
are most misleading. It
leaves altogether too much
leeway for the reporter or
commentator to hide be-
hind his informants by a
process of selection and of
distortion of the views he
gets. If this sort of hodge-
podge of voices from the
multitude is the "new"
journalism, then the editors
indeed have a lot to worry
about and answer for.
