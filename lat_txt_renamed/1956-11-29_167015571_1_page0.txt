ADDING UP THE BILLS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If I were a cartoonist, I
would portray a poor little
figure of a man fumbling
with a great pile of papers,
all marked "please remit."
He would be the taxpayer,
and the bills he must meet
are the promises sown by
candidates in the recent
campaign. The sum total
of these bills is staggering,
even to a taxpayer who has
been staggered many
times before.
Somebody has estimated
that the election cost the
two parties more than
$100,000,000. I should not
be surprised if the amount
ran far in excess of that.
But that expenditure elicits
no emotional disturbance
from me. The people who
contributed to that expen-
diture were willing vic-
tims. They were men and
women of means, accus-
tomed to shell out for the
party of their choice, or
they were people from the
usual sucker list-contrac-
tors and others who seek
favor from the government
-or people who want Am-
bassadorships or other
posts, or people who
bought tickets to $100 din-
ners, or they were mem-
bers of unions whose dues
were used by labor bosses
to drive from public life
Congressmen who will not
toe the mark.
★
The actual cost to the
parties and labor auxili-
aries, while setting new
records in amounts, is
chicken feed compared
with what taxpayers must
meet in fulfilling the prom-
ises made to pressure
groups by candidates, even
such high-minded lovers of
economy as Dwight D. Ei-
senhower and Richard
Nixon.
We can forget the lavish
plans of Adlai Stevenson
for a "new America." He
lost, and therefore his
plans for more spending
are no longer important.
But Republican promises
are very much alive and
constitute an urgent first
order of business. They
would, if enacted, consti-
tute an increase in spend-
ing, for nonmilitary and
nonforeign aid purposes, of
such proportions as would
foreclose any hope of sub-
stantial tax cuts for the
next two years at least.

Another factor needs to
be kept in mind. In the
first two years of the Ei-
senhower administration
the House of Representa-
tives was responsible for
cutting the President's
budget estimates in a very
marked degree. Thus, the
House, once considered to
be the extravagant branch
of government, exceeded
the President and the Sen-
ate in its zeal for economy.
We shall not be able to
look for any such support
for economy in the next
two years. For the inroads
of labor's political machine
on the membership in 1954
and 1956, together with the
revolt of farmers, were
spending and inflationary
influences. They captured
a considerable number of
House seats formerly held
by economy-minded Re-
publicans and cut the ma-
jorities of several others
so much that the election
of 1958 will be an ever-
present threat.
★
But the cost of the 1956
election in terms of addi-
tions to spending programs
in the 84th Congress has
already been great. Dr.
Harley L. Lutz, former
Princeton professor of fi-
nance, in an analysis of the
1957 budget made these
significant points:
"1-More than half of the
budget reductions made in
the years 1953 to 1955 will
have been lost by the end
of the fiscal year 1957, after
adjusting all figures to a
comparable basis with 1957.
"2-The spending in 1956
and 1957 has moved up-
ward with the improve-
ment in revenue results
and prospects.
★
"3-Budget balance in
1956 and 1957 has not been
the result of expenditure
control, but of revenue in-
creases in excess of antici-
pated yield."
Only the President can
check the rush of the "gim-
me" groups now. Only the
President can face the fu-
ture with no fear of future
elections. But he has prom-
ises to keep not only to the
burdened taxpayer but to
pressure group minorities.
We shall see which will be
uppermost in his mind.
