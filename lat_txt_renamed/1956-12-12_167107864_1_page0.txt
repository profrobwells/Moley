WHO DID
NOT VOTE?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

There is no question
about the deplorable fail-
ure of Americans to neglect
their moral obligation to
cast their vote at elections.
In many cases, however,
the record is based upon
statistics which deserve a
second look. For it is not
the mere ratio between
the number of Americans
of voting age and the num-
ber of votes cast that meas-
ures our deficiency. There
are many factors which are
legitimate barriers against
voting.

The American Heritage
Foundation, which has
done admirable work not
only this year but in 1952
in getting people to the
polls, has released a num-
ber of sobering qualifica-
tions on the common as-
sumption that only about
half of our qualified voters
appear at the polls.
The Census Bureau this
year estimated that 104,-
843,000 people are of vot-
ing age, including 2,100,000
in the armed forces.

But from that number
some important groups
must be subtracted. Ac-
cording to the American
Heritage figures, among
the people of voting age
who find it legally impos-
sible to vote there are
6,000,000 who are unable
to meet residence require-
ments because of moving,
2,500,000 aliens, 800,000 il-
literates, 500,000 residents
of the District of Columbia
who do not have absentee
voting status elsewhere,
160,000 prisoners and per-
sons on probation and pa-
role, and 2200 excluded in
Utah because of a factor in
the Constitution there.
This is a total of 9,968,200.
There are also a large
number who would find it
extremely difficult to vote
and for the most part do
not vote. These are 5,000,-
000 sick people in institu-
tions and at home, 2,600,000
people kept from the polls
because of travel at regis-
tration or election time, and
115,000 preachers of Jeho-
vah's Witnesses who have a
religious prohibition. The
total of these is 7,715,000.
Thus, according to these
figures, there are 87,159,-
000 who have no reason
other than their own indo-
lence or indifference for
failing to vote.

In the recent election,
according to the latest fig-
ures, 60,496,000 voted.
That means that 69% of
those eligible and able
voted.
This compares with
much higher percentages
in the last three British
elections: 84% in 1950,
81.2%, 1951, and 76%, 1955.
But our comparable rec-
ord is actually better.
The greatest area of ab-
stention is in the 11 South-
ern States.

In 1952, 77% of the eli-
gibles, so far as age was
concerned, were in the 37
States outside of the so-
called Solid South. Apply-
ing that percentage to the
1956 Census Bureau esti-
mate, there were 80,729,-
000 of voting age outside
the Solid South. Subtract-
ing from that number the
percentage who, according
to the American Heritage
Foundation, found it diffi-
cult or impossible to vote,
we have 65,390,000 who
could and should have vot-
ed with no great difficulty.
As of Nov. 13, there
were 60,496,000 votes for
the two major candidates.
According to the figures
for 1952, 87% of the vote
was cast in the 37 States
outside the Solid South.
Therefore, we can estimate
about 87% of the total this
year, or 52,635,000, in
those 37 States.

The answer is that 80%
of those who were eligible
appeared at the polls in
the 37 States.
States.
If, and there is consid-
erable "if" involved, the
British figures were calcu-
lated on a comparative
basis, we did about as well
as they did in those 37
States.
That margin of 20% non-
voting remains, however.
There is also the tremen-
dous problem of making it
easier for those who found
it difficult to vote to cast
some sort of absentee bal-
lot.
The conclusion is ines-
capable that it is altogether
too difficult for Ameri-
cans to participate in the
choice of the government
under which they must
live.
