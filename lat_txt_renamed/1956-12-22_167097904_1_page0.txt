RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Vice-President
Is Proving His Value
Perhaps because every-
one is willing to let last
summer's uprising by Har-
old Stassen against the
candidacy of Richard Nix-
on rest with other unpleas-
ant memories, no one ap-
parently has applied the
test of fact to the poll
which was cited to prove
the danger of renominating
the Vice-President. It was,
as I remember, a prediction
that Nixon would cost
President Eisenhower 10%
of his vote.
*
According to the Associ-
ated Press President Eisen-
hower received, in round
numbers, 35,575,000 votes.
According to the Stassen
poll this would constitute
90% of what he would have
received if Nixon had been
dropped. Therefore he lost
3,053,000 anti-Nixon votes.
If we add this to the num-
ber that he did receive, the
President's vote, according
to Stassen's "scientific"
polling apparatus, would
have been 39,528,000. Ste-
venson, who presumably
received the anti-Nixon
votes, would be diminished
to a paltry 22,080,000. The
President would then have
had a plurality of 17,448,-
000. He would have car-
ried all the States except
Alabama, Georgia, Missis-
sippi and South Carolina.
*
Aside from showing how
fallible all such calculations
as Stassen's prove to be in
predicting the outcome of a
given set of circumstances,
these figures are of value
only in the field of amuse-
ment. The important thing
to note is that despite the
gloomy and vindictive com-
ments last winter, spring
and summer about Nixon
and the concentration of
fire on him during the cam-
paign, the Vice-President
is now proving himself of
inestimable value for the
President and the nation.
They were never based
upon much except vague
assertions that he was a
wicked campaigner and an
untrustworthy statesman.
There were also the fears
of the opposition party that
Nixon would be, as he had
been in the past, a most ef-
fective campaigner.
But another motive
prompted opposition to
Nixon. This was a perfect-
ly sincere belief among
Republicans on the "inter-
nationalist" East Coast that
Nixon as heir apparent
would represent not the
mildly internationalist po-
sition of the President but
the so-called "isolationist"
Republicans west of the
Hudson River.
The answer to that fear
is already in the record.
Nixon, largely because he
was regarded as leaning
away from the "interna-
tionalists," has the confi-
dence of the Taft-Hoover
Republicans far beyond
any other official who is
close to the President. It
is therefore in his power to
unite the party in the fate-
ful international decisions
that lie before us. More-
over his position as a mem-
ber of the legislative branch
of the government enables
him to bridge the gap that
has existed between the
midwestern and western
Senators and the Presi-
dent.
*
In another respect his
value to the Republican
Party and to the President
is very great. Nixon thor-
oughly understands the
meaning and value of grass-
roots party organization.
The military man who oc-
cupies the White House
has learned a lot but not
enough. And never was
the Republican Party
more in need of fundamen-
tal repairs than it is nowâ€”
paradoxically after its
greatest Presidential vic-
tory in many years.
So far as a "new" Repub-
licanism is concerned, it is
precinct and county organ-
ization that the party
needs, not a new ideology.
It will be Nixon who will
supply the impulse neces-
sary to that sort of recon-
struction.
It is idle to speculate
about Presidential candi-
dates in 1960. Nixon may
or may not achieve that
goal. But his claim will be
very important if he proves
to be the instrument
through which both unity
and efficiency can be at-
tained for his party.
