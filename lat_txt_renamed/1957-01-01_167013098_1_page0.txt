'ASSIMILATION, NOT ELIMINATION'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A bitter internal fight
among New York State Re-
publicans is under way
over the office of Attorney
General which is to be va-
cated by Sen.-Elect Jacob
Javits. The office is very
important not only because
it is rich in patronage but
because it might well be the
steppingstone to the Gov-
ernorship — and who
knows? — to the White
House.
Javits is holding the job
and will not be sworn in
as Senator until after the
New York Legislature is in
session. This is to make it
possible for the Legislature
to select his successor. Oth-
erwise, the rich plum would
fall to Democratic Gov.
Harriman.

It seems quite clear at
the moment that Dewey's
man is Supreme Court Jus-
tice David W. Peck, who
has been a protege of the
former Governor since his
appointment to the court
several years ago. There is
a strong faction in the Re-
publican Party in New
York, however, which is
not friendly to Dewey and
which feels that the ex-Gov-
ernor is wielding too much
influence in the State or-
ganization since his retire-
ment. In effect, these anti-
Dewey people feel that they
are now entitled to carve
their own political fortunes
after many years of serving
the Presidential ambitions
of the twice-defeated candi-
date.
Republican leaders met
just before Christmas to se-
lect a successor to Javits
but failed to agree. Another
meeting will be held short-
ly after New Year's.

In order to put Justice
Peck on display the Dewey
people made him a speaker
at an organization dinner
shortly before the meeting
of the leaders. In the course
of his remarks, which were
full of generalities about
the new Republicanism,"
he said that "we" must "get
rid of the Dirksens, the
Jenners and the Welkers"
so that bright, fresh, young
people can be gotten into
the party.
It is a bit difficult to fol-
low the justice's reasoning
here. If there can be no
new, fresh people gotten
into the party before the
old leaders are put out, a
vacuum is suggested. Who
is going to do the putting
out? In the case of Dirksen
several hundred thousand
Republicans have just fin-
ished putting him back in
the Senate. Jenner may be
unpopular in New York
but he is not likely to be
upset in Indiana. Welker
was defeated with a sug-
gestion that plenty of New
York money was bestowed
in the process.
It was this sort of criti-
cism of the Republican
Party that lost Dewey
many friends over the
country and which prob-
ably greatly contributed to
the apathy which carried
him to defeat in 1948.
I would suggest to Jus-
tice Peck and also to for-
mer Gov. Dewey two bits
of wisdom from the careers
of two truly great politi-
cians. In 1932 there ap-
peared in the first draft of
Roosevelt's acceptance
speech a passage which
welcomed "progressive Re-
publicans" into his crusade
and that at the time invit-
ed "reactionary" Demo-
crats to leave. When the
speech was shown to Sam-
uel Rosenman, a seasoned
politician, he told Roose-
velt that he approved of in-
viting people in but strong-
ly advised against inviting
people out. Roosevelt
agreed.
Also years ago Will
Hays, when chairman of
the Republican National
Committee, coined an ex-
pression which should be
a guide to every practical
politician. He said, "Poli-
tics is assimilation, not
elimination,"
The Republican Party is
not so much in need of a
new program as a rebuilt
organization at the pre-
cinct level. And nowhere
is it needed more than in
New York.
