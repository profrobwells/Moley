Insomnia has its uses.
In the middle of the night,
pondering the mystery of
Sen. Bill Knowland's an-
nounced retirement next
year from the Senate, there
came to mind the opening
lines of a famous story by
Ernest Hemingway:
"Kilimanjaro is a snow-
covered mountain 19,710
feet high and it is said to
be the highest mountain in
Africa. Close to the
western summit there is
the dried and frozen car-
cass of a leopard. No one
has explained what a leo-
pard was seeking at that
altitude."
Knowland is one of those
high, lonesome mountains
where explorers climb
with their cleated boots,
but from which rarified
heights no one ever brings
much intimate knowledge
-just mystification and
respect. The mountain-
eers have discovered, how-
ever, unmistakable proof
of political animality near
the summit of Mt. Know-
land. The air seems much
too thin to support political
life. And yet-something
which wears a skin and
walks on feet has traveled
by political instinct to
these chilly peaks. "No
one has explained what a
leopard was seeking at that
altitude."
What is Bill Knowland
after? About a year ago,
before Mr. Eisenhower
had announced that he
would run for re-election,
Knowland was an open
candidate for President.
But his platform, if that's
the name for the cloud he
seemed to be riding, was
one of political resurrec-
tion or revivalism.
All human religion with-
out exception, I think, is
based on faith in rebirth.
But in politics, when you
talk about rebirth, revival,
or "Mine Eyes Have Seen
the Glory," you are labeled
reactionary or impractical,
Knowland does not like the
drift which our public af-
fairs have taken in both
parties toward the welfare
state at home and the world
state abroad. This is an
old-fashioned attitude and
very impractical.
In his lofty, solitary way,
Bill Knowland is a man
whom most people like and
almost nobody knows. He
wears, like many a moun-
tain, a cloak of mist and
a discouraging cold front.
I think Knowland regrets
his remoteness, as if it were
a physical infirmity, but he
knows he is stuck with it.
Without being a close
friend, I have been his
nearly constant admirer,
and I think he knows how
I feel. He has always made
himself accessible to me,
we have had breakfast to-
gether in the Senate dining
room and, blushing furious-
ly, he has thanked me for
something laudatory which
I may have written about
him.
Four days before he an-
nounced his decision not
to seek Senate re-election,
I was told in confidence
about it by an authorized
spokesman on his staff. And
although I had that much
of a jump on the news, I
could find no plausible in-
terpretation of it when it
happened.
But there is a southern
Senator on the Hill who
loves Bill Knowland. He is
voluble and hail-fellow and
as much of an extrovert as
Knowland is an introvert.
This southern Democrat
has given me the only ex-
planation which is worth
repeating.
Everybody in town can
tell you that Knowland is
leaving the Senate (a) to
run for Governor of Cali-
fornia in 1958 and (b) to
run for President in 1960.
There is a lot of political
animality in this version
of the Knowland motives.
If he could win the Gov-
ernorship from Goodwin
Knight, who now holds it,
Knowland would have bet-
tered his present position,
which is No. 2 Californian
behind Vice-President Nix-
on.
Moreover, by rendering
himself a noncandidate for
Senate re-election, Know-
land has a freedom of ac-
tion toward Nixon, whom
he dislikes, and toward
most of the "New" Repub-
lic legislation, which he
finds indistinguishable
from New Dealism. While
there is some question as
to the timing of Know-
land's announcement, the
tactic could readily prove
one of the supersmart
plays of our times.
But the southern Sena-
tor I'm speaking of has a
different theory. He be-
lieves Knowland has played
it supersmart in a way no-
body else seems to guess.
After all, what is Know-
land doing? He is quitting
on top, which hardly any-
body has sense enough to
do. He is entering the
"third house" of legislation,
the press, by taking over
his family newspaper, the
Oakland Tribune.
He is removing himself
from the target range
where the dead cats of
political recrimination fly
by night and day. He is
establishing himself in his
comfortable middle years,
48, as head of a fine busi-
ness and a loving family
and as a rare sort of institu-
tion-the Younger States-
man-which political light-
ning might very well de-
cide to strike.
Mysterious? I know. "No
one has explained what a
leopard was seeking at that
altitude."
Sen. William F. Know-
land is a man not only
marked by great forthright-
ness in speaking his mind
on public affairs but at the
same time an individual
who knows how to keep
his own counsel. He is one
of the best listeners in pub-
lic life.
Consequently, some of
his reasons for his decision
to retire from the Senate
after 1958 must be left to
the conjectures of others.
Some of those conjectures
are patently wrong. Oth-
ers have circumstantial evi-
dence on their side.
It is obvious that he is
entirely truthful in assign-
ing personal reasons for
retiring. But many Wash-
ington correspondents can-
not understand that any-
body would prefer living in
California rather than in
the heat and confusion of
Washington. Perhaps they
have not enjoyed the cli-
mate of California. More-
over, some of them cannot
understand that managing
a very important newspa-
per is an attractive alter-
native even if not located
in Washington or New
York.
They are probably wrong
in assuming that this
means a permanent renun-
ciation of public life by
the Senator-a renuncia-
tion that forecloses all fu-
ture political office. That
assumption flies in the face
of the truism that a pub-
lic man is never the com-
plete master of his destiny.
Time and chance and cir-
cumstances have their
way, notably with a man as
able, as young and as dedi-
cated to the public interest
as is Knowland.
It is true that, so far as
a possible nomination for
the Presidency in 1960 is
concerned, Knowland
would be following the wise
course in retiring from the
Senate.
As leader of his party in
the Senate he suffers many
restrictions. He has never
interpreted his job, as Al-
ben Barkley once expressed
it in connection with his
difference with President
Roosevelt, as "carrying the
Flag" for the White House.
Knowland regards himself
quite properly as responsi-
ble not to the President
but to his party in the Sen-
ate. Nevertheless, he must,
to a degree, guide the
President's program wheth-
er he likes all of it or not.
As a private citizen he
will have no such respon-
sibility. In that capacity he
might well provide for his
party a definition of policy
more in line with Repub-
lican traditions than the
so-called "new" Repub-
licanism that some of the
"middle-of-the-road" advis-
ers of the President prefer.
But speculation about
1960 is quite useless at this
time. Presidential nomina-
tions can rarely be fore-
told until after the mid-
year elections, except in
cases in which a President
is in his first term and is
practically assured of re-
nomination.
A Governor may emerge
after the elections of 1958
who captures the imagina-
tion of the public and is
free from the inevitable
handicaps of a regime in
office.
There is also the possi-
bility that the popularity
of President Eisenhower
may fade. Public favor is a
fragile flower. Who could
have predicted that an ob-
scure Mayor of Buffalo
in 1881 would be nom-
inated and elected Presi-
dent in 1884? Or in 1908
that a college president
would be nominated and
elected in 1912? Or in 1917
a somewhat mediocre Sen-
ator named Harding would
be in the White House four
years after?
Those who are blithely
giving the nomination in
1960 to Vice-President Nix-
on fail to grasp those reali-
ties. The Vice-President is
perilously poised under
the shadow of the Presi-
dent.
This is not to say that
Knowland is planning to
seek the nomination in
1960. Certainly it is not
good sense to assume that
he is going to contest the
Governorship of California
with Goodwin Knight. The
plain truth is that the Re-
publican Party in Califor-
nia cannot afford a pri-
mary fight.
Whatever may be, the
Republican Party and the
nation are fortunate in
having, for whatever fate
may provide, a man of
stature such as Knowland.
