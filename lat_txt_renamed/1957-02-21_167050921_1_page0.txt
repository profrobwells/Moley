A LACK OF CLARITY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The substitute for the
President's requested Mid-
dle East resolution goes a
considerable distance in re-
moving the principal con-
stitutional objection from
the plan. But it still is not
clear about the meaning of
"military assistance pro-
grams."
The wording adopted by
the committees authorizes
the President "to under-
take in the general area of
the Middle East, military
assistance programs."
It then goes on to declare
that "the United States re-
gards as vital to the na-
tional interest and world
peace the preservation of
the independence and in-
tegrity of the nations of
the Middle East. To this
end, if the President de-
termines the necessity
thereof, the United States
is prepared to use armed
forces to assist any nation
or group of nations re-
questing assistance against
armed aggression from any
country controlled by inter-
national Communism: pro-
vided that such employ-
ment shall be consonant
with the treaty obligations
of the United States and
with the Charter of the
United Nations."
*
After the President had
learned of this substitute
for his request for author-
ity to use force at his dis-
cretion, he authorized a
statement to the effect that
he regards the new resolu-
tion as designed to give
him the authority for
which he had asked to use
force, if necessary. This
seriously complicates mat-
ters. Does the expression
"to undertake . . . military
assistance programs" mean
authority to use United
States armed forces in ac-
tion or does it merely
mean the giving to nations
in that area arms and
equipment?
That question seems to
be unanswered. In fact,
Sen. Hubert Humphrey
complicated the matter
still further when he said
after the meeting that "if
the President finds it nec-
essary to take military ac-
tion, we will support what
he does. But the respon-
sibility for the decisions is
squarely up to him."
It is perfectly clear from
an examination of the Sen-
ate debate on the subject
before the resolution was
adopted by the committees
that several Senators were
opposed to giving a blank
check to the President to
use armed force. But the
resolution leaves the whole
matter up in the air. If that
is the best that those com-
mittees of more or less
learned lawmakers can do,
they would be advised to
temper their criticism of
Secretary Dulles.

This confusion, however,
can hardly excuse the
wretched showing that
Dulles made in committee
hearings. Here, for exam-
ple, is a passage between
the Secretary and Sen.
Long:
Sen. Long: Did Presi-
dent Roosevelt have the
right to put troops on Ice-
land during World War II?
Secretary Dulles: I don't
know.
Sen. Long: I am sure
you have given some
thought to the matter.
Secretary Dulles: No, I
have never given thought
to that one.
Sen. Long: In your judg-
ment, did President Jeffer-
son have the right to send
American forces against
the Barbary pirates?
Secretary Dulles: I don't
know, sir.
Sen. Long: In your judg-
ment, did President Tru-
man have any right to send
American forces or any
power to send American
forces into Korea?
*
Secretary Dulles: I nev-
er studied that as a law-
yer.
Sen. Long: Never con-
sidered it?
Secretary Dulles: No,
sir.
Sen. Long then reminded
Dulles that he was in the
State Department at the
outbreak of the Korean
war. In fact, he was en-
gaged in the Far Eastern
business at the time.
Secretary Dulles was
made Secretary of State
because of all American
lawyers he seemed to be
most expert in internation-
al relations and law. His
failure to respond to these
questions is amazing. In-
deed, it quite properly
raises questions about the
quality of our whole for-
eign policy.
