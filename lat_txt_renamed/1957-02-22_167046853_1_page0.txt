SMEAR OF
THE YEAR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Some Congressional com-
mittees actuated by politi-
cal considerations have in
the past made some low
marks in honestly present-
ing the facts, but a special-
ly created Oscar for the
smear of the year should
go to the Subcommittee on
Privileges and Elections in
the 84th Congress.
Sen. Albert Gore was
chairman, and Mike Mans-
field and Carl T. Curtis
were the other members.
Sen. Curtis, it should be
noted, disagreed vigorously
with the report as well as
with the methods followed
in conducting the investi-
gation.
The full report with ex-
hibits is a mighty affairâ€”
nearly as large as the Presi-
dent's budget. Perhaps the
very size of the thing pre-
cluded a careful examina-
tion by some writers who
have commented on it in
magazines and newspapers.
Perhaps they took merely
the summary that it pleased
the majority of the com-
mittee to air to the public.
In any event, the content
of the report, bad as it is,
has been made worse by
sloppy reporting thereon in
at least one magazine and
in two signed columns that
I have seen.

The basic data for the
study were obtained by
collecting information
both from the givers and
the receivers of money for
the campaign. But the pe-
riod upon which the ma-
jor conclusions are based
was only from Sept. 1 to
Nov. 30. By this method
the contributions made to
the two party organiza-
tions appeared very large
while the amounts spent
in money and manpower
by labor organizations
over the entire year are
small.
It is also basically a mis-
representation because
these contributions in-
clude only money spent
for professedly political
purposes. Thus there is
omitted what is spent out
of union funds for what
are called "education and
news dissemination" in
print and on the air waves.
There are various cate-
gories selected in order to
show that a very large per-
centage of the money was
contributed to the Republi-
can Party. While it is clear
from a close reading of the
report that the contribu-
tions were from "individu-
als," it has been easy for
people who choose to
smear corporations and
business associations to say
that "companies" or
"firms" or "associations"
gave the money. This, of
course, is not true.

The aggregate for such a
category as "military prime
contractors," for example,
is made up of contributions
from officers and directors.
The same person and his
contribution can appear in
several categories. One man
and his contribution, for
example, appear in the
"largest military prime
contractors" and "largest
oil companies," the "Ameri-
can Petroleum Institute,"
the "National Manufactur-
ers Association," "12 se-
lected families" and prob-
ably in several other groups
in which individuals are
not specified. Therefore,
the meaning of the statisti-
cal compilations vanishes
in a series of duplications. If
this committee were not
entirely interested in pay
political dirt, it might have
found that this man was a
very large contributor to
many causes of a religious,
philanthropic and civic
nature.

*

One category lists the
contributions to the parties
by 37 leading advertising
agencies. Presumably, as
one commentator has indi-
cated, this is to show that
some of these companies
were interested in getting
business from the parties.
The pay dirt was thin, for
only $51,600 was unearthed.
It is worthy of note that
the subcommittee failed to
mention, in connection
with this item, that the
widow of a man who
headed one of these agen-
cies in his lifetime gave
$64,400 to the Democratic
Party.
One of the most interest-
ing items in the book is the
identity of the largest in-
dividual contributor to
either party. It was Lans-
dell K. Christie. He gave
$70,564 to the Democrats
and $2600 to "miscella-
neous."
