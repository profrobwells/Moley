Labor Power Without Responsibility
Sylvester Petro was born
in 1917 in a steelworkers'
community in Chicago. His
family and early associa-
tions were a part of the
growing labor movement
in the steel industry.
His first job was in "the
Mills." When the CIO, un-
der the protecting wing of
a wholly sympathetic Fed-
eral government, was com-
pleting the organization of
steelworkers, Petro took a
leading part in preaching
and promoting unioniza-
tion in the Republic Steel
Co. plant in Chicago.
After working in several
other plants, he resumed
his formal education and,
with occasional jobs to sup-
port him, finished college
and law school. He is now
a professor of labor rela-
tions at New York Univer-
sity Law School.
His book, just published
by the Ronald Press, "The
Labor Policy of the Free
Society," not only bears
the imprint of wide read-
ing and serious thought
concerning the rights and
responsibilities that are es-
sential in a free society,
but it shows the long, prac-
tical experience of the au-
thor in the labor movement
itself.
In a sense this book re-
views the profoundly dis-
turbing issue before the
American people today:
Whether we can long tol-
erate a condition under
which there is one law for
a labor union and another
for all other forms of vol-
untary association.
Racketeering and blithe
arrogance on the part of
many labor chiefs and un-

ions, Petro shows, are
symptomatic of a deep and
disturbing fault in our sys-
tem of law and its admin-
istration, or, perhaps more
accurately, its lack of ad-
ministration.
In tracing labor-law his-
tory he effectively de-
stroys arguments put by
labor officials to a member-
ship and public they ap-
parently regard as misin-
formed and gullible. "Far
from discriminating
against unions," Petro ex-
plains, "the law has strug-
gled ineffectively — up to
the very present — merely
in the attempt to bring
trade unions within the
juridical structure so that
the same rules could be ap-
plied to them which apply
to all other persons and en-
tities in society."
This failure has made it
possible for unions to
achieve a monopoly status
in the United States, with
compulsion and coercion as
"normal union methods."
Free employee choice, in-
dispensable in a "free" so-
ciety, under laws such as
the Norris-LaGuardia and
Wagner Acts, become a
mockery.
Two important points
are made by the author
which the so-called liberals
should ponder: First, that
the rule of law does not
exist in labor relations,
that a man is entitled there
in only exceptional cases to
a day in court, no matter
how unlawfully he has
been harmed. And further,
that unless the pseudo-
judicial, political body, the
NLRB, and its general
counsel concur in giving
an injured person a hear-
ing, he will get no hearing
anywhere in the Federal
system. This situation is
the result partly of Con-
gressional action and part-
ly of action of the Supreme
Court.
Petro holds that Con-
gress acted unconstitution-
ally when it gave exclusive
power to prosecute and ad-
judicate the rights and
duties established in the
National Labor Relations
Act to the National Labor
Relations Board and its
general counsel.
The Supreme Court has
compounded the chaos. In
its notorious presumption
theory the court held not
only that State courts may
not hand down decisions in
conflict with Federal law
but also that State courts
may not assume jurisdic-
tion over cases involving
parties subject to Federal
power.
Certainly there is no
basis in the supremacy
clause or any other pro-
vision of the Constitution
to support this strange doc-
trine. And the "finding" of
the court of a Congression-
al intent in the Taft-Hart-
ley Act to "occupy a field"
to the exclusion of State
courts is simply not true.
In the interests of the
society we espouse Petro
sees the answer in abolish-
ing the NLRB, among
other things, and returning
to the regular constitu-
tional courts full jurisdic-
tion in all cases arising
under the National Labor
Relations Act. To do so,
says Petro, would not be
experimenting in the great
unknown. "It is not as
though the regular Federal
courts are an unknown
quantity. They have been
handling labor and com-
mercial cases for almost a
century, and their record
over the long years has
been outstanding."
