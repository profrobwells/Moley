NONSENSE
IN KOREA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The foreign aid adminis-
trators are going to have a
hard time when they ap-
pear before the Appropria-
tions Committee of the
Senate asking for funds for
fiscal 1958. They will have
to explain why they have
failed to make allocations
for the current year, to say
nothing of incomplete
planning for next year.
Moreover, they will have
to face one of the most in-
formative, not to say alarm-
ing, reports on their activi-
ties that has yet appeared.
This is the 500-page report
by Sen. Ellender (D) La.,
on his tour of more than
30 countries last year. It
is replete with factual ac-
counts of strange goings-
on with American money
in foreign lands. One of the
most interesting is what
has been happening in
Korea.
In the February issue
of the Reader's Digest
there is the account of a
ridiculous affair in Iran
involving a hydroelectric
dam which was master-
minded by one William E.
Warne. Those familiar with
the efforts of the Interior
Department under Ickes
and Chapman to Socialize
electric power will remem-
ber Warne as a member of
that department who rose
to be assistant secretary.
It seems that with the
coming of the Eisenhower
administration the Socialis-
tic bureaucrats merely
shifted to another place of
government employment.
Until about a year ago the
Korean operation was un-
der a man named C. Tyler
Wood, who was with the
old ECA in the days of the
Marshall Plan. Wood was
shifted to Washington a
year ago and Warne was
moved from Iran to Korea.
Sen. Ellender reports
that the United States has
spent $780,000,000 in Korea
in the last three years.
The number and variety of
operations and projects are
very great. But there is
only space here to deal
with two.
The Koreans are a rice-
raising and rice-eating peo-
ple. But in the infinite
caprice of the International
Co-operation Administra-
tion it was decided to
change the eating habits of
the Koreans so that they
could export rice. So there
were built some flour mills
which, according to Sen.
Ellender, were intended "to
convince the people that
bread is a suitable substi-
tute for rice in their diet."
With his mind on Loui-
siana and Texas, where
rice is grown for export,
the Senator added that if
Korea starts to export rice
it will be competing in the
"Far Eastern markets
which our own rice indus-
try would like to obtain."
But Korea produces no
wheat. Therefore, if the
new flour mills are to oper-
ate, we shall have to give
wheat to the Koreans or
subsidize the importation
of wheat from other coun-
tries.
With reference to our
strange activities in cotton
textiles, Sen. Ellender
points out that we have al-
ready built several textile
mills in Korea, despite the
fact that the country pro-
duces no cotton. This has
been done by the ICA offi-
cials over there on the as-
sumption that Korea will
be able to purchase cotton,
presumably from the
United States under the
Surplus Disposal Act. But,
the Senator adds, this as-
sumption is rash, since the
act may be repealed as soon
as our domestic market
gets itself in balance.
Thus we build hydroelec-
tric plants where there is
oil to burn, flour mills
where there is no wheat
and textile mills where
there is no cotton. This
would seem to be a "for-
ward-looking" policy with
a vengeance.
