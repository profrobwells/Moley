POLITICAL
FUNDS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In a previous article I
commented on the report
of the Senate Subcommit-
tee on Privileges and Elec-
tions which gave in some
detail an account of cam-
paign contributions and ex-
penditures in the 1956 cam-
paign. My conclusion was
that the report, because of
its partisanship and mis-
representations, was a
thoroughly bad document.
But certain facts brought
out therein deserve plenty
of airing and a great deal
of consideration by both
political parties. These
facts have to do with the
old American custom of ap-
pointing big party contrib-
utors to important diplo-
matic posts abroad. This
subject is a touchy one to
handle, but it certainly de-
serves attention and correc-
tion. Perhaps because the
custom is common to both
parties it is not made the
subject of partisan debate.
*
In the report there is a
special category which in-
cludes some, not all, of the
contributions made by
"chiefs of diplomatic mis-
sions abroad" to the Re-
publican Party. No Demo-
crats are listed, although
there are plenty of Demo-
crats who contributed in
1956 who have under Dem-
ocratic administrations
held diplomatic posts
abroad.
Among the outstanding
figures in the list are indi-
viduals who were appoint-
ed by the President as Am-
bassadors to the court of
St. James's, to France and
to Italy.
Winthrop Aldrich is list-
ed as having given $2000
and his wife $1000. It is,
however, a matter of
knowledge that in the pre-
convention campaign in
1952 Aldrich was very ac-
tive in collecting for the
Eisenhower cause.
Our Ambassador to
France under the Eisen-
hower regime was until
recently C. Douglas Dillon.
He and Mrs. Dillon are list-
ed as having contributed
$36,500 to the Republicans
in 1956.
*
It is only fair to say that
there was nothing in the
previous career of Dillon
to merit appointment to
the responsible post of Am-
bassador. Nor was there
much beyond his service
as a president of the Chase
bank to qualify Aldrich.
Mrs. Henry Luce, until
recently Ambassador to
Italy, contributed $30,875 to
the Republicans, and un-
der her contribution ap-
pears the letter "H" and
a contribution of $29,375.
"H" stands for "husband,"
who in another list appears
as Henry R. Luce.
The successor to Aldrich
at the Court of St. James's
is John H. Whitney, list-
ed as having contributed
$32,100. Mrs. John H.
Whitney is down for $15,-
000. There is also an entry
for Whitney's sister, Mrs.
Joan Whitney Payson, for
$65,050. Mr. Charles Pay-
son is down for $6800. Mr.
Whitney also passed the
hat for the Eisenhower-
Nixon ticket.
*
In the early days of the
Roosevelt administration
the appointees to London
and Paris were the late
Robert W. Bingham and
Jesse Straus, respectively,
both of whom "qualified"
with contributions to the
Roosevelt cause. Later
Joseph P. Kennedy suc-
ceeded to the London post.
He was also an early Roo-
sevelt contributor. Later
there was W. A. Harriman,
who was a large contribu-
tor. The list could be ex-
panded indefinitely.
Three points seem to be
justified in connection with
this custom. In the first
place, it is no compliment
to the nations to which peo-
ple are sent when we make
choices on the basis of cam-
paign contributions. In the
second place, these posts
are not just ornamental.
Grave matters of judgment
are involved. In the third
place, it is not necessary
that rich people hold these
jobs. The government now
provides plenty of main-
tenance.
First of all, there should
be a strict limit on the over-
all contributions of every-
one - not as low as Walter
Reuther would have it, but
less, certainly, than the
Whitney and Luce contri-
butions. Then the dignity
of the office should be rec-
ognized by appointment on
the basis of merit.
