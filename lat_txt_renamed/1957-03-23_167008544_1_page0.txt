RAYMOND MOLEY:
Multitude of Aspirants
for Texas Senate Seat
DALLAS-In a winner-
takes-all special election for
the Senate seat vacated by
Gov. Price Daniel-an elec-
tion to be held on April 2
-Texans are embarrassed
by a multitude of candi-
dates. There were no few-
er than 23 until one with-
drew but the remaining
candidates seem deter-
mined to stick to the fin-
ish.
The state of the law
which permits this sort of
scramble is no small source
of embarrassment also to
those who prefer orderly
government. But two re-
medial bills in the current
session of the Legislature
seem doomed to failure.
*
Only six of the 22 aspir-
ants are regarded as seri-
ous. These are Thad Hutch-
eson, a Republican; Searcy
Bracewell, an Eisenhower
Democrat; Martin Dies,
presently Congressman at
large and a Democrat;
Ralph. W. Yarborough, three
times defeated for Gover-
nor and once for Attorney
General; John C. White,
State Commissioner of
Agriculture, and James P.
Hart, former chancellor of
the University of Texas
and former member of the
Texas Supreme Court.
In the ideological spec-
trum the first three of the
above can be classed as
conservative: The remain-
ing three are "liberal."
Good judges of trends
seem to think that the race
has narrowed down to Yar-
borough and Dies. And I
have found more sentiment
for Dies and more people
who believe he will win.

Hutcheson will get many
votes from dedicated Eisen-
hower admirers. A belief
that he would represent the
attitude of the Eisenhower
administration on civil
rights attracts many Negro
voters. He was largely re-
sponsible for the drafting
of the civil rights plank at
the Republican National
Convention at San Francis-
co. He has a name well
known in Texas. His uncle
is a distinguished Federal
judge.
However, conservative
Texans are doubtful about
him not only because they
suspect him of the liberal
slant of the "new" Re-
publicanism but because
they fear that if elected his
presence in the Senate
might make it possible for
the Republicans to reor-
ganize that body and
change the chairmanships
of the committees.
*
This is a special worry
for Sen. Lyndon Johnson,
since his majority leader-
ship would be lost in such
a reorganization. His in-
fluence, which is consider-
able in Texas, may well go
to the best candidate who has
the best chance of winning
over Hutcheson.
The most favored liberal
Democrat has until recent-
ly been Yarborough. There
is plenty of evidence of
labor money and activity
behind him, and his cam-
paigns, although unsuc-
cessful, have made his
name well known through
the State. But certain fac-
tors have turned against
him recently. He will lose
much of the Negro vote.
His two liberal opponents,
White and Hart, will take
from his potential. White
is especially popular among
farmers.
*
Martin Dies, famous in-
vestigator of Communism
in the Roosevelt era, has
many advantages which
are showing up at this
stage of the campaign. He
is better known than any
of the candidates. While he
was out of Congress for
some years, he returned in
1953 as Representative at
Large. He has won easily
since. Moreover, conserva-
tive Democrats and even
some Republicans prefer
his proven experience and
tested conservatism on
public questions to all
other candidates.
Interest in the election is
not notable. Possibly less
than half of the normal
2,000,000 voters will turn
out. This can also be
counted as a Dies ad-
vantage.
