If Msgr. Higgins wants to
interpret that as calling the
board a rubber stamp, I am
willing to waive the differ-
ence. But I would like
Msgr. Higgins to clear up a
number of doubts that are
naturally raised in connec-

Since Msgr. Higgins pre-
sumes to speak for the
board of which he is a
member, I wish he would
express an opinion about
the ethics of using the gen-
eral funds of the union for
purposes called "educa-
tional," but which were
plainly designated by the
Supreme Court in its de-
cision of last month as
really political. Does he re-
gard any ethical question

money contributed as dues
to support candidates
