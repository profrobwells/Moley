NEW. GOP
CHIEF
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The new chairman of the
Republican National Com-
mittee, Meade Alcorn of
Connecticut, no doubt
learned more than anyone
else who attended last
week's conference of mid-
western Republican lead-
ers at Omaha.
For some time the tide
of sentiment among Re-
publicans has been run-
ning strongly against ideas,
expressed shortly after the
election last fall, that the
Republican Party needs a
reorganization, complete
with a "new" program,
new faces, and the purging
of all and sundry Senators
and Congressmen who dis-
agree with the advisers of
the President.
Alcorn, apparently recog-
nizing this tide of opinion,
has repeatedly indicated
that his purpose is to har-
monize, and that, in the
words of a distinguished
predecessor as chairman of
the national committee,
Will Hays, "good politics
consists of assimilation not
elimination."

In several neatly worded
statements Alcorn has dis-
sipated the idea that he in-
tends to disrupt the party
over which he presides. To
the suggestion that cer-
tain members of Congress
be purged, he said more
than a month ago:
"Any Republican who is
nominated through the
regular processes and runs
on the Republican ticket is
entitled to our support."
To the contention that
the Republican Party needs
a new program, he said:
"There is a lot of talk
about modern Republican-
ism. It is easier to describe
than define; (it is) belief
in an adherence to all those
traditional principles which
have made our party great,
but with one important
added ingredientâ€”a sense
of mission:"
This is easy enough to
understand. It means that
Republicans everywhere
need to expend more en-
ergy in getting out the
vote for their candidates.
And no one will deny that
so far as possible when
new candidates are need-
ed, the best possible tim-
ber should be induced to
run for office.

Since the election last
fall there have been innu-
merable magazine articles
and speeches and state-
ments to the effect that the
Republican Party must re-
new itself or die. I have
kept a file of these and have
looked therein without suc-
cess to find exactly what a
"new" program means. For
the most part that idea is
expressed by people who
were never conspicuous for
their Republicanism before
1952. Many of them are
merely pro-Eisenhower,
while they oppose every-
thing connected with the
party. And almost without
exception, when pressed,
these new Republicans ad-
mit that their antipathy is
against personalities. The
list of those whom they
would purge usually con-
tains Sens. McCarthy, Jen-
ner, Malone and, in some
cases, runs on to Goldwa-
ter, Bricker and Dirksen.
An excellent bit of proof
that the matter has been
one of personalities rather
than policies is that Sen.
McCarthy is always put at
the top of the list of those
who are to feel the new
Republican ax. But so far
as his voting record is con-
cerned, the Senator from
Wisconsin has followed the
free spenders and subsidiz-
ers more than any other
Republican Senator except
Langer. He was for rigid
farm supports and for prac-
tically every big public
works handout in the last
two Congresses.

At Omaha, according to
Chairman Alcorn, the Re-
publicans present were
strongly against the big Ei-
senhower budget, against
Federal aid for school con-
struction, and for an end to
foreign economic aid.
Basically, their belief
seemed to be that there is
nothing so "dynamic" as a
free economy in which citi-
zens relieved of heavy tax
burdens can spend their
own money, and that there
is nothing more wholesome
than to let the States and
local governments run their
own affairs. In short, the
Republicans at Omaha
stand where the President
stood in his campaign
speeches in 1952 and 1956.
