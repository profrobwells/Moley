A MARXIAN SQUEEZE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It was, as everyone knows, a cardinal principle of the gospel according to Karl Marx that the middle class must and will be destroyed. Thus, he stressed the importance in that task of a heavy progressive income tax.
We have such a tax in the United States and it seems that the leaders of both parties are going to do something about tax relief. However, if we are to judge what Rayburn and other Democratic leaders are to do by what they have done in the past, the relief, if any, will be directed to the lower-income groups and the method may be the raising of exemptions. It will probably also be assumed that the rates higher up should not be touched, because it is still good politics to soak the rich.
No one seems to be concerned about the real sufferers, who are neither the low brackets nor the very high ones.
The rich can find many ways to soften the blow by the purchase of tax-exempt bonds and by other means. The people in the lower brackets, if they are wage earners and especially if they are members of some of the more fortunate groups, have had compensatory raises in pay and other benefits which have softened not only the impact of taxation but of inflation.
The middle groups, however, lack the advantages of the rich or of the wage earners. High, steeply graduated income taxes, coupled with inflation, have caught them squarely in a squeeze that would have gladdened the heart, if any, of Marx.
Let us assume, for the purpose of illustration, that the cost of living and also all wages and salaries have doubled since the beginning of World War II. The rise in surtax rates, meanwhile, has gone on apace. And while the income of Mr. Middle-Group Man has doubled, his tax bite has increased at a much greater rate. I am indebted to Rene Wormser, whose book, "Personal Estate Planning in a Changing World," has run through many editions, for certain illustrations of the plight of the man in the middle.
Suppose he was a lawyer earning $8000 in 1939. He is now earning $16,000. In 1939 he paid a tax of $1950. He now pays not twice as much individual income tax to the Federal government, but approximately $5200. But it is important to note that, after paying that tax, he would have $10,800 left. In 1939 he would have had $6050 to live on after taxes. Thus he has to live at a lower standard than in 1939. And so, if he were to live at the 1939 standard, he would have to earn $19,000 instead of $16,000.
Let us consider another man, who was earning $16,000 in 1939 and who is now earning $32,000. He would have to earn $44,000 to break even with 1939.
Or, if he were earning $32,000 in 1939, he would have to earn $125,000.
The man who earned $2000 in wages in 1939 would have to earn only a little more than twice as much, or $4200, to be even with the past. But he may also have not only twice the pay but a number of other benefits—sick benefits, pension rights and the like.
Perhaps that is why we hear so often from people in the $8000 to $15,000 range that they are making a lot more but are saving less. We might also add that half of what they saved in 1939 has been stolen by inflation. And according to the President, there are sacred “programs” which are more important than the integrity of those savings and the preservation of the middle income groups. But these groups are singularly lacking in political leadership, and so long as that condition prevails they will continue to feel the Marxian squeeze.
