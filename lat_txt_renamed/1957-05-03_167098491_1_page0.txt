A CREDIT TO THE CABINET
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When the rumored re-
. tirement of Secretary of the
Treasury George Hum-
phrey becomes official, a
fine chapter will have been
written in the history of
public service.
A lawyer by training and
an industrial manager by
choice, Humphrey brought
extraordinary qualifications
to the Treasury. Before
that, he was a man who had
not shirked his civic and
political responsibilities in
Ohio. He made no secret of
his active support of politi-
cal figures like the late Sen.
Taft, nor of his many con-
tributions in time and ener-
gy to the services of his po-
litical party.
As a public official in
Washington he handled his
public relations so well that
in general he has had the
privacy and of the freedom
that goes with a job in man-
agement. In public office a
man must be patient with
bores and nuisances, and,
above all, restrain himself
in expressing opinions on
public questions. What is
most difficult, he must
best "press" of any member | Secretary Humphrey
of the Eisenhower Cabinet.
Moreover, his great influ-
ence with his colleagues
learn to ignore vicious, par-
and with the President has astisan attacks from the oppo-
been used in critical situa-
tions in the interest of mod-
eration and stability.
When, in 1954, there was
a minor lag in business,
some members of the offi-
cial family, especially Har-
old Stassen, were pressing
for a crash program of
spending. It was Hum-
phrey, with Economic Ad-
viser Arthur Burns, who
held the line against hys-
terical action, and the re-
vival of business proved
they were right.
The sacrifice that a busi-
nessman must make when
he takes public office is not,
as some would claim, a
monetary loss. It is the
renunciation of his right to
sition in Congress.
Humphrey has wisely
disdained to comment up-
on a nasty attack in the
present session by. Sens.
Kefauver and Morse. They
conducted an oratorical
lynching bee over the fact
that the Secretary of the
Treasury was the owner of
stock in the company of
which he had been head.
There was nothing specific
proved or even alleged
about the use of influence.
It was just a general view-
ing with alarm.
Morse ran through his tl-
rade, progressing helter-
skelter from Humphrey to
foreign policy, to the Mid-
dle East and the oil compa-
nies. It was a bewildering
profusion of implied vil-
lainy, which he embellished
by saying that the problem
is "one that smells to high
heaven."
The Morse nose was nev-
er offended by businessmen
who, in his first race for the
Senate, supported him gen-
erously. Nor has Morse
smelled anything wrong in
the support he has more re-
cently had from Beck and
his Teamsters Union in Or-
egon. He has, in fact, re-
cently announced that he is
proud of that support.
What businessmen must
realize, if their reluctance
to enter public life is to be
overcome, is that these
demagogues are attacking
them not because they real-
ly believe them to be un-
trustworthy or even be-
cause they believe that the
public approves such at-
tacks.
*
Demagogues make these
attacks because they want
businessmen to stay out of
public life. They want busi-
nessmen to believe they
make poor politicians and
are unsuited to public of-
fice. The tragedy is that
the demagogues have suc-
ceeded to a degree in their
effort because many busi-
nessmen believe that non-
sense.
The consequent loss to
political life and public
service is very great, be-
cause with the size and
cost of government mount-
ing and with its problems
more and more closely en-
twined with economic af-
fairs, there is dire need for
more business in politics
and government. If ever
business experience were
needed in public affairs it is
now.
