Norman Thomas ought
to know something about
Socialism, since he has
been talking about it for
the greater part of his 72
years on earth.
The revolution in Russia
he came to regard as a
wicked perversion of Marx-
ism, but the British Labor
Party has just about fitted
his concept of a perfect
embodiment of his dreams.
What he wants, apparently,
is a Socialistic revolution
by utterly peaceful,
not to say happy, degrees.
It was hard for Thomas
to find anything to say
about the opposition when
he ran five successive times
against Franklin D. Roosevelt
and Harry S. Truman,
since he found so many of
their pet projects, such as
the TVA, the fulfillment of
his beliefs. But nevertheless
he ran and denounced
those Democrats for their
compromises with the evil
power of capitalism.
Now, however, he is, in
the warm twilight of life,
mumbling happy hosannas
at the progress that the
Eisenhower administration
is making toward the
Thomas ideals.
In an excellent college
paper, the Harvard Times-
Republican, an interview
appears with the veteran
Socialist leader in which he
is quoted as saying:
"The United States is
making greater strides toward
Socialism under Eisenhower
than even under Roosevelt...
this progress can be credited
to President Eisenhower and
is particularly significant because
it is being made by a Republican
administration... the President's
budget allocates too much for
military expenditures, but it
is very good for social welfare.
No cuts should be made in
education and welfare expenditures,
although a campaign against waste
should be conducted in all
government spending.
Waste is common to all administrations
and must be fought at all times."
On the same day that the
President was summoning the
League of Women Voters to
give battle for his spending
program, his successor as
president of Columbia University,
Grayson Kirk, was hoisting a
warning signal. He said:
"... We need, as a democratic
people, to protect ourselves
against ourselves. This is the
danger, that we shall so begin
to develop government as an
instrument of welfare that we
lose, in the process, some of
our own stamina, self-reliance
and individual initiative..."
"All life is a struggle and
it is through struggle and
effort that men grow in stature
and capacity, and a government
that seeks to cushion every
economic shock will produce a
society in which men unknowingly
will deprive themselves of the
advantages of growing stature
while they delude themselves
with the promises of an enervating
security.
"And there is another risk,
perhaps equally as great. This
is the effect upon a society of
trying to carry such a heavy
load of social services that the
resulting tax burden frustrates
the accumulation of private capital."
It should be added that when
Dr. Eisenhower was president
not of the United States but
of Columbia University he talked
exactly as Dr. Kirk is talking.
Perhaps it is the Washington
atmosphere that has had an
effect. Or perhaps the perspective
is different when a problem is
looked at from the point of view
of a college president who must
rescue a few dollars from the
people after they have paid their
taxes.
