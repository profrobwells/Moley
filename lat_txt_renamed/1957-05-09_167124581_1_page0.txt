There are two well-worn
devices by which we may
avoid entangling ourselves
in a battle that surrounds
a controversial public figure.
During his lifetime we
may say that we approve of
his aims but disapprove of
his methods. When he dies,
we may say that only history
can make a judgment.
Passing the buck to his-
tory has been a favorite device
with political figures
in Washington who have
commented upon Sen. Jo-
seph McCarthy's death. A
notable instance—and, con-
sidering his own career,
amazing—was Vice-Presi-
dent Nixon.
Perhaps the Vice-Presi-
dent was thinking about
what happened last week
in the body over which he
presides when an earlier
Senator from Wisconsin,
Robert M. La Follette, the
elder, was chosen by a
Senate committee as one
of the two outstanding
Senators of our time.
For the passions that
enveloped La Follette, the
bitterness with which he
was assailed here and
abroad, the snubs and in-
juries that happened to Mc-
Carthy. But time and
events have, after 40 years,
given a generous appraisal.
I suggest an evaluation
of McCarthy based upon a
background of the conditions
against which he contended.
Consider the
lethargy which prevailed
over the face of American
life in the late 1940s concerning
the Communist
menace—an indifference
which was especially pronounced
in the Federal
government. Consider a
Hiss in the State Department,
and a White in the
Treasury, both making high
policy. No one contributed a
greater share in awakening
both the public and the
government to this danger
than McCarthy. It took
violent methods and strong
language to bring about
that awakening.
His warnings about sub-
versives in the State Department,
so heartily denied
at the time he made
them, were later justified
in overflowing measure,
not only in Nixon's own
words, but in the public record.
Nor was McCarthy's concern
about the Army without
foundation, as the
events proved.
In achieving these measures
of success McCarthy
encountered the bitter and
subtle enmity of the twin
bureaucracies of the State
Department and, to a degree,
of the Army. Any
one who has lived close to
those entrenched citadels
of power knows how fiercely
they resist anyone who
attacks them. Their influence
even extends to the
highest levels in the executive
department. And in
his reckless way McCarthy
took on both. The counter-
attack was severe.
Perhaps his violence in
those fights was excessive.
But this must be appraised
in the light of his nature.
He was no man to mince
words. And he had a passionate
loyalty to his
friends and subordinates,
even when they were unworthy.
There is, of course, a
point in politics where discreet
silence is an advantage,
not to say a virtue.
And there is a point where
loyalty ceases to be a virtue.
But there are other
and less pleasant ways to
describe the abandonment
of convictions and of
friends and subordinates.
The matter is in the sphere
of emotion, which is not always
the dwelling place of
perfect wisdom. It was
Franklin D. Roosevelt who
reminded a cheering country
that "Dante tells us
that divine justice weighs
the sins of the cold-blooded
and the sins of the warm-
hearted in different scales."
The measure of achievement
should always be
made in terms of what was
attempted and encountered.
Carlyle in his essay on
Burns made this profound
observation:
"Granted, the ship comes
into harbor with shrouds
and tackle damaged; the
pilot is blameworthy; he
has not been all wise and
all powerful: but to know
how blameworthy, tell us
first whether his voyage
has been round the globe
or only to Ramsgate and
the Isle of Dogs."
