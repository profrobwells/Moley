RIGHT TO
WORK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Several amendments to
the administration's civil
rights program are pre-
pared which would make
freedom from compulsory
unionism coequal with
other civil rights. Sens.
Goldwater and Eastland
have such amendments
ready. And now Sen. Mc-
Clellan has announced one
of his own.

Since his committee-
hearings on management-
labor relations have cap-
tured the attention of the
country, the Arkansas Sen-
ator has great public pres-
tige, and his amendment
on this subject is likely to
have very serious consider-
ation.

For this reason, the zeal-
ous sponsors of civil rights
legislation are genuinely
alarmed. These people, for
the most part, happen to be
ardent defenders of union
activities, and hence any
attempt to pass a Federal
right-to-work law is regard-
ed as most undesirable.

Serious criticism of Sen.
McClellan has already ap-
peared in pro-civil rights
newspapers. The import of
such comment is that the
introduction of this issue
may greatly hamper the
work of the McClellan com-
mittee, since, it is alleged,
its success must depend
upon the co-operation of
the unions.

This is highly doubtful.
For the committee can
make its inquiry with or
without the co-operation of
union leaders. Co-operation
so far has come from anon-
ymous union members who
are captives in closed-shop
contracts. Indeed, there is
grave doubt whether there
would have been an in-
quiry at all if the leaders
could have prevented it.
Most of the evils which
have been uncovered by
the McClellan committee
and a good many others
that it may bring out would
have been impossible ex-
cept for the monopolistic
power of the unions. And a
basic factor in that monop-
oly is compulsory union-
ism. Thus McClellan's spon-
sorship of a Federal law
prohibiting compulsory
union membership is a
quite logical outcome of
the committee's investiga-
tion.

Some of McClellan's crit-
ics go on to make a point
which is now a great favor-
ite with Walter Reuther
and others. They say that
the committee should now
proceed to investigate the
"evils" of management.

This point has been co-
gently answered by Robert
Kennedy, the committee's
counsel. He says that there
are plenty of Congressional
committees digging into
management and business,
but that the McClellan com-
mittee is limited to union-
management relations. In
that connection there may
be many evildoers uncov-
ered in management. But
the committee has no gen-
eral hunting license to
make a general investiga-
tion of business manage-
ment.

Another point is involved
which the critics of Mc-
Clellan seem to miss. Most
of the Beck revelations
have nothing to do with
management. They have to
do with matters entirely
within the union. For the
misuse of union funds is an
internal affair. It was no
fault of management that
Beck was able to borrow at
will from the union treas-
ury for purposes which
were entirely his own.
