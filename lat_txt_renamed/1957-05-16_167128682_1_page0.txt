BUDGET LEADERSHIP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If Congress succeeds in
materially reducing the
budget request of the
President for fiscal 1958, it
will not only be a big sur-
prise to informed observ-
ers of the national scene,
but it will mark a momen-
tous shift in the traditional
functions of the legislative
and executive departments
of the government.

The present budget sys-
tem—created in the latter
years of the Wilson admin-
istration and put into oper-
ation under President Har-
ding—was based upon the
principle that economical
government would be pos-
sible only under Presiden-
tial leadership. This is a
fact easily proved in the
debates and discussions of
those years which Presi-
dent Eisenhower and his
advisers, including the
present budget director, do
not seem to understand.

For the curse of our na-
tional government in the
years preceding the adop-
tion of the executive budg-
et was "log-rohing." The
executive department sent
its estimated needs to Con-
gress, and the committees
there mulled them over and
submitted them, revised, to
the two houses for passage
as a series of appropriation
measures.

Included in the appropri-
ations finally passed, how-
ever, were all sorts of items
inserted because of the
pressure of special and sec-
tional interests. Members
of Congress, responsive to
those pressures, got their
own items included by
trading with other mem-
bers. The Congressman
from a district in Califor-
nia would get his reclama-
tion project approved by
trading with a New Eng-
lander who wanted a high-
er tariff on textiles, etc.
The result was a mass of
special legislation.

*

The executive budget
was based on the proposi-
tion that the President, and
the President alone, repre-
sented the nation. He, and
only he, could scan all the
special interests and sec-
tions and put the national
interest in first place. The
method by which he was
intended to operate was to
have a budget director, re-
sponsible only to the Presi-
dent, who would do the pa-
per work incidental to the
President's judgment.

The budget recently pre-
sented by President Eisen-
hower to Congress was not
representative of the na-
tional interest. The execu-
tive department, through
plenty of pressure from
members of Congress inter-
ested in special projects,
has included scores of items
to satisfy local and sec-
tional wants, not needs.
And, curiously enough, it is
the leaders of Congress—
leaders of both parties—
who are struggling to put
the national interest first.

*

If I may pursue the his-
torical course further, the
entire matter recalls the
days of the Tudors and
Stuarts, when the House
of Commons represented
not the getting end of fiscal
policy but the giving end.
The Kings and Queens
came to the Commons ask-
ing for money to run the
government.

The Commons, repre-
senting mostly the cities
and sections where there
was taxable property, gave
with great circumspection.
That was the tradition
which the American Consti-
tution embodied in the
principle that revenue bills
should originate in the
House of Representatives.
But the practice of log-roll-
ing changed that and trans-
formed Congress into a
"getting," not "giving"
branch of government.

*

The universal grasp of
the income tax has mean-
while taken from members
of Congress a sense of re-
sponsibility for the tax
burden. Perhaps the Presi-
dent may again assume his
role as the protector of the
national interest, but the
prospects for any such res-
toration under this admin-
istration are not too bright.

Meanwhile, the leaders
of Congress deserve praise
for attempting something
for which they were never
qualified or directed by law
or constitution.
