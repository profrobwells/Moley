RAYMOND MOLEY:
Straining at Gnats,
Swallowing Camels
In the heated debate last
week on the housing meas-
ure, Pennsylvania's Sen.
Clark said, in connection
with a tour he had made
through the slum and de-
pressed sections of Wash-
ington, something about
"the hungry children of the
District of Columbia, of
which the Senator from Or-
egon was chairman."
I am sure that the Sen-
ator from Oregon would be
an excellent chairman for
these unfortunate children.
But his concern extends
also in a romantic fashion
--presumably under the in-
fluence of the coming of
June--to those who will be
newlyweds during the
month. They should not be
denied, he said, "that great
investment in America's
freedom--a private home."
Despite the emotional im-
pact of this plea, the bill
as finally enacted by the
Senate and sent to confer-
ence was much less gen-
erous than that passed by
the House.
★
The House bill (HR
6659) authorized new
spending authority for
housing programs totaling
$2,851,000,000. This would
be in excess of the Presi-
dent's budget requests by
no less than $1,825,000,000.
Thus the House, despite
all the tall talk about slash-
ing the budget, would wipe
out all its savings and much
more in a single bill.
The Senate bill as final-
ly passed, after the adop-
tion of an amendment by
Sen. Bricker, would pro-
vide authorizations totaling
$375,000,000 for three pro-
grams not requested by the
President and would add
another slum-clearance au-
thorization of $250,000,000
for fiscal 1959.
It is to be expected, more-
over, that when the bill
comes out of conference the
compromise will be consid-
erably above the Senate
version.
In his statement Sen.
Byrd sharply underlined
the utter irresponsibility of
such legislation:
"For those who may be
unclear as to what 'authori-
ty to spend from debt re-
ceipts' means, the budget
document defines it as 'au-
thorization to make ex-
penditures from borrowed
money.'
"It might be described as
an appropriation of funds
to be borrowed by the
Treasury, in contrast to an
appropriation of funds in
the general fund by virtue
of ordinary receipts.
"When these housing
agencies are authorized to
spend from debt receipts it
simply means that on their
demand the Treasury must
go out and sell bonds and
provide the money.
★
"Authorization to spend
out of public debt receipts
is the most vicious of all
appropriation devices. It
not only bypasses appropri-
ation control, it piles up
Federal debt...
"... When this authori-
zation bill is passed there
will never be another look
at it by Congress. The
appropriations committees
will never hear of it. There
is little that the President
and the Budget Bureau can
do to control its expendi-
ture. There is nothing the
Treasury can do to hold
down the increase in the
debt it authorizes."
The opportunity will
therefore present itself to
the President by one bold
stroke to reveal the hypoc-
risy of all the talk in Con-
gress about reducing the
President's budget and to
put himself on the side of
the taxpayer. He can and
should veto the bill which
finally is sent to his desk.
Congress, he might say,
has been straining at gnats
and swallowing camels.
