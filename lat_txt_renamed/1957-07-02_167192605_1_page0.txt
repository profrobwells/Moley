RAYMOND MOLEY:
Some Reflections on
a Monetary Disaster
This is the week in
which we celebrate our na-
tional independence with
appropriate speeches, hol-
idays, parties, and automo-
bile wrecks. I suggest that
a moment be given to a
consideration of another
anniversary, also falling
within the week, but which
no one wants to celebrate.
On July 2, 1933, President
Roosevelt dispatched to the
U.S. delegation at the so-
called London Economic
Conference an amazing
message. It threw not only
the U.S. delegation but
everyone else into such
chaos that the conference
died a few days later. Quite
appropriately, it has been
called the "bombshell mes-
sage," and there have
been few, even among the
most ardent worshippers of
the late President, who
have cared to defend it.
In the spring of that
year, Roosevelt had taken
the United States off the
gold standard and had
thrown international ex-
changes into a great deal of
confusion. Therefore, the
nations that met in Lon-
don on June 12 for the con-
ference were urgently con-
cerned in getting some kind
of agreement to stabilize
their currencies in relation
to each other.
This desire was even
true in a lesser degree of
most of the members of the
American delegation. The
instructions they had been
given by President Roose-
velt had been to agree
"that it is in the interests
of all concerned that sta-
bility in the international
monetary field be attained
as quickly as practicable,
and that gold should be
re-established as the in-
ternational measure of ex-
change values."
Attempts by the Amerl-
can delegation to arrive at
such an agreement, how-
ever, had been rejected by
the President.
★
I was dispatched by the
President to see what could
be done, and after arrival
I secured an agreement in
almost exactly the terms of
his instructions above. In
short, that at some time in
the future the matter
would be settled at a defi-
nite figure. Even this
harmless gesture was re-
jected by the President, al-
though it had the approval
of the Secretary and Under-
secretary of the Treasury,
of Bernard Baruch, who
was advising the President,
and of all the experts who
had been appointed by
him.
It is a matter of record
now that the influences
which moved him to this
strange reversal of his own
instructions were Louis
Howe, who professedly
knew nothing of public
finance, and Henry Mor-
genthau Jr. They were
with the President on the
ship on which he was cruis-
ing. Morgenthau was not
yet Secretary of the Treas-
ury. It is also a matter of
record that some time after
he was appointed to that
post, his major advisor on
international finance was
the late Harry Dexter
White.
★
The cream of the jest is
the language of the "bomb-
shell" regarding inflation
and balanced budgets.
In the message Roose-
velt said that "the United
States seeks the kind of
dollar which a generation
hence will have the same
purchasing and debt-pay-
ing power as the dollar we
hope to attain in the near
future." Now, 24 years lat-
er, the dollar of 1933 is
worth about 45 cents.
Roosevelt also chided
the nations for not balanc-
ing their budgets. The rec-
ord shows that under his
Presidency there were no
balanced budgets, and
eight of his fiscal years
were peacetime years.
Not until fiscal 1947 was
there a surplus. The total
of the F.D.R. deficits for
the first seven of the peace-
time years was $54,110,000,-
000. And Henry Morgen-
thau Jr., who in his diary
recorded his pleasure at the
President's "bombshell
message," largely, it seems,
because it was supposed to
injure me, was Secretary of
the Treasury during those
years.
★
As for Roosevelt's repu-
diation of a mild promise
to stabilize currencies in
the future and to return to
gold "as a measure of ex-
change values," the events
soon repudiated him. Two
weeks after his "bomb-
shell," he was compelled to
orde: the shipment of gold.
Six months later, he asked
Congress to authorize a
stabilization agreement.
And his effort to adjust
prices by the Warren meth-
od of changing the value of
gold was a dismal failure.
The great pragmatist was
"hoist with his own
petard."
There was a much more
serious aspect to the
"bombshell" diplomacy for
the late President. That
message in 1933 sent every
delegate in every European
country home with the feel-
ing that international ac-
tion was futile. National-
ism was the order from
then on—a nationalism
which plunged the nations
into the horrors of World
War II.
