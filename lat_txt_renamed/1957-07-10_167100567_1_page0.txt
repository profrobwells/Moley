PORTLAND, Or.—This
automobile trip, which began
in New York and carried
me through the Northwest,
offered many opportunities
to view the problems which
are already confronting
those responsible for the
construction of the great
Federal highway system.
Foremost among those
problems is the acquisition
of the right of way. As most
State, county and local
communities have learned
at great expense, this is a
time-consuming, vastly
expensive, and often graft-
ridden business. The problem
is especially grave in
getting in and out of congested
urban areas, through
mountainous regions, and,
in fact, over the long
stretches of level land. The
more I have seen of this,
the more I am intrigued by
an idea developed by D.
Walter Swan when he was
Deputy Assistant Secretary
of Defense. His suggestion is
that the Federal government
work out arrangements
with the nation’s railroads
for the use of practicable
portions of their 220,000
miles of existing rights of
way. In rural areas, the plan
would run highways on one
or both sides of the railroad.
In thickly settled areas the
same idea could be worked
out, or in spots the highway
could be constructed above
the railroad tracks.
Anyone who has tried to
drive into Chicago from the
east in recent years must be
struck by the tortuous route
he followed. And yet there
are many railroad lines
which move directly to their
stations downtown. The railroads
have already fought and won
the battle with landowners.
In many cases, modern
means of signaling, improved
rolling stock and diesel
power have made some of
the trackage expendable. An
illustration of this is the
abandonment of two of the
four tracks over a considerable
part of the New York Central
system.
The modern interchange
on a high-speed highway is a
vast and sprawling and
immensely expensive affair.
In metropolitan areas this
means disruption on a major
scale. If the highway should
be an elevated expressway
over the tracks, access ramps
would care for the exits and
entrances. Highway engineers,
according to Swan, estimate
that it costs no more to build
an elevated expressway than
to utilize an abandoned
railway right of way.
In rural areas the damages
originally created on adjoining
property have long been
liquidated. Stretching a
roadway parallel to a railway
means only taking a continuous
strip of land through back
lots already depreciated in
value. But cutting a turnpike
through new areas means
splitting up parcels of land,
frequently leaving odd-shaped
and useless remnants.
Railroads should be keenly
interested in the Swan idea
because it would mean
considerable revenue. It would
also mean increasing the value
of adjacent railway property.
Such a plan would not only
attract considerable business,
industrial and residential
development. More important,
it would avoid the serious
consideration of “drying up”
villages and towns now often
blithely bypassed by sweeps of
super-highways. Also, the
relocation of residents and
businesses would be greatly
reduced.
With delays in the big
Federal highway project
already widespread, there is
time to examine this interesting
suggestion.
