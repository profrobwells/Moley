TO PAUL FROM PETER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A reader of these essays
of mine, resident in an East-
ern State, has asked in a
wholly friendly letter why
I have written so often
about the problems of the
Northwest, especially
about the Hells Canyon
controversy.
I have answered that one
good reason is that many
of my contemporary col-
umnists have energetically
supported those members
of Congress and others who
want to scrap the three
dams now under construc-
tion by the Idaho Power
Co. and begin on a Federal
project which cannot be
completed for years. I feel,
therefore, that one writer
who takes the other side
and who over a period of
six years has studied the
problem on the ground has
a duty to present the facts
of the case.
¥
Another reason is illus-
trated by an article that
appeared recently in a De-
troit paper. Two Michigan
Congressmen, Elford A.
Cederberg of Bay City and
Gerald R. Ford Jr. of
Grand Rapids, have joined
in a contention that the
building of the Hells Can-
yon dam by the Federal
government is of genuine
economic concern to the
citizens of Michigan. Not
only would the develop-
ment of subsidized Federal
power in the Northwest
draw industry from East-
ern and Midwestern States,
but the cost of that subsi-
dized power would be im-
posed upon all the taxpay-
ers of the nation, including,
of course, the heavily taxed
people of Michigan.
Cederberg is quoted as
saying:
"It is a serious thing
when industry moves away
from Michigan, whether
due to internal policies of
a State administration or
because they are attracted
elsewhere. It is hardly
more serious when Michi-
gan citizens are Federally
taxed to provide projects
in other areas which will
attract Michigan indus-
tries. This is the case of
the Hells Canyon project."
Cederberg went on to
state that $36,000,000 of
the $651,000,000 needed to
build the Federal dam
would come from Michigan
taxpayers.
Ford stated that "the
passage of the bill would
mean that the development
of 'cheap hydroelectric
power in the Pacific
Northwest with Federal
funds would entice indus-
try and consequently em-
ployment out of our own
State, Michigan, into that
area."
These Michigan Con-
gressmen might have add-
ed another pungent re-
minder to the people of
Michigan, notably that
great number of citizens
who are members of Wal-
ter Reuther's United Auto-
mobile Workers.
*
They might have said
that it is bad enough for
their leader, Reuther, to
be laboring for Federal
power not only in the
Northwest but every-
where. But it really is
tough to use the funds con-
tributed by those union
members to support the
Hells Canyon Association,
which is an organization in
the Northwest dedicated to
fight to the end to get Fed-
eral money for Hells Can-
yon and other Federal
projects.
On the list of contribu-
tors to the Hells Canyon
Association — sent out to
unions in Oregon by the
head of that association,
who is also a union official
on Oregon — these items
appear: Reuther's UAW,
$4000, and his CIO, $5000.
It is rubbing it in when
union members are com-
pelled to contribute their
own money for the privi-
lege of adding to their tax-
es and of weakening the
industrial structure of their
State.
