Superficially, the State of
California looks like a Re-
publican stronghold. Its Re-
publican leadership has
been resplendent and suc-
cessful. Republicans have
occupied the Governorship
for 15 years. One of its sons
is Vice-President; another
is the Republican leader
in the Senate. Republi-
cans occupy 17 of the 30
California seats in the
House of Representatives.
National attention is riv-
eted upon the rival ambi-
tions of its favorite sons.
Everybody wants to know
whether California will pre-
fer Nixon or Knowland for
its pitch for the Presiden-
tial nomination in 1960, and
whether Knowland will
seek to unseat Gov. Knight
next year. A Democratic
Congressman has suggest-
ed Chief Justice Warren for
the Democratic nomination
for President in 1960.
But something more im-
portant than the fortunes
of these individuals is de-
voloping here in California,
And a few shrewd political
leaders in the labor move-
ment like Walter Reuther
are very much concerned
with it. Presidents, and
Vice-Presidents, and Gov-
ernors, and Senators may
come and go, but when a
powerful political machine
establishes itself in a State,
it controls affairs for a long,
long time. The AFL-CIO
Committee on Political
Education is just that sort
of machine.
In 1956 COPE put in
some licks toward defeat-
ing Republican Sen. Ku-
chel, but its real aim was
in another direction. It
practically ignored its hap-
less preference for Presi-
dent, Adlai Stevenson. But
it went deeply into the
various campaigns for seats
in the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives and the Califor-
nia State Legislature. It
was playing for the long
pull.
Reuther and company
are not interested in super-
ficialities. They are inter-
ested in turning California
into another Michigan.
That is, another State in
which the name Democrat-
ic is used as a convenient
cover for COPE-a State
like Michigan, in which
all the State-wide offices,
a good part of the Legisla-
ture, one U.S. Senator, and
a number of Congressmen
are indebted to the Reuther
machine for their jobs, or a
State like Oregon, which is
almost as completely
COPEized as Michigan.
The invasion of the po-
litical arms of the unions
has been going on in Cali-
fornia for some time! In
1948, when President Tru-
man carried the State, 59%
of the vote for members of
the House of Representa-
tives was Republican. But
things were happening in
the districts in the four
years that followed, and
despite the Eisenhower
sweep of the State in 1952,
the Republican vote for
Congressmen was cut to
54%.
Then there followed four
more years of work by the
CIO-PAC, and by its suc-
cessor, COPE.
Despite the rout of Ste-
venson by Eisenhower in
1956, the Republican vote
for Congressmen dropped
to 46%. That is a drop of
13% in Republican
strength in a period of un-
precedented prosperity and
of Republican Presidential
voting, and with a Califor-
nian running for Vice-
President.
Meanwhile, Democrats
backed by the unions have
replaced Republicans in
two districts and have
made the margin mighty
close in hitherto Republi-
can strongholds. The trend
seems to be to reduce safe
Republican seats to margi-
nal seats, and Republican
marginal seats to Demo-
cratic seats, and to turn
marginal Democratic seats
into safe Democratic seats.
In another article I shall
show what has been hap-
pening in the State Legisla-
ture and what the ultimate
plans of COPE are for con-
trol of the State.
