CONSENT
IN LAW
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since both Vice-Presi-
dent Nixon and Senate Ma-
jority Leader Lyndon B.
Johnson are concerned
with the fine art of politics
(and who in public office
is not?), it seems to me that
the man from Texas has
definitely the better of
their argument about the
jury-trial amendment to
the civil rights bill.
For not only is this turn
toward moderation pleas-
ing to the South, but it is,
in my judgment, agreeable
to a great majority of the
sensible people of the rest
of the nation. I greatly fear
that the Vice-President,
usually as sensitive to the
atmosphere of public opin-
ion as is a morning glory to
the rising sun, is missing a
very important shift in
northern sentiment which
has been under way for
some years and which has
quite evidently crystallized
this year.

Surely I am willing to
admit that when anyone
ventures a guess about so
broad a matter as "public
opinion," he should, with
or without Gallup, indicate
that he has some concrete
evidence to back up his
opinion.
In my case I can claim
some sense of public senti-
ment because I have within
two months crossed the na-
tion from coast to coast. I
have talked with plenty of
people, including shrewd
newspapermen. And I have
found a pronounced and
prevalent inclination to-
ward moderation in any
civil rights legislation.
To be sure, if one isy cal-
culating on swinging
enough Negro votes in
strategic sections of north-
ern cities, he will see po-
litical advantage in a dras-
tic civil rights act. But this
is a somewhat narrow way
to appraise political advan-
lage. For there are millions
of people other than these
minorities, whose senti-
ments about coercing the
South have greatly changed
in the past decade or two.
The simple reason for
this is that the northern
cities have acquired some
valuable lessons in the
problems involved in cre-
ating equality by law.
They have learned that the
South has a serious prob-
lem which cannot be solved
except by moderation,
gradualism, or what you
will. And as Americans,
these Northerners are not
inclined to engage in any
attempt to hurry the proc-
ess of evolution by any
means that suggests the
abandonment of strict con-
stitutional guarantees.
When opponents of a
guarantee of jury trial
claim that southern juries
will not convict white peo-
ple for a denial of suffrage
to Negroes, and that to
meet this failure of justice
there should be no juries,
they are taking on a very
serious assumption. They
are assuming that it is wise
public policy to enact legis-
lation that is objectionable
to at least a quarter of the
population of the nation.
We have a program here
following an ancient prin-
ciple. "the consent of the
governed." In a careful ef-
fort to define this principle
in a book, I wrote this:
"What, then, is consent?
Is it mere resignation to the
inevitable? Is it agreement
that, under proof, can be
shown to be deceitful and
fraudulent?
"Consent is real when
those involved freely,
knowingly, willingly, and
with a part in creating the
decision, enter into the
benefits and responsibili-
ties involved in carrying
out the decision."
The North has had some
experience with attempting
to create consent by mere
majority power. It still re-
calls the era of prohibition.
It sees also, every day, in
every one of its cities, the
theory of racial equality de-
nied by the fact of discrim-
ination,
