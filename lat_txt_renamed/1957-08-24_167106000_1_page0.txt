RAYMOND MOLEY:
About the Selection
of Our Ambassadors
I introduce this essay
on knowing and being by
offering a bit of knowledge
of my own. This consists
of the fact that a philoso-
pher named Descartes, or
Kant, or Berkeley, or
somebody said something
like "I know, therefore I
am."
I don't happen to have
the encyclopedia here, or
I would be more precise.
Anyhow, by the time this
is processed by my assist-
ant, the correct name will
appear. (Mr. Moley proba-
bly means Descartes: "I
think, therefore I am."
Assistant's note.)
My quotation is near
enough to provide a place
to hang a personal observa-
tion that there are some
things not worth knowing,
and some things not worth
being.
*
I am not surprised that
Matthew Gluck did not
know the name of the
Prime Minister of Ceylon.
What I am wondering
about is what he wanted to
be. For why should anyone
with $30,000 to give away
want to be Ambassador to
Ceylon?
Diplomatic history has
many other examples of
slips of knowledge. The
late Cordell Hull while
Secretary of State stopped
momentarily at a port in
Eire. In a flourishing greet-
ing written by the faithful
ghost, Charley Michelson,
the Secretary applied the
term "republic" to that fa-
mous island west of Eng-
land. Whereupon, there
was a great hullabaloo in
the British press. For the
royal government at all
costs wanted the world to
believe that Eire was not
free and independent. Ul-
timately, Hull was forgiv-
en and not forgotten when
lend-lease came into being.
*
What I am really getting
at is a still greater lapse of
knowledge. This one is
scored against the Presi-
dent of the United States.
For when a reporter sug-
gested in a press confer-
ence that the Gluck ap-
pointment had something
to do with a contribution
of $30,000, the President
flew into a rage. He would
have all and sundry know
that, after a patient search
over the nation for a man
with the precise qualifica-
tions to be Ambassador to
Ceylon, they found Mat-
thew Gluck. It was a mere
coincidence that Gluck
should have helped the
great crusade "meet its
television bills. I am not
willing to attribute the
Presidential ire to the re-
porter's suggestion. Per-
haps it was the hot weath-
er. Or maybe it was Con-
gress that bothered him.
*
Surely he knows that
our Ambassador to the
Court of St. James's was an
efficient collector of funds
for the Republican cam-
paign fund. And that the
Ambassador's sister con-
tributed more than twice
as much as Gluck's miser-
able offering. Did he know
that a man named Dillon
went to France after chip-
ping in a considerable sum?
Or that her recent excel-
lency, the Ambassador to
Italy, Mrs. Luce, and her
husband each came through
with a sum about equal to
that given by Gluck?
Democrats never have
been so sensitive about
such things. In 1933 a list
of "suggestions" came over
to the State Department
from the Democratic Na-
tional Committee for Am-
bassadorships.
*
There was also commu-
nicated, not in writing,
how much these candidates
had contributed. Special
favor was given to people
who had helped Mr. Roose-
velt get the nomination.
These were called RBCs
â€”which meant Roosevelt-
before-Chicago. High on
that list were Robert Bing-
ham and Jesse Straus.
These were authentic
RBCs, and they landed in
Britain and France. Some-
what delayed in appoint-
ment was another contrib-
utor, Joseph Patrick Ken-
nedy. He rated St. James's.
I can remember when a
country like Ceylon was
knocked down for a few
hundred dollars. But that
was before inflation.
Time was when a friend-
ly nation was offered a
compliment by the appoint-
ment of a most distin-
guished American in his
own right. Such were Ben-
jamin Franklin, Charles
Francis Adams, and oth-
ers. But now the compli-
ment is not to the receiv-
ing nation but to the giver
of gifts.
Perhaps our government
has decided that when we
have given of our substance
in foreign aid it would be
overgenerous to give our
most distinguished sons,
too.
