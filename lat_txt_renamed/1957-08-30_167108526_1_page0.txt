Washington observers
who are puzzled by the de-
clining importance of the
farm bloc in Congress
might learn a lot about the
cause by a visit to the lush
San Joaquin Valley of Cal-
ifornia.
In past years the power
of the Congressional farm
bloc was based upon mil-
lions of farm votes and the
many needs and demands
of the farmers who had
those votes. But when the
number of votes declined
so did the importance of
the farm bloc. For mecha-
nization and larger and
fewer farm units mean not
only more production with
fewer workers but a fun-
damental change in farm
economics and farmer out-
look.
I discussed this change
with a resident of Bakers-
field who has the right to
the much-abused charac-
terization of agricultural
statesman. He is to be dis-
tinguished from the farm
politicians who in the past
have so largely made up
the Congressional farm
bloc. For William B. Camp
wants no public office and,
unlike most farm politi-
cians, really owns and suc-
cessfully operates planta-
tions in the South and a
ranch in the San Joaquin
Valley.
He is, incidentally, a
notable farmer-business-
man and, as such, is chair-
man of the Committee on
Agriculture of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. His
discussion of the changing
nature of the farm econo-
my should be of immense
value in interpreting fu-
ture political patterns in
this country.
More than a year ago the
Eisenhower administration
and its embattled Secre-
tary of Agriculture Ben-
son were under attack by
the opposition for their al-
leged neglect of the farm-
er, and there was predict-
ed a farm "revolt" which
might defeat the President
in the election. At that
time I made a study of the
so-called farm vote.
The figures I found in-
dicated that the voters liv-
ing on farms and affected
by the farm recession were
so widely scattered and so
few that their disaffection
would have little or no ef-
fect upon the election.
Some facts presented by
Mr. Camp may well account
for this change. He points
out not only that the num-
ber of people required to
produce food and fiber di-
rectly has declined a great
deal in the past 15 years
but that a great. many of
those farmers who are left
earn a part of their income
from some source other
than by raising and selling
farm products.
Camp points out that
while the old "family size"
farm is passing into history
with the horse and the buf-
falo, the number of "family
operated" farms is grow-
ing. There has been a
steady consolidation of
small farms into larger
ones and this is a normal,
healthy sign of our chang-
ing times. He cites some
amazing statistics to prove
this. Even in the past four
years the number of farms
has declined 10%. This is
at the rate of 120,000 farms
a year. Anti-Benson and
anti-Eisenhower politicians
would have us believe that
this is a matter of tragic
concern. But it merely
means a change from the
old "family size" farms to
"family operated" farms.
Moreover, so far as the
condition of the farmer
generally is concerned, this
is not a bad sign. "Farmers
are not being liquidated,"
Camp says. "They are be-
ing elevated to a higher
standard of living." New
industries related to agri-
culture are taking in thou-
sands of former farmers,
while those who are ex-
panding the size of their
farms are making more
money.
In an area like the San
Joaquin Valley, the coming
of larger farm units togeth-
er with corporate farming
has meant an increasing
unionization of farm work-
ers. Hence, we shall see, as
time goes on, more and
more political action by the
AFL-CIO Committee on Po-
litical Education in areas
formerly regarded as whol-
ly rural. Evidence of this
is already apparent in the
trends in California, Ore-
gon and Washington.
This is only one piece of
evidence that we are mov-
ing into a new civilization,
and our traditional politi-
cal methods and calcula-
tions must be drastically
revised.
