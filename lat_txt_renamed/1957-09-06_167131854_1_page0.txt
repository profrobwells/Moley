COLLECTIVE
SCHOOLS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Speaking at a convention
of the American Federation
of Teachers, a union, the
president of that organiza-
tion, Carl J. Megel, let a
large woolly cat out of the
bag. He said, among other
things:
"Federal aid to education
represents a transition
from property tax to a cor-
porate and personal income
tax."
There, in a sentence, is
the explanation of the pas-
sionate drive for starting
the Federalization of
schools. These teachers,
who are far from a repre-
sentative group of the vast
army of men and women
who are educating the chil-
dren of America, are neces-
sarily irked at local control
of schools. For under the
conditions that have tra-
ditionally prevailed, and
thanks to the common
sense of Congress that still
prevails, the parents of
children are actually able
to have some authority in
the determining of how
their schools shall be op-
erated and what their chil-
dren shall be taught.
★
The lever by which this
authority is maintained is
the solid economic fact that
those parents are taxpay-
ers and, as such, have the
incentive to take some in-
terest in how their money
is being spent. Their school
boards, elected by them,
are their means of main-
taining watchfulness over
their schools.
Moreover, there is a
sound justification for the
property tax since it is, in
part at least, a land tax
which is not a penalty on
incentive and individual
enterprise.
The proceedings of the
AFT convention, reported
in detail in the AFL-CIO
News for Aug. 24, indicate
the happy vision enter-
tained by these teachers:
With ample funds for all
the trimmings now so gen-
erally considered to be a
part of school, with salaries
starting at $6000 and pro-
gressing to $12,000, with
absolute security of tenure,
with educational material
coming from a bureaucracy
in Washington which
would be dominated by the
national power of the
teachers' union, with no
bothersome local board to
bother with, and no par-
ents able to say things
about how it is their mon-
ey, etc.—this is the heaven
of a collectivist.

What does it matter that
in the process the teacher
loses his liberty to experi-
ment under the permissive
authority of a school board
which can be seen and
talked with? In short, what
is liberty, anyhow, when
such sugar-coated security
is assured?
The AFT convention was
assured by its president
and other speakers, includ-
ing AFL-CIO people, by a
demonstration of slick eco-
nomics that if the cost of
running the schools were
all unloaded on the Federal
income tax, the money
would come from what was
called "the enormous earn-
ings" of corporations and
rich individuals. Presum-
ably, these teachers are
propagating that sort of rot
in their classes, not men-
tioning that a Federal cor-
poration income tax is in
reality an excise to be
passed on to the very peo-
ple who believe they are
getting a free ride.
★
I found nothing in the
account of the convention
to indicate that these world
savers are concerned about
the uneconomical school
year, which uses the school
plants only nine or 10
months, or the injustice to
teachers who must live 12
months on the pay they re-
ceive for the part time that
they teach. A bit of ingenu-
ity by school administrators
might well relieve the al-
leged shortage of teachers
and schoolrooms and also
provide more pay for teach-
ers.
That sort of readjust-
ment of a school year de-
vised for the days when
children had to go to work
in the fields during the
summer is not a part of the
collectivist plan. It smacks
of efficiency, a nasty word
in the lexicon of progres-
sive education.
