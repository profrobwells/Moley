RAYMOND MOLEY:
Public Power Politics
Delays Trinity Project
Congress adjourned with
several useful reclamation
and power projects unnec-
essarily stymied. Reason
for this can be squarely laid
at the door of public-power
zealots in Congress who are
willing to deny their con-
stituents needed power and
water rather than to agree
to the administration's par-
nership policy. One case is
the Trinity River Project
in Northern California.
This plan is designed to
build large reservoirs on
the Trinity River in the far
north of California and to
carry the water through
tunnels over to the Sacra-
mento River somewhat be-
low the Shasta Dam and
thus provide additional
supplies for irrigation and
other purposes in the val-
leys below. The falling wa-
ter, on its way from river to
river, would be usable for
the generation of a large
supply of electric power.
*
The Federal government
has authorized and is build-
ing the project. The Pacific
Gas & Electric Co., with
very large operations
throughout Northern Cali-
fornia, has offered to build
and pay for the power facil-
ities, to pay full value for
the falling water involved,
and to distribute the power
to customers through its
regional system.
This proposal, it seems, is
a perfect example of the
President's partnership pol-
icy, with equitable treat-
ment of all parties con-
cerned.
After study, the Secre-
tary of the Interior last
February reported to Con-
gress that the PGE plan
met his approval. He
pointed out that the com-
pany's plan would provide
$165,000,000 for the govern-
ment in project revenues
over the 50 years of life of
the project, as well as $135,-
000,000 in Federal, State
and local taxes. It would
also save the nation's tax-
payers an additional $56,-
000,000 on the total cost
of the project.
*
But opposition to the
idea was immediately
voiced by certain newspa-
pers, by Chairman Clair
Engle of the House Interior
Committee and, to the sur-
prise of many, by Republi-
can Sen. Kuchel.
Subsequently, Secretary
of the Interior Seaton re-
vised his estimates some-
what but without any ma-
terial change in the public
benefits of the PGE plan.
The opposition's claim
rests upon an alleged in-
crease in the cost of power
to the so-called preference
customers in the region.
This means those public
agencies which are getting
power from the Greater
Central Valley electrical
installations. Such agen-
cies are tax free and they
get their power at what is
really a subsidized price
now. The price charged by
the PGE is, of course,
strictly regulated by the
State of California. Thus
there is no gouging in that
direction.
*
Sen. Kuchel interposed a
curious objection. He said
that if Congress should ap-
prove the Federal-PGE
partnership plan, it would
be necessary to repeal the
preference provision in the
entire Central Valley Proj-
ect. Since the preference
clause is regarded as a holy
of holies by public-power
advocates, this would be
treasonable. In this case
the so-called preference
customers might, if they
had wished, have applied
for the privilege of building
the power plants in the
Trinity project themselves.
None of them did so apply.
Their claim in this case
is that the Federal govern-
ment is under some sort of
solemn obligation to build
power plants for their use.
There is no such obligation.
It is the recognized policy
of the government that
there may be leases or
licenses to private compa-
nies as long as no public-
power authority turns up
with the means and the
wish to secure the rights it-
self. Moreover, the people
served by the PGE in this
instance are California citi-
zens, just as much entitled
to the benefits of a Federal
project as those who hap-
pen to live in a city or oth-
er community served by a
public-power agency.
*
The rapidly growing area
served by PGE needs the
additional power. The big
Central Valley Project
would profit from the reve-
nue paid by PGE for the
temporary use of the wa-
ter. And certainly the na-
tion's taxpayers would wel-
come paying $56,000,000
less for the project â€” an
amount supplied by private
investors under the PGE
plan.
However, Chairman En-
gle, who is said to be ey-
ing the seat to be vacated
by Knowland next year,
has apparently determined
to make an issue of the
case. And so the legislation
has gone over to next year,
when there will be pro-
tracted hearings.
