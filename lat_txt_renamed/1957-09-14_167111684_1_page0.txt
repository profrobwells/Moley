RAYMOND MOLEY:
Concentrated Power
Party System Peril
At a most simulating but
friendly inquisition to
which I was subjected at
the Phoenix (Ariz.) Press
Club, the question was
raised as to why I regard-
ed with so much concern
the domination of the Dem-
ocratic Party by the politi-
cal arms of the two great
labor federations.
The answer to the ques-
tion goes back to the essen-
tial ideal of a two-party
system in a country as
large as this, living under
a form of government
which constitutionally di-
vides powers among the
several States and the Fed-
eral establishment. In that
sort of country a political
party must, if it is to sur-
vive and elect Presidents,
appeal to many interests—
economic, social and sec-
tional. Whenever a single
interest becomes dominant,
the party is endangered
and the result will be ei-
ther a one-party system or
a multiparty system like
that of France. In either
case, there is a peril to our
institutions.

At the turn of the cen-
tury there was undue con-
trol of the Republican Par-
ty by large corporate in-
terests. This, as was cor-
rectly pointed out by Mr.
Justice Frankfurter speak-
ing for the Supreme Court
last March in the United
Automobile Workers case,
meant "the subversion of
the electoral process." But
as Frankfurter went on to
say, the great growth of the
labor unions during World
War II and after offered a
like threat. He said, "Just
as the great corporations
had made huge political
contributions to influence
governmental action, the
powerful unions were pur-
suing a similar course, and
with the same untoward
consequences for the dem-
ocratic process."
In the first instance, 50
years ago, Congress pro-
hibited corporations from
making contributions and
expenditures for political
purposes in Federal elec-
tions. Ten years ago, in the
Taft-Hartley Act, labor or-
ganizations were put under
exactly the same prohibi-
tion.
Thus, there is not only
the experience of history
to sustain the concern of
Sen. Goldwater and others
about the vast power of
the political machine of
the unions, dominated as
it is by the incredibly as-
tute Walter Reuther, but
there is the considered pol-
icy of Congress as embod-
ied in the legislation of
1907 and 1947, and also
this notable opinion of the
Supreme Court, speaking
through Mr. Justice Frank-
furter.

There used to be a great
amount of talk about the
similarity of the policies
of the two parties. A well-
worn expression was that
they were two bottles con-
taining the same stuff, but
with different labels. Also,
there were jokes about the
generality of the two party
platforms. This, it was
said, was hypocrisy com-
pounded. And there was a
demand, which is still
heard, for revamping of
the party system, with one
party conservative and the
other radical.
However, in the light of
all experience and wisdom,
if hypocrisy was ever jus-
tified, it was in this case.
For each of the two par-
ties should represent a
universality of interests.
And the contest between
them should be over the
question of which one is
truly representative of all.
When one of the two par-
ties is dominated by a sin-
gle interest, it behooves
the other to offer opposi-
tion on that ground.

In scanning an interest-
ing book soon to be pub-
lished—a book written by
a former colleague of mine,
Rex Tugwell, there was
recalled to my mind a
phrase which I persuaded
Candidate Roosevelt to use
in 1932. It was that his
party should represent "a
concert of interests." There
could be no more expres-
sive ideal for any party.
For a "concert of interests"
means that a party stresses
the great common interests
that should tie us all to-
gether and cement nation-
al unity. Whatever seeks
to emphasize what divides
us, subverts the integrity
of the nation and its gov-
ernment.
This is not a mere ac-
ademic matter. It is the
most vital and practical
domestic issue that faces
the American people.
