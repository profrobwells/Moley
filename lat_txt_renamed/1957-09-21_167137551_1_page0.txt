RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Change in Chairs
but Not in Policy
The name of Lemuel R.
Boulware has come to be
intimately associated with
certain constructive pol-
icies in labor and public
relations in the General
Electric Co. These have to
do with a frank and open
information service de-
signed to foster unity
among the vast number of
stockholders, management
personnel, and 280,000 em-
ployees of the company.
Boulware has also pro-
vided encouragement and
direction to the many offi-
cers of the company, scat-
tered as they are over the
entire nation, to the end
that they may be more use-
ful and constructive mem-
bers of the communities in
which they are located. In
this latter program, the
fundamental lesson of ac-
tive participation in com-
munity, State and national
affairs—social, economic
and political—is stressed.
The labor union of which
many of the employees of
the company are members,
the International Union of
Electrical Workers, is
headed by James B. Carey,
one of the most politically
active among labor lead-
ers. Consequently, the com-
pany’s encouragement to
management to be more
active in civic and political
affairs and its effective
and informative means of
contact with union mem-
bers have incurred attack
in the labor press and in
the speeches of Carey and
others. Since attacks of this
kind are usually empha-
sized by epithets, an ef-
fort has been made to
create “Boulwarism” as a
term of reproach.
Perhaps it is on account
of that sort of propaganda
that an account of a change
in company status by Boul-
ware was made the sub-
ject of a badly distorted
story in the New York
Times.
The inference conveyed
in that story was that Boul-
ware had suddenly been re-
lieved of his operating re-
sponsibility and that the
policies with which his
name is associated have in
some way been repudiated
by General Electric. The
president of the company,
R. J. Cordiner, immediate-
ly addressed a letter to the
Times, which was pub-
lished the next day.
Cordiner hastened to as-
sert that Boulware had, in
fact, been appointed as a
consultant, with the reten-
tion of his title of vice-
president and member of
the executive office of the
company. A younger man
had been appointed to take
over the operating activ-
ities of the Boulware office.
This, said Cordiner, was
in line with the policy of
the company to relieve top
officers somewhat before
their stated year of retire-
ment to permit them to
break in their successors
and to make sure that es-
tablished policies would be
continued. Boulware is
now 62 and will, according
to the company’s rule, re-
tire three years hence.
Cordiner said in his let-
ter: “We are convinced that
the policies under Mr.
Boulware’s leadership are
in the mutual best interest
of General Electric em-
ployees, shareholders, cus-
tomers, suppliers, dealers,
and the public at large…
The purpose of the move
is to assure continuity of
the policies and approaches
pioneered by Mr. Boul-
ware.”
It is well that the impli-
cations of the newspaper
account have thus been re-
pudiated, for it is of great
importance to industry
generally and to the
healthy operation of the
political life of the nation
that such policies be con-
tinued and perhaps be
copied by other companies.
For unless management
offers such leadership
there is real danger that
the powerful political op-
erations of certain unions
will achieve an undue con-
trol of government in the
States and in the nation.
A strong and wholesome
political system is one in
which all interests are tak-
ing an active part.
