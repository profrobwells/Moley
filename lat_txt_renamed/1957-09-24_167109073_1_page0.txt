TUGWELL'S
F.D.R.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No historian of the
New Deal years has at-
tempted to deny that the
grand strategy of Presi-
dent Roosevelt underwent
a profound change in the
years 1935, 1936 and 1937.
The earlier Roosevelt,
as a candidate in 1932 and
in the formative years of
his administration, based
his hope of returning
prosperity on the recov-
ery of the purchasing
power of agriculture by
inflationary measures, on
such subsidized innova-
tions as the TVA, the
great electric power in-
stallations in the North-
west, certain large public
works with Federal
money, and on enormous
subsidies for farmers.
But in the middle of
1935 his program switched
to the masses in the big
cities. There were the
Wagner Act to build up
political unionism in the
newly formed CIO, Social
Security, subsidized hous-
ing, and other measures.
It is possible now to piece
together the strategy be-
hind this change.

In an excessively long
and moody book, "The
Democratic Roosevelt,"
Rexford G. Tugwell re-
veals a good deal of the
private Roosevelt inten-
tions of those days. For
few people in that admin-
istration so persistently
lurked in the White
House shadow, and few
were able so successfully
to elicit from the Presi-
dent random bits of think-
ing which he used to call
his "hunches" and "brain-
storms."
Roosevelt, Tugwell
says, was a "Democrat of
convenience." He was tor-
mented by the necessity
of making compromises
with those conservative
Democrats who effectively
controlled and directed
the Democratic Party in
Congress.
But, Tugwell says,
Roosevelt in his heart
"saw no alternative, in
the long run, to creating
a new force." His "grand
conception" (a phrase
used repeatedly by Tug-
well) was a new "progres-
sive" party, and his cam-
paign of 1936 "was not so
much an election contest
as an appeal for ratifica-
tion of a progressivism
quite as much Republican
as Democratic."
*
This trend of Presiden-
tial thinking was eagerly
followed by four of the
intimates of those days,
Harry Hopkins, Robert
La Follette Jr., Fiorello
La Guardia and Tugwell.
However, despite the
tremendous victory of 1936,
Roosevelt soon realized
that the conservative core
of his party would at the
very least frustrate his at-
tempt to revamp the Dem-
ocratic Party and would
most certainly permit the
Republicans to overwhelm
such a jerry-built third
party as was envisioned by
Harry and Bob and Rex
and Fiorello. And Roose-
velt was unwilling to let
any reform, however vital,
and any conception, how-
ever grand, endanger his
continuous tenure of the
White House.
So the idea was set aside
when war broke out in Eu-
rope. But Tugwell is posi-
tive that after the war
"and when postwar inter-
national organization was
fully planned, he would re-
turn to his progressive
project."

Samuel I. Rosenman'
says in his book that Roo-
sevelt did propose in June,
1944, that Wendell Willkie
join him in creating a new
party in the midst of a war
and a Presidential cam-
paign. Willkie, according
to Rosenman, was willing
enough, but wanted to wait
until after the election.
Fate decreed that Willkie
would not live until the
election.
I cannot understand why
the Tugwell account
should be so sad, so remi-
niscent of lost opportuni-
ties, so expressive of a be-
lief that only Roosevelt
was capable of creating a
new party.
â€¢ If he would only look at
the Democratic Party to-
day he would see the
influences introduced by
Roosevelt in 1935 rapidly
coming into control.
