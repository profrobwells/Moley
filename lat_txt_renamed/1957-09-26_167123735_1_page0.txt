POLITICAL
NEGLECT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On every hand we en-
counter shocking neglect
of political responsibilities
by the very people who
have the most to contrib-
ute and who, incidentally,
have the most to lose by
the surrender of their con-
trol over the government
that makes and enforces
the law of the land.
Studies of the habits and
interests of college stu-
dents show a great indif-
ference to and, in fact, ig-
norance of political proc-
esses. An appalling num-
ber of middle and upper
income business and pro-
fessional people are likely
to be on the golf course on
primary and election days.
Even in a Presidential
year, only about two of
three eligible Americans
vote; and, in 1958, with the
control of Congress at
stake, I estimate that
about two of five eligibles
will register a choice.

In the recent by-election
in Wisconsin only about
half of the "normal" Re-
publican vote turned out,
and that "normal" vote has
been, as I have indicated
above, very considerably
less than the eligible vote.
It is true that much of the
abstinence in Wisconsin
was an expression by Re-
publicans of dissatisfac-
tion. But the abstainers, if
they really wanted to reg-
ister their displeasure,
should have voted for the
opposition. In short, they
should have voted.
Many people have tried
by exhortation to arouse
greater interest in politics.
Sincere and dedicated
teachers in colleges have
tried many methods to put
politics into competition
with the other interests of
their students. There are
many movements and or-
ganizations designed to
improve government
through greater citizen
participation in politics.
Much of this effort has
been wasted,
On one occasion I was
asked to express an opin-
ion why these appeals to
students and others on the
basis of duty have been so
unsatisfactory in their re-
sults.
I offered this suggestion:
"Why does boy marry
girl? Because it is his duty
to help propagate the race
or to build a nation of
homes instead of bache-
lors' quarters? Or because
religion teaches that it is
better to marry than burn?
No! He marries because
he finds a girl, without
whom he believes life
would be a dreary expanse
of nothing."
In short, the way to get
people interested in poli-
tics is not merely to talk
about duty or to tell peo-
ple that if they don't get
busy bad people will de-
stroy their government.
The way to get people into
politics is to show them
how interesting it is.

A little book by Robert
E. Merriam and Rachel M.
Goetz entitled "Going Into
Politics" (published by
Harper), measurably at-
tempts this method of per-
suasion. Merriam is a Chi-
cago Republican who
served in the Chicago City
Council and who ran un-
successfully for Mayor of
that city. Miss Goetz is a
Democrat who has been in
various political activities,
including the 1956 cam-
paign of Adlai Stevenson.
The authors have
amassed sufficient experi-
ence to provide some ex-
cellent and interesting sto-
ries about life among Chi-
cago politicians. They al-
so offer useful suggestions
about how to win votes
and voter interest legiti-
mately. As a means of
training volunteers, this
should be very helpful in
any political campaign.
And the point of view they
present avoids the aridity
of the mere municipal re-
former.

Despite the value of this
and many other books of
the sort, aimed at the good
but inert citizens, nothing
in print has yet ap-
proached the vividness and
hard-hitting realism of the
handbook produced by the
AFL-CIO Committee on
Political Education, a lit-
tle book named "How to
Win."
Until conservatives put
into campaigns for their
candidates not only some
of the skilled professional-
ism shown in that hand-
book but competence in
the actual process of get-
ting out the vote, there
will be many more Wis-
consins.
