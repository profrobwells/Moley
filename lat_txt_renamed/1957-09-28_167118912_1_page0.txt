RAYMOND MOLEY:
Comptroller General
Is Taxpayers' Sentinel
Much government policy
is made through the methods used by agencies to
keep their accounts and to
provide for the public and
Congress a clear and genuinely honest picture of
what they are doing and in
what direction they are
going.
By a deceptive use of
figures, some agencies are
actually in the business of
pouring out public funds
in subsidies, while they
claim by doctored accounts that they are
actually running a self-
liquidating operation. As a
means of keeping a check
on this sort of thing, and
to see that all transactions
are money-honest and are
properly authorized by
Congress, a general accounting office was set up
in 1921, headed by an official called the Comptroller
General of the United
States.
*
This official was given
great powers and was
carefully protected from
outside influences, political and otherwise. His
term is 15 years and he
can be removed only by
impeachment or by joint
resolution of Congress for
specified cause. Thus, he is
protected from removal or
interference by the executive branch of the government and from the political
designs of any President.
He is, in fact, a part of
the legislative branch of
the government and makes
his reports to Congress.
He is the major agency by
which the Congress can
exercise its responsibility
for the spending of the
taxpayers' money.
His power to make investigations into executive
agencies is very great.
Either on his own initiative or, at the direction of
Congress, he can command
all departments to provide
information and can not
only report what an agency has been doing but can
make recommendations
for the future.
However, as the first Hoover Commission reported in 1949, the Comptroller General up to that
time had permitted their
offices to be so utterly submerged in the job of more
or less routine checking on
millions of individual
transactions that the more
constructive responsibility
of specific investigations
was pushed aside.
*
In response to the Hoover recommendations, an
act was passed in 1950,
which assigned additional
duties to the Comptroller
General and measurably
cleared the way for an internal reorganization of
the general accounting office.
But it has remained for
the present Comptroller
General, Joseph Campbell,
to take steps toward making the investigative functions of the office a real
force in the administration of government. His
report on the military aid
program has attracted
wide attention in Congress
and in the press. His successive reports on TVA
have been constructive
and helpful to friends of
economy and free enterprise. A massive report on
the Missouri River Basin
water resources development program has brought
light into an area long
darkened by strange and
doubtful estimates and
projections.
*
The efforts of Campbell
to improve his great office
have been greatly helped
and encouraged by a report last year on that
office by the House Committee on Government Operations, a report largely
credited to Reps. William
I. Dawson of Illinois and
Glenard P. Lipscomb of
California.
Under the leadership of
the present Comptroller
General, the investigative
arm of his office may become substantially a continuing Hoover Commission. This should save a
great deal of taxpayers'
money and provide a
wholesome check on the
growth of big and social-
ized government.
