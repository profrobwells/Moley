BAYONET
ACTION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Unless all the sources
available to me as a writer
are mighty deceiving, the
President's action in the
Little Rock crisis has almost
universal opposition in the
South and, outside a few
places like New York City,
rather meager approval in
the North. Many times
since the Supreme Court's
decision I have expressed
strong criticism of Chief
Justice Warren's opinion. He
cited thoroughly bad
sociological and psychological
writings to justify his conclusion,
and also he failed to state
in 1954 a way of implementing
the decision through the
Federal courts in the South
which was known to him at
that time, but which he
belatedly stated after a
whole year of confusion.

There is also the personally
gathered evidence which has
come in conversations in
many States from coast to
coast. This is not 1860,
when—because of the shoutings
of politicians over many years,
and the fact of slavery, and
undeniably bad conditions in
many parts of the South—the
North was measurably,
although not unanimously,
opposed to the ideas and
assertions of southern representatives.
This is 1957, when the
South is generally the most
rapidly growing part of the
nation, when the southern
Negro is enjoying real economic
progress and when, because
of the tremendous growth of
Federal power, the North itself
is alarmed at the decline in
the rights and privileges of
the States. Certainly the
President must have had prejudiced
and superficial advice, not
only in prompting him to act
when and as he did, but in
making a case for himself in
his speech over the air. His
haste in using the ultimate
weapon was due to an added
conviction, perhaps inspired
from the same source, that
violence of such a serious
nature was so imminent that
immediate action was essential.
There will be dispute about
that for a long time to come.
At any rate, the action was
precipitate and is certain to
have repercussions for years
to come.

★

A precedent has been set
which may provoke incidents
in areas much more critical
than Little Rock. One responsible
southern leader with whom
I have spoken pointed out
that serious resistance to a
court order might well take
place in a semi-rural county
in some other State or in a
small and incompetently policed
city. Is Federal military force
to be used in every such case?
Will any such repetition of
this use of force be conducive
to more unrest and more
disorder? Perhaps the President
believed that one such display
is enough. That is a matter
for grave doubt. Incidental
questions present themselves.
Were bayonets necessary in
this case?

If, as the President says, a
considerable part of his concern
was the effect of the incident
abroad, will not pictures of
this blitz provide wonderful
Communist propaganda at a
moment when we are denouncing
the Soviet's crushing of the
revolt in Hungary?

★

Speculations as to what the
political outcome may be are
at this time decidedly out of
order. But it can clearly be
charged that a long series of
statements, speeches and actions—running
back to the 1954 decision—by
the President's colleagues prove
that political capital has been
made or attempted to be made
out of this segregation issue.
It is too late to undo the harm
that such indefensible vote-hunting
has done. But it should at
least be a warning to the
President's advisers that the
man in the White House is not
merely the head of a party
and the guarantee of their
continuance in their jobs for
three more years, but that he
is, above all, the President
of the nation, whose greatest
responsibility is to preserve
"a more perfect union" among
all its States and sections.
