RAYMOND MOLEY:
Trade Associations
Face New Challenge
At a moment when
businessmen are complaining, with good reasons, about the power of
the large international unions, they might well take
note of what is happening
to a great many of their
own nationwide trade and
business organizations.
For a great many of the
latter are having real
troubles in keeping up
their membership, and
still more trouble in getting
members interested
in specific problems which
concern their groups as a
whole.
An experienced trade
association executive has
recently made some very
keen observations about
this problem, which concerns him vitally as an
employee and as a man
who has given the best
years of his life to the collective interests of his industry.
*
One of his observations
is that manufacturers and
distributors are now making and dealing in so
many things that were not
in their sphere of interest
20 years ago. The automotive industry, he cites,
still makes automobiles.
But it also makes furnaces, air conditioning,
refrigerators, locomotives,
TV sets and a dozen or two
of the things which go
into the defense activities
of the government, including missiles.
He pointed out that the
trade associations’ original
activities included trade
shows, meetings and conventions designed to foster
good interindustry relations, common fellowship and refreshment, and
to exchange ideas of interest to all.
*
Perhaps the immense
government business enjoyed by so many companies has dulled their interest in the purely competitive side of their concerns.
The trade association
executive of whom I speak
says also that the old individual leaders of the industry who were active in
association work and
largely determined policy
have moved over the age
horizon, and a new and
different sort have come
into power in the companies.
When I read this comment, I thought of William
H. Whyte Jr.’s excellent
book, "The Organization
Man," and wondered
whether the new organization man is, after all, a
very good organizer. He
identifies himself with a
mass—usually the big
company he works for—
but he has had no hand in
making and precious little
in the running of the organization of which he is
a part.
The National Trade Association is confronted
with new problems in a
new context—problems for
which neither the company officers nor the executives of the association
have solutions, and, moreover, problems which they
are only beginning to understand.
One big example I might
mention is the relation of
business to Congress and
the State Legislatures. The
old-fashioned lobby is
pretty ineffective now.
When an industry or a
company appears before a
Congressional committee
or confers with a legislator, it is not taken so seriously as it used to be. The
legislator realizes that
with the immense growth
of the political power of
labor unions, the level of
influence is local, not national.
*
The unions have their
lobby, as always. But they
are seeing to it that they
shall have a hand in electing the lawmakers in the
local districts. The battle-
ground is fundamentally
local, not national.
This brings up two pertinent observations. The
first is that local Chambers of Commerce and other
groups of businesses
become more important in
the education and direction of businessmen’s efforts toward the serving
of their vital interests.
And, also, the companies
themselves will to a greater and greater degree,
through their own public
affairs directors or public
relations people, serve the
interests hitherto left to
national associations.
The transition to the
new order of things may
be slow and to a degree
painful but if ever there
was needed leadership by
company executives themselves it is now. For they
must re-create the means
for their survival in an age
when the very postulates
of economic freedom are
being challenged on every
side.
