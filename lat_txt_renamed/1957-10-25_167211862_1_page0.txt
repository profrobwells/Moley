Sen. Mike Mansfield of
Montana occasionally
makes observations which
lift him above the average
vote-hunting gentry in
public life.
Speaking as a chairman
of the Democratic Nation-
al Committee, he recently
issued a statement in reply
to a claim by Republican
Chairman Meade Alcorn
that the Republican Party
would gain by the crisis
over Little Rock "whether
anyone exploits it or not."
Mansfield answered that
neither party would benefit.
Perhaps Alcorn meant
to suggest to Republicans
that they make no effort
to exploit the unfortunate
display of bayonets. If so,
he was on sound ground
morally and politically.

Republicans generally
need such a warning, because
there are plenty of
them who are trying to exploit
the matter. Perhaps
the grim outlook which
Republicans face next year
inspires this effort to win
votes by an event which
has awakened passions
which we believed to have
been stilled, and a course
of action which has probably
lost the President a
million friends in the
South.
Only recently a very
prominent Republican, not
now in office, said heatedly
that the Attorney General
had to get a judge from
North Dakota in order to
get the kind of order that
"we" wanted. This suggests
a most unfortunate
interference with the
courts by the Executive.
At the Lincoln Day dinner
in New York in 1955 the
main speaker shouted that
another emancipation had
come because of a "great
Republican Chief Justice."
Good Republican constitutionalists
squirmed in
their seats at this claim
for party credit because of
a decision rendered by a
court, eight members of
which were appointed by
Democratic Presidents.

Last week another highly
publicized Republican,
Clare Boothe Luce, former
Ambassador to Italy, used
her place on the program
at a dinner devoted to
charitable purposes to
make a demagogic attack
upon the South. It was a
$100-a-plate dinner in
memory of a great Democrat
and American, Alfred
E. Smith, to raise money
for St. Vincent's Hospital
in New York. Cardinal
Spellman was the most notable
of the speakers.
Mrs. Luce said, in part:
"The people of the
world . . . in these last
weeks . . . have seen men
—white men—burn a Negro
in effigy. They have
seen men—white men—
strike children because
their skins were dark . . .
and seeing they have understood
that there are
hearts in America which
seethe with racial hatred
. . . Will Germans not ask
if this is the same America
which condemned so fiercely
the gas chambers of
Auschwitz? . . . We implore
our southern neighbors
. . . if they will not lift
their eyes to the highest
heaven, at least lift them
as high as the Sputnik."
Later in the speech she
attempted to share the
responsibility for our lag
in space navigation with
the Democrats. She noted
that there had been "six
Democratic and six Republican
years since Hiroshima."
Then she pleaded
that in the missile-satellite
failure there be no "partisan
recrimination."
*
The shade of the man
in whose memory the dinner
was held must have
dropped his head in regret
at this affront to millions
of good Americans. For Al
Smith said on one occasion,
after a speech by
Franklin D. Roosevelt:
"I will take off my coat
and vest and fight to the
end any candidate who
persists in a demagogic appeal—setting
class against
class."
It is not without importance
that notable Democrats
in New York, who attended
the dinner in the
belief that politics would
be adjourned, have expressed
their indignation
at Mrs. Luce's blatant waving
of the bloody shirt a
generation after that deplorable
practice had been
consigned to oblivion.
