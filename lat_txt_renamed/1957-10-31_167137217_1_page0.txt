Southerners' Threat
to Democratic Party
The statement of prin-
ciples of the Democratic
Advisory Council is a
strange jumble of com-
plaining double talk. If it
were not for the self-in-
flicted wounds from which
the Eisenhower adminis-
tration is suffering, this
demonstration of Demo-
cratic weakness would seal
the party's fate in the 1958
election: For what is re-
vealed is the hopeless im-
passe into which events
have projected the north-
ern "liberal" Democrats.
Let us take a long, close
look at exactly what the
dominant element in the
party really is. It is a group
of officeholders, mostly
Governors and members
of Congress, who, while
extremely articulate, have
little in the way of solid,
substantial Democratic po-
litical machinery behind
them. These are typified
by such Senators as Doug-
las, Humphrey, Morse, Ke-
fauver and Neuberger,
and such Governors as
Leader and Harriman,
and quite a number of
members of the House of
Representatives. Then
there are a few newcomers
like Sens. Clark, Carroll,
Yarborough and Proxmire.

In none of the States in
which these have been
elected are there strong
machines of a genuine
Democratic character. For
the most part, the old city
machines are no longer
potent. Such money as is
available for politics is
mostly Republican. And
with the exception of la-
bor unions, there are no
private organizations of
real political strength.
Moreover, the loss of the
Presidency has denied
these people the Federal
patronage which can keep
an organization efficient
and happy.
Most of the aforemen-
tioned jobholders are deep-
ly indebted to the Reuther-
Meany political machine
and to union money and
manpower for their.suc-
cess at the polls. So far as
personal individual power
is concerned, they have
nothing but their oratory
and the prestige of their
public office.
No national Democratic
Party can subsist upon that
sort of support. For years
the national party has
been dependent upon the
safe South to win nation-
al elections.
And now, because of the
sharpened crisis over seg-
regation, there is an excel-
lent chance that from five
to seven States will in sub-
stance declare their inde-
pendence from the nation-
al Democratic Party. The
five States to which I refer
are South Carolina, Geor-
gia, Alabama, Virginia
and Mississippi. These
may be joined by Louisi-
ana, Arkansas, and pos-
sibly by North Carolina
and Texas.

For the purpose of elect-
ing State officers and mem-
bers of Congress, these
States will remain Dem-
ocratic in name. But unless
things change a great deal
before 1960, it is likely that
these States will withhold
their electoral votes from
any ticket nominated at a
national Democratic con-
vention, and any platform
adopted there.
That will leave only one
hard and efficient base of
support for northern lib-
eral democracy-the AFL-
CIO Committee on Political
Education. This means the
political machines sup-
ported by the money and
manpower controlled by
Walter Reuther and oth-
ers. Thus, the defection of
the South throws the na-
tional Democratic Party
squarely into the hands of
the political leaders of the
unions. Since that is likely
to be true, the Democratic
Party substantially be-
comes a labor party over
all of the nation outside
the South.
Perhaps this will be the
most significant of all the
results of the segregation
crisis. It may well mean
that this issue will sound
the doom of two-party gov-
ernment,
