RAYMOND MOLEY:
New York Has Own
Integration Problems
I have lived in New York
for a good many years and
one of the things that has
always intrigued me is
the fact that leaders of
thought in this city—
which is perpetually sunk
in a mess of social, eco-
nomic and political prob-
lems—are so free to tell
the rest of the country
and, in fact, the rest of
the world, how to solve
their problems.
There is no group so
vociferous in discussing
racial problems as certain
members of the faculty of
Columbia University. But
it is unsafe for decent peo-
ple to walk in the streets
in the vicinity of the cam-
pus after nightfall.

Over the last two months
the New York Times has
been lecturing the South
about its segregated
schools. But now in a
long article by the Times
education editor there are
revealed school problems
in New York City that
dwarf those faced by
almost every city in the
South.
In the first place, in
spite of the fact that the
Catholic Church has
relieved the city of the
expense and trouble of
educating more than 100,-
000, or about 15%, of the
city's children of school
age, and in spite of the
fact that thousands of New
York children are going to
private schools, the city's
physical school plant is
lamentably bad. The con-
trast between some of the
ramshackle buildings in
Harlem and the fine new
Negro schools in some
parts of the South is strik-
ing.

But the energies of re-
form here are not directed
toward getting better
schools, but in forcing the
Negroes, Puerto Ricans
and white children into
the same schools by every
means possible. Under
the incessant prodding of
certain organized minori-
ty groups, this is sought in
all sorts of artificial ways.
One is to carry pupils in
buses long distances from
Negro and Puerto Rican
neighborhoods. Another is
to redraw the boundaries
of the school districts.
The administrative prob-
lems in providing educa-
tional facilities for such a
mixed school population
are terrific. There are
many schools where the
percentage of white chil-
dren is negligible or non-
existent. There is a short-
age of qualified Negro
teachers for these schools.
Because of that, and be-
cause of the pressure to
have white teachers on in-
tegrationist grounds, great
efforts are made to get
white teachers to volun-
teer to move into those
schools. This is not easy.
★
This September, 1200
teachers were needed for
all-Negro or Puerto Rican
schools. Volunteers were
called for, and only 25
came forward. Concerning
this, the "liberal" New
York Times says:
"School officials are just
about convinced that they
will have to draft teachers
for difficult schools."
Just what is meant by
"draft" is not explained.
It ought to be explained
here that the problem of
integration is much more
difficult in the case of ele-
mentary and junior high
schools than in high
schools. The ratio of the
races in the former is 2
to 1, in the latter 6 to 1.
It goes without saying
that the Puerto Ricans,
who provide more than
100,000 school children,
constitute an added prob-
lem—the difficulty of
language.
★
In addition, the prob-
lem of difficult and defec-
tive children is most se-
rious. Another newspaper
reported just last week
examples of indescribably
careless work on the part
of certain social and psy-
chiatric workers charged
with supervision of defec-
tive children. In one case
the result of this careless-
ness was an attack by one
boy on another with lye as
the weapon.
It will be said, of course,
that there are still all-Ne-
gro or Puerto Rican
schools because there are
still segregated neighbor-
hoods. To "correct" this,
there is pending the so-
called Sharkey bill de-
signed to deny private
landlords the right to
choose their tenants. Thus,
forced school integration
can take place only after
there is forced integration
of residences. The passage
of this bill by the City
Council is probable after
the election. And it will
certainly be a bonanza for
lawyers, if it affords no
benefit to anyone else.
This is New York, the
home of those who would
reform the South.
