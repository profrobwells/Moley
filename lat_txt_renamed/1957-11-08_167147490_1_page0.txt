INSTABILITY IN THE KREMLIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The day after the news
of Zhukov's removal as
Defense Minister was pub-
lished I met a man who
is known nationally and
whom I would rate high-
er than any of the other
experts on Soviet affairs.
I asked his opinion as to
the significance of this
piece of news to the peo-
ple of the United States,
He said the incident
would lead to another
"spirit of Geneva." He ex-
plained that he does not
agree with the belief, ex-
pressed by some commen-
tators, that when things
are unstable in the Krem-
lin Soviet foreign policy
becomes tougher. He said
that the opposite happens.
This view seems to be
supported by the quieting
down of the crisis in the
Middle East in the past
few days.

It was also significant,
my friend continued, that
after Zhukov and Khru-
shchev appeared at a cock-
tail affair at the Turkish
Embassy in a good-
humored state and, after
plenty of champagne, they
talked freely of peace, love
and good relations. This
was on the very heels of
dire threats against Tur-
key.
The whole crude affair
over Zhukov demonstrat-
ed unstable conditions in
the inner councils of the
party. Why mar the fair
publicity over the Sput-
niks with news of internal
strife? Why make the
change on the very eve of
Mau's visit and the cele-
bration of Nov. 7? There is
no answer to these ques-
tions except to say that
Khrushchev must have
been genuinely afraid lest
there be another sort of
celebration on the sinister
Bolshevik anniversary. In
short, Zhukov may have
been planning a coup of
his own.
â˜…
Even the Truman re-
moval of Gen. MacArthur
lacked the crudity of this
downgrading of the fore-
most military figure in
Russia. The aftermath of
the MacArthur removal,
with a grateful nation
pouring out to honor a
great hero, shows how
deeply a military hero is
respected by the people in
general.
The ridiculous "confes-
sion" of Zhukov is evi-
dence that this single
move has not closed the
matter or allayed the fear
that inspired it. For Zhu-
kov confessed no real
wrongdoing, no plotting
against the government,
no treason to the state. He
merely said he had lacked
understanding of political
affairs and that he had
learned a great deal from
the meeting at which he
was attacked by the poli-
ticians in the Central Com-
mittee.
*
This we must under-
stand as routine prevarica-
tion under pressure to
save his life. Or the words
attributed to Zhukov may
have been an invention of
the ruling group. At any
rate, the politicians dared
to go only part way.
The instability of the
Kremlin points up another
hard fact. Communism
may perform immense sci-
entific feats. It can com-
mand success in material
science. But, its efforts to
master the immaterial
world of human nature are
still futile. Thought con-
trol and brainwashing
may register temporary
and partial victories. But
human beings and their
behavior are still immune
from scientific measure-
ment. The men in the
Kremlin are still timid
creatures, all too aware of
their insubstantial author-
ity over the minds of the
Russian people, who in the
long run will prevail.
