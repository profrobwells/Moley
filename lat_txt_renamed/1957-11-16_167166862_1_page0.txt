RAYMOND MOLEY:
Implications of UAW
Political Fund Case
The case against the
United Auto Workers for
expenditures for television
time in a campaign for
members of Congress was
terminated by an acquit-
tal. This raises some in-
teresting questions con-
cerning the future of the
politically minded labor
unions in politics.
In the Detroit case the
judge's instructions are
subject to serious criti-
cism, just as was his de-
cision in 1955 that no law
was violated. The expla-
nations by some of the
jurors of their reasons for
acquittal were wholly be-
side the point. Perhaps, as
the United States attorney
said after the acquittal,
the law in this case may
be a dead letter. The case,
however, throws a good
deal of light concerning
the nature and ultimate
objectives of the UAW
and other politically dedi-
cated unions.
★
The argument before
the Supreme Court on this
case, which ended in the
reinstatement of the in-
dictment, is far more re-
vealing than anything
that transpired in the De-
troit trial. For Mr. Jus-
tice Frankfurter pursued a
former student and UAW
lawyer, Joseph L. Rauh
Jr., with a series of ex-
ceedingly searching ques-
tions.
One of them was wheth-
er there was any differ-
ence between a corpora-
tion spending its money
"in connection with a
Federal election" on po-
litical propaganda and a
labor organization's doing
so.
Rauh's answer was a
weakly qualified negative.
In fact, it seems to be the
settled policy of Reuther
and other spokesmen for
the UAW that, since they
consider the law to be un-
constitutional because it
is a limitation on freedom
of speech, they cannot
seriously object to the
use of corporation money
for political activities.
Their determination at
all costs is to use the dues
of members not only for
the legitimate purposes of
bargaining but for poli-
tics. "One cannot draw a
line," said Rauh, "be-
tween bargaining and
politics."
★
Fundamentally, this
means that they intend to
mobilize great power to
create State and Federal
governments which are
subject to their pressure
and direction. They intend
to do this by the use of
union employees and of
union money paid out of
the union treasury.
This sort of money can-
not be raised by voluntary
subscriptions. Rauh ad-
mitted this in answer to a
question by Mr. Justice
Reed. He said that all the
money they raised by vol-
untary means went in di-
rect contributions to can-
didates.
He added: "Well, sir, a
union man thinks he has
paid, when he has paid his
dues, he thinks he has
paid for bargaining, for
legislation and for po-
litical activity. He doesn't
feel that he should pay a
second time for political
activity."
★
If Rauh were perfect-
ly frank he would admit
that union members—be-
ing citizens of their com-
munities, of their State
and of the nation as well
as workers—would prefer
to keep their political deci-
sions, their political activ-
ity and their voting right
in their own possession.
But since the payment of
dues is compulsory, they
are dependent upon the
union for their jobs and
livelihood.
This demonstrates clear-
ly that the root of these
unions' immense and
growing political power is
the union shop.
The right to work is in-
separable from the right
to exercise the responsi-
bilities of citizenship with-
out dictation.
