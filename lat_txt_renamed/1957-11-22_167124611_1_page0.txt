ECONOMY SNIPING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At a convention of the
National Reclamation As-
sociation this month a
committee of that body
presented a proposal to be
pressed in the next session
of Congress for a so-called
"basin account" for the
Pacific Northwest.
This subject, which at
least has no active opposi-
tion from the Eisenhower
Interior Department and
Bureau of Reclamation,
was proposed at almost the
same moment that the
President, seeking to re-
assure an anxious country
about its defense program,
said that there should be
substantial savings in civil
expenditures. He went on
to say that not only should
existing programs be
shaved, but that some pro-
grams as a whole might
have to be sacrificed in the
interest of national safety.
*
Let us look at this basin
account proposal for what
it is.
For a good many years
it has been evident that
the opening of new irriga-
tion projects in the recla-
mation States would in-
volve Federal expendi-
tures far in excess of the
ability of those farmers
who moved into them to
repay. Therefore, the In-
terior Department, both in
the Roosevelt-Truman
double decade and in the
Eisenhower era, has been
coming up with slick book-
keeping devices to get sub-
sidies for these undertak-
ings.
Most of these devices
were to use the alleged
profits from hydroelectric
projects to pay the neces-
sary subsidy to irrigation.
The Ickes Interior Depart-
ment claimed the legality
of taking out of the power
revenues the so-called in-
terest component to pay
for irrigation costs.
*
The law requires that
hydroelectric projects are
to be self-liquidating-i.e.,
that within a given time
the costs, with interest,
should be repaid to the
Treasury. However, it is
obvious that if the interest
which should be paid back
to the Treasury were to be
used for another purpose,
that charge would have to
be made up by the taxpay-
ers of the nation-taxpay-
ers who in the great ma-
jority would derive no
benefit from the projects.
Congress never author-
ized this scheme, although
the Interior Department
has been getting away
with it on a number of
projects ever since.
Then another device was
created, called the Collbran
formula. A modification of
this was incorporated in
the great Upper Colorado
Project which the White
House strong-armed
through Congress. This
fantastic plan provided
that the power projects
should be paid off in full,
with interest, then, after
that happy day some 50
years hence, the revenues
of those power projects
should pay off the costs of
raising hay and feed on
the high plateaus and
mountain valleys of the
arid West.
But since these irriga-
tion projects have been in-
trinsically subsidized from
the beginning because they
are interest free, the
amount of government out-
lay upon them would be so
big in 50 years that they
would not really be paid
off for a century or more,
if ever.
Meanwhile, the govern-
ment has continued to pay
subsidies for excess pro-
duction in other agricul-
tural regions. Thus, we are
paying to put land into
production in' some places
wh
while we are paying to
take land out of production
in others.
*
And. now comes the
"basin account" trick. It
was frankly recognized
both in the appeals of the
idea at the National Recla-
mation Association and by
Sen. Neuberger, who intro-
duced a bill last February
to create such an account
that irrigation projects
could never pay out in the
appointed 50 years, and
that they would have to be
subsidized by power rev-
enues.
The device to hide this
subsidy would be to put all
the revenues from a whole
river basin in one pot and
pay out of that all costs,
including the subsidy on
irrigation. According to an
Associated Press story,
Secretary Seaton "has ap-
proved the basin account
principle on several occa-
sions." It would seem,
therefore, that the Presi-
dent might have a talk
concerning his economy
idea with his Secretary of
the Interior on the first
possible occasion.
