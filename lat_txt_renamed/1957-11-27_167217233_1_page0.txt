RAYMOND MOLEY:
Why We're Behind in
Scientific Training
In a fine and penetrat-
ing talk to his professional
brethren in engineering,
Herbert Hoover has point-
ed a perceptive finger at
a major reason why we
are so far behind the So-
viets in certain aspects of
scientific training. Mr.
Hoover said:
"The origin of this de-
ficiency is well indicated
by a careful sampling
taken not too long ago,
which showed that under
12% of the high school
students were being
taught the elements of
algebra and geometry;
something under 9% were
being taught elementary
chemistry, and under 5%
were being taught elemen-
tary physics."
*
This neglect of the phys-
ical sciences has gone on
with an enormous expan-
sion of attention to the
so-called social sciences.
That emphasis in the high
schools has to a degree
been caused by a neglect
in higher education which
began nearly a generation
ago. For the college stu-
dents of today determine
in large part what sort of
thing will be taught in
high schools.
All this began after the
late 1910s and the 1920s,
when our institutions of
higher education and also
our foundations put im-
mense stress on the so-
called social sciences or,
as the nonnatural sciences
are sometimes called, the
behavioral sciences. A
great hullabaloo was
raised then about making
the study of sociology,
economics, and, in the
classical sense, politics,
truly "scientific." The
study of mankind was to
supersede the study of the
physical work in which
man had been plodding out
his appointed years.
The objective of most of
this, especially in what
was called "political sci-
ence," was to create better
government and bring
about world peace. It may
be a bit harsh to call at-
tention to the fact that
after some years we had
the greatest war in his-
tory and are entertaining
the hottest of cold wars,
apparently indefinitely.
The foundations rushed
in, and a study of the 1956
reports of the Rockefeller
and Ford Foundations in-
dicates the stress that still
prevails.
About a third of the
Rockefeller income went
for "social sciences" and
the "humanities," while
most of the rest pursued
the traditional Rockefeller
interest in biological and
medical science and in
agriculture.
Aside from the immense
grants by the Ford Foun-
dation to colleges, medical
schools and hospitals,
which came mostly out of
capital, a large part of the
real income of the founda-
tion went to "internation-
al" programs, the "behav-
ioral sciences," "educa-
tion," "public affairs,"
"economic development"
and "administration."
*
And it goes without say-
ing that this stress upon
"social science" and the
obvious slighting of en-
gineering and physics will
have great influence on
what the colleges do with
the grants that Ford has
given them, presumably
without strings.
Perhaps the plumbing of
the inscrutable reasons
why people behave as they
do might wait until we
can be sure that people
will have a world to be-
have in.
The Soviets assume the
sufficiency of Communism.
But much of our social
science is devoted to a
leisurely study of whether
capitalism and free gov-
ernment are, after all,
worth saving. Meanwhile,
the Soviets are getting
ready to resolve the issue
by superior physical force.
