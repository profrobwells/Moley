RAYMOND MOLEY:
Political Disputes
Balk Union Mergers
Stunning results, which
caused little attention in
the election a month ago,
have prompted the New
Jersey State CIO to take
violent exception to the be-
havior of that State's
Federation of Labor hier-
archy.
The returns that flushed
the cheeks of CIO chief-
tains in New Jersey were
not those of the victorious
Gov. Robert Meyner, who
had not received the bless-
ing of the AFL, but those
that swept a long-standing
Republican two-thirds ma-
jority from the State As-
sembly and replaced it
with a two-thirds Demo-
cratic majority. Further-
more, in precinct after
precinct "labor's men" did
well. Vast efforts in po-
litical action, successful in
other parts of the country,
bore fruit in -New Jersey
this last November.
And so, whereas the CIO
and the AFL, two brawny
opponents, had been quiet-
ly scuffling for two years
over merger plans, after
the election the CIO felt
it had every reason to
make known its grievances
and felt confident that
its political action success
justified its move. The CIO
shrieked its outrage from
a convention in Atlantic
City. The shocking noise
carried up and down the
Delaware, across the State,
over the Jersey flats, and
echoed along the Hudson
Valley.
Denunciation of the
AFL by the CIO sounded
more like a blast from the
ruling elite of a one-party
State against "deviation-
ists" than words tailored
as friendly persuasion to
bring the State's largest
union organizations to-
gether. The New Jersey
State CIO enumerated the
reasons it had not been
able to get together with
the AFL. These included
the following accusations
against AFL "spokesmen":
*
They "have not shown
good faith in these merger
negotiations..." They
have "embarked on a
smear-and-slur campaign
that is not typical of dedi-
cated trade union leaders."
AFL spokesmen "have
permitted their judgment
to become warped by their
bitter personal hatreds."
"They have further
thrown roadblocks in the
path of the merger talks
while engaging in back-
alley maneuvering and
jockeying to gain control."
Most important, spokes-
men for the AFL "have in-
dicated their opposition to
and disdain for the State
CIO's successful programs
in political action."
*
There is the nub. New
Jersey AFL leaders have
never made a secret of the
fact that they feel the CIO
spends inordinate time
and money in politics. The
New Jersey AFL accepts
lobbying and bargaining
as traditional functions. In
more than a dozen States
AFL Readers share this
view and have not merged,
even though such influen-
tial AFL leaders as George
Meany and James McDev-
itt have become committed
to the CIO's kind of polit-
ical action.
In the weeks, especially
in the last days and hours,
before this last election
New Jersey CIO politi-
cians were concentrating
on getting out the Demo-
cratic vote. An experienced
labor reporter has told me
that the CIO vote drive
was every bit as efficient
as the methods of Boss
Hague in Jersey City
when he was at the height
of his power.
*
Registration was no cas-
ual matter. The local CIO
headquarters had lists of
voters, knew who was and
who was not registered,
and went after those who
were not. They turned
their meetings into little
more than political ral-
lies. They saw that the
Democratic vote got to the
polls in a final dawn-to-
dark stint.
Following the recent
CIO attack, AFL leaders
voted unanimously to
maintain their independ-
ence. It is expected that
this impasse may go on
for another two years. And
in States like New Jersey,
where CIO and AFL
strength is approximately
equal, where neither has
an overpowering edge,
similar differences of view
may block merger of the
two giants on the State
level.
