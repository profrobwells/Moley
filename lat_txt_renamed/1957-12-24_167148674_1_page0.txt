Plans seem to be under
way to get the Kefauver
business-baiting show on
the road early in the year.
Sen. John M. Butler of
Maryland, in a speech in
Baltimore on Dec. 11,
pointed out that a pro-
posed plan of the Anti-
monopoly Subcommit-
tee chairman would in it-
self tend to force compa-
nies to violate the anti-
trust laws already on the
books.
The subject seems to
have originated in the pro-
posal made some months
ago by Walter Reuther of
the CIO-UAW, that the au-
tomobile companies reduce
the prices on their 1958
models $100 a car.
According to Sen. But-
ler, Chairman Kefauver on
Nov. 7 addressed an iden-
tical letter to General Mo-
tors, Ford, Chrysler and
the United Automobile
Workers. It said in part:
*
"Members of the sub-
committee unanimous-
ly decided that although
Mr. Reuther's offer was
rather vague and indef-
inite, the opportunity
should not be passed with-
out having Mr. Reuther
and the 'big three' manu-
facturers of automobiles
brought together, with the
hope of arriving at a bet-
ter understanding of the
issues involved in a firm
hold-the-line wage and
price formula. To this
same hearing will be in-
vited simultaneously Mr.
Walter Reuther, as well as
representatives of the
three companies. The first
witness heard will be Mr.
Reuther."
Sen. Dirksen, a member
of the subcommittee, im-
mediately challenged not
only the claim of a "unan-
imous decision," but the
strange and indefensible
idea that a Congressional
subcommittee should pre-
sume to operate as a
price-fixing or "price-un-
derstanding" agent. Such
an operation would, ac-
cording to Dirksen, be
"clearly beyond the scope
of the committee."
It would seem that the
Dirksen comment is an un-
derstatement. For such an
effort is not only clearly
beyond the powers of Con-
gress but beyond the juris-
diction of any govern-
mental agency.
Butler pointed out also
that the manufacturers
would be required to pro-
duce detailed cost, price,
and profit data, the dis-
closure of which has "al-
ways been regarded as
confidential information"
among competitors in a
business.
It would also seem that
Kefauver is intent upon
supplying Reuther with
information which would
enable him to use the au-
thority of a Congressional
committee's hearings in
his bargaining with the
companies in 1958.
*
Whether the companies
will choose to challenge
contempt proceedings by
refusing such an invitation
and order is not yet
known. But it would seem
that such an order to meet
at a Congressional com-
mittee table to compare
hitherto confidential infor-
mation, in order to arrive
at a common decision con-
cerning prices in the entire
industry, is in itself a com-
mand to violate the law.
Butler pointed out fur-
ther that the strategy of
Kefauver may well be
based upon the advice of
the chief economist of his
subcommittee, Dr. John M.
Blair, author of a book in
1938 entitled "Seeds of De-
struction," which attempt-
ed to show that capitalism
could not meet certain
tests offered by Blair as
essential to its survival.
â˜…
The Democratic major-
ity in Congress has certain
grave responsibilities in
the coming session. These
might well take priority
over such an investigation
as this latest Kefauver pro-
posal. If there is monopoly
in any business, it is the
duty of Congress to reveal
it. But in such an investi-
gation there should be
equal attention to the mo-
nopolistic powers of cer-
tain unions like that head-
ed by Reuther.
