RAYMOND MOLEY:
â€¢ Federal Credits No
Panacea for Business
The success of Sputnik
and other ominous reports
of Soviet military progress
came upon us at the same
moment as signs of a re-
cession in business threw
their ominous shadow on
the year ahead.
This has not only accel-
erated plans for more de-
fense spending, but has
brought into vigorous ac-
tivity all the Keynesian
elements among the mem-
bers of the Federal admin-
istration's economic medi-
cine men.
*
In the inner circles of
the administration, there-
fore, a battle is about to be
staged over crash spend-
ing and lending, such as
was present in the early
months of 1954. At that
time the urgent demands
for more liberal financial
policies made by Harold
Stassen and others were
confronted by firm resist-
ance by. Treasury Secre-
tary Humphrey and Ar-
thur Burns, then chairman
of the President's Council
of Economic Advisers.
The wait-and-see group
won over the President, es-
pecially when unmistak-
able signs of natural busi-
ness recovery appeared. It
may well be that the re-
fusal of the President to
move quickly into an en-
larged program of compen-
satory spending itself gave
the necessary confidence
to private business, which
brought out more private
spending, and which
turned the tide.
*
This time, however, we
have a controlling majority
in Congress by a party
which is dedicated to
spending as a sure cure-a
party which claims that it
had the formula in the
1930s which ended the de-
pression. Also, there will
be terrific pressures from
all the government bu-
reaus and departments
which have their own axes
to grind and their own
pork to fry.
Only very strong execu-
tive leadership which, as
in 1954, relies upon confi-
dence in private invest-
ment and spending, can
win against these pres-
sures.
In this case, the chair-
man of the President's
Council of Economic Ad-
visers is not Arthur Burns,
but Raymond J. Saulnier,
an economist who was
closely associated with
Burns in the council and al-
so at Columbia University
and the National Bureau of
Economic Research. That
is what gives special im-
portance to a recent publi-
cation of the National Bu-
reau of Economic Re-
search, dealing with the
history of Federal experi-
ments with government-
supplied credit for various
housing and farm projects
in the 1930s.
*
The conclusion of this
massive, disinterested and
nonpolitical study is that
the extension of liberal
credit by government for
purposes for which private
credit was scanty was not
a successful method of
changing the business
cycle. It shows, according
to a review of the study by
George Shea in the Wall
Street Journal, that the in-
crease in home building
after World War II was
not so great, considering
all factors, as after World
War I when there was no
government help.
The report says that
Federal credit programs
provide no valid assump-
tion that if greatly en-
larged they would perform
an anticyclical operation:
"... If enlarged to the
point where it would take
the place of a large seg-
ment of the private credit
mechanism, it would al-
most surely begin to be-
have the way private
credit does, with borrow-
ers seeking and being
granted more credit in
good times than in bad."

These shattering side-
lights on the successes and
failures of government at-
tempts to regulate the ups
and downs of business are
accompanied by equally
shattering facts regarding
the effects of Federal hous-
ing credit. On this subject
the findings of the authors
speak for themselves.
