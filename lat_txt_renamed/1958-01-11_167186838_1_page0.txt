Californians Kept
Up on Lawmakers˙
I am not sure whether
any pollster has ever tried
to determine how many al-
legedly good and adult
American citizens know
the names of their Con-
gressmen or the number
and boundaries of their
Congressional districts. I
am, however, sure that the
percentage of ignorance
on the subject is appall-
ingly high. The statistics
show that in 1954 about
41,000,000 voted for candi-
dates for the House of
Representatives, while in
1956 about 61,700,000 vot-
ed for the Presidential
candidates. This is one
measure of the reason
why the Congressman is
a forgotten man or wom-
an.
It hardly needs to he
added that these Repre-
sentatives, relative stran-
gers to the people they
represent, vote our taxes,
spend our money, and in
hundreds of ways regu-
late our lives.
Some people in Califor-
nia decided two years ago
to do something about
this state of ignorance and
neglect. They organized
what is known as the Cal-
ifornia Congressional Rec-
ognition Project, Inc.
*
George C. S. Benson,
president of Claremont
Men's College, is the pres-
ident of the project. He
describes its purpose as
"a contribution
to
public recognition of the
services of California Rep-
resentatives in the House
of Representatives, and to
an improved understand-
ing by California citizens
of the contributions which
their Representatives
make to this work."
The work of this group
is financed by private con-
tributions, and the mem-
bers of its council are at-
torneys, corporation exec-
utives, a labor union offi-
cial, and others.
Each year it issues a re-
port on the record of Cal-
ifornia Congressmen in
the immediately preced-
ing session of Congress.
There is a review over-all
of what was done in that
session in Congress
which is of interest na-
tionally and of concern to
California specifically.
Then it tells of what the
California delegation of 30
did collectively and indi-
vidually.
There is no attempt to
evaluate the votes on the
basis of an appraisal of an
ideological viewpoint. Nor
is there any attempt, as
is the case in so many cit-
izens' organizations, to
make recommendations as
between candidates for of-
fice.
The most valuable part
of the report, however, is
the sketch of each mem-
ber, with information
about his district, its
boundaries, and character-
istics. Maps of the States
and more congested parts
of the States are added
which show the bounda-
ries of the districts.
With a wide distribu-
tion of its report, this proj-
ect can go far in throw-
ing real light into the po-
litical darkness in which
the citizen gropes.

The average Congress-
man's job is not an easy
or happy one. He must la-
bor in the nation's serv-
ice with increasingly com-
plex problems confronting
him in Washington, while
at the same time his po-
litical opponents and ene-
mies are busy at home un-
dermining his support.
Special interests are at
work, such as the AFL-
CIO committee on politi-
cal education, distributing
information in print, on
the air, and by word of
mouth — praising or con-
demning him solely on the
basis of his votes on spe-
cial interests. His means
of presenting his own case
are limited. Very few on
the home front bother to
counteract these special
interests. He must shift
for himself, and often he
succumbs to the tempta-
tion to vote according to
the dictates of the largest
and most aggressive mi-
nority.

A group like the Cali-
fornia Congressional Rec-
ognition Project can help
put his record before his
constituents in proper per-
spective. It can help im-
mensely, also, to encour-
age Congressmen to vote
with some assurance in
the national as contrasted
with the special interests
of their State or any mi-
nority group therein.
Here is a job, simple
and inexpensive, for pub-
lic-spirited people every-
where. There ought to be
dozens of these organiza-
tions over the nation.
