TEACHERS'
TAX BILL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From time to time I
have, in these articles, criti-
cized various schemes for
Federal aid to education,
and I believe with sound
reasons.
Most such grandiose
plans are the emanation
of school administrators,
"educationists" and the
powerful pressure organi-
zations which these school
politicians dominate.
My mail sometimes se-
verely takes me to task,
saying I am opposed to the
interests of "teachers." My
reply is that I made a
sharp distinction between
the "educator" and the
"teacher."
I myself was a teacher
for a good many years but
I never conceived myself
to be an "educator,"
especially an "education-
ist." The teachers have
grievances which are le-
gitimate but they enter-
tain illusions when they
think that these can be
rectified by Federal hand-
outs.

One legitimate griev-
ance is that they suffer in-
equality of treatment in
tax deductions compared
with members of other
trades and professions.
Sen. Charles E. Potter puts
it this way:
"Ballplayers and fire-
men deduct the cost of
uniforms and equipment.
Business executives dine
on pheasant and live in
fancy hotel suites, chalk-
ing it up to necessary ex-
pense. Theatrical people
even deduct the cost of a
pair of spangled tights.
Why, then, are we discrim-
inating against our under-
paid teachers when they
attempt to develop them-
selves professionally?"
In 1921 the Internal
Revenue Bureau ruled that
teachers in private schools
were not to deduct the
costs of furthering their
education or professional
interests. These costs, it
was held, were personal.
After 1940, when gov-
ernment employees were
subjected to the Federal
income tax, public school
teachers raised the same
question. There has been
a great deal of bickering
since, between the Nation-
al Education Association
and the Treasury. In 1950
a Virginia schoolteacher
brought suit for educa-
tional expenses disallowed
and won her case. The re-
sult was a ruling by the
Internal Revenue Bureau
saying:
★
"Summer school ex-
penses incurred by a pub-
lic school teacher in order
to maintain her position
are deductible as ordinary
and necessary business ex-
penses under Sec. 23 (Q)
(1) (A) of the Internal
Revenue Code (of 1939),
and such expenses may be
deducted in determining
adjusted gross income un-
der 22 (N) of the code."
The qualification in this,
"in order to maintain her
position," is obviously too
restrictive. And the NEA
has fought for further lib-
eralization in the adminis-
tration of the law.
In this Congress a bill
sponsored by Reps. King
and Jenkins (HR 4662)
would give teachers tax re-
lief by providing for a
$600 deduction for educa-
tional travel and other
purposes. This has seemed
fair even to those opposed
to Federal grants.
Teachers who could
qualify for this deduction
would find it a substantial
benefit. But its cost to the
Treasury is estimated to
be only somewhere be-
tween $15,000,000 and $23,-
000,000.
★
The Treasury says that
this bill is unnecessary
and that it would put
teachers in a privileged po-
sition with respect to
taxes. This is not a ten-
able argument. For it
would merely put into spe-
cific law for teachers an
advantage for them which
is commonplace for the
rest of us.
Certainly if dues for
swank clubs and meals at
fancy restaurants where
customers are cozened, al-
so trips to resorts where
between drinks people lis-
ten to dreary disquisitions
about their professions are
deductible, the teacher of
art ought to be allowed a
deduction, for a trip to
Italy, or a weary peda-
gogue who scorns the de-
lights of summer at the
shore to pursue the M.A.
in the heat of New York
deserves a break.
