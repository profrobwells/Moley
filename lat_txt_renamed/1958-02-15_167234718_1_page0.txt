RAYMOND MOLEY:
Economist Analyzes
Unions' New Power
In 1957 Roscoe Pound,
luminous legal scholar and
former dean of the Harvard
Law School, published a
penetrating study, "The
Legal Immunities of
Labor Unions." Now
comes a companion study,
"The Economic Analysis
of Labor Union Power," by
a Harvard economist, Prof.
Edward H. Chamberlin.
Both were published by
the American Enterprise
Association, a nonpartisan
research organization.
This analysis is needed
because the unions' headlong rush to power has
outraced the efforts of detached scholars to appraise
either its economic or political influence. Indeed,
most of the labor literature
we have is hopelessly inadequate for an appraisal
of present conditions.
Chamberlin deals with
the "folklore" on the subject. There is still the
"anachronism that labor is
down and deserving of
some special kind of public sympathy." That "special kind of sympathy"
was written into the Wagner Act specifically in 1935
when the historical injustices borne by labor were
fresh in memory. But since
the Wagner Act was
passed a new situation has
transpired in which union
power with the power of
government and the dominant political party openly
entered the field of collective bargaining and won
the war for the unions, especially the more powerful ones.
Chamberlin also points
out the widespread conviction, well nourished by
the union leaders, that the
interests of the unions and
of the public are identical.
That "what is good for labor is good for the United
States" is a concept similar to Charles Wilson's inadvertent remark before
he assumed the office of
Secretary of Defense.
Whereas Wilson's remark
received unfavorable press
notice, organized labor's
claims slip by.
The truth is, as Chamberlin points out, that
"there is nothing to the
argument to indicate why
union laborers any more
than anyone else should
be chosen to have the
agreeable privilege of
mysteriously spreading
prosperity... The interest of those who gain is
hardly to be identified
with the whole, if the
whole includes those who
lose."
The point has been
reached where unions
have more power to raise
prices than do businesses
through monopoly power.
Chamberlin warns that "it
is more than a possibility
that, especially with the
drive for industry-wide
conformity, much that is
vital to the competitive
character of our economy
and which is responsible
for its high efficiency will
be lost through a substantial invasion of the
management area by labor, and that the public
will awaken one day to find
that a degree of economic
control, which it would
never have tolerated in
the hands of businessmen,
has already passed into the
hands of someone else."
Abuses revealed by the
McClellan committee
should certainly spur Congress to enact remedial
legislation. But this is only the beginning, Chamberlin explains. Solutions
also require adequate recognition of just what the
"labor market" is and how
it relates to the product
market.
A general feeling of
helplessness in the face of
labor power must be dispelled and the aspects of
union power recognized.
"What is needed is a thoroughgoing survey of the
various avenues through
which the economic power
of unions (and of their
leaders) may be most effectively restrained." This
could lead to a cancellation
of certain undesirable legal immunities unions now
use with devastating advantage in ways large and
small.
