Congress, that valiant
protector of free competi-
tion, is presently facing
the tough decision whether
or not to permit an in-
novation in private enter-
prise to have the chance
offered it by the Federal
Communications Commis-
sion or to stifle this infant
in the delivery room.
The hue and cry which
promises to sound in the
halls of Congress and re-
verberate in the main
streets of America has to
do with pay TV or, as that
inimitable coiner of words,
Variety, has it, "Feevec."
Pay TV, after years of
controversy, has been
given a chance to prove its
merits by the FCC. After
hearing 73 volumes of
testimony, this body
granted a three-year trial
period in a limited number
of cities where there are
more than four "first-class"
channels.
Strong forces are clash-
ing in this controversy.
Opponents feel that pay
TV would be ruinous, that
it would eventually shoul-
der out "quality" pro-
grams on free-TV time and
that the American public
would thus be deprived of
"getting something for
nothing." Further, they
scorn the idea that pay TV
could succeed against the
attraction of first-class
plays, movies, opera and
certain sporting events.
Rep. Emanuel Celler,
Judiciary chairman, op-
poses pay TV. He says, "I
want to keep faith with the
American people. It is they
who own the air waves."
But the air is carrying
pay telephones, telegrams
and airplanes which are
not supported by advertis-
ing. His bill would provide
penalties up to $10,000 or
up to five years in prison
or both for charging to
watch TV. I wonder how
he failed to provide fines
for those who prefer to
pay.
Celler has had his proto-
types in history — those
who would legislate
against experimentation.
My grandfather was a
manufacturer of wooden
bowls but there is no rec-
ord that he ran to Con-
gress to prohibit tin dish-
pans. I note, however,
a news item that a coal
industry group wants Con-
gress to stop helping the
development of atomic
power for the production
of electricity.
The movie industry com-
plains that they are being
seriously hurt by the
showing of the flickering
remains of pre-1948 pic-
tures, but I don't believe
that they are asking Con-
gress to help. In fact, the
movie industry in the Will
Hays days stood like a
rock against advertiser-
sponsored movies — for
which we owe that indus-
try a debt of gratitude.
The arguments for a
trial of pay TV are mainly
that it would provide a
wider freedom of choice
for viewers. All sorts of
special features could be
seen by people who would
rather stay in the living
room than plod forth to a
theater or football field.
Better movies could be
shown, baseball and box-
ing fans could see what is
going on within the pres-
ent proscribed limit.
This would also be a
wholesome challenge to
advertising talent to pro-
vide a better sort of com-
mercial than some of those
that are now boring mil-
lions of Americans. These
creative people might hit
upon more things like the
mellow humor of the Piel
brothers or instructive
presentations such as we
see produced by U.S. Steel
and Alcoa.
Programming and tech-
nical difficulties present
obstacles to successful pay
TV without the addition of
a Federal criminal law as
is proposed by Celler.
This innovation deserves
the trial granted by the
FCC that is in the spirit of
a free competitive system.
