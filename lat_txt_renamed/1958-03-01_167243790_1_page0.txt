RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Farmer Vanishes
While Surplus Grows
In 1930 when unhappy
farmers nearly destroyed
the Republican Party in
the Midwest, there was a
farm population of 30,000,-
000 and 12,500,000 of these
were actually doing farm
work. In 1957 only 7,500,-
000 were tilling the soil.
Thus in 1930 farmers were
25% of the labor force.
Today about an eighth of
those employed are farmers.
Perhaps if this goes
on 1980 will see less than
4,000,000 farmers and by
2000 the last of them will
go to the museums.
*
Still the production
mounts. Output per man-
hour is three times what
it was in 1939. There is
remembered the absurd
claim that if everybody
had enough to eat there
would be no surplus. This
was a part of the flimsy
talk by President Roose-
velt that a third of the
nation was underfed. Perhaps
the healthy appetites
of those millions who left
the hearty eating in the
farm kitchen dulled with
urban life. Perhaps their
choice of food changed.
Anyhow, we couldn't eat
ourselves out of a depres-
sion. Nor shall we ever
accomplish that miracle.
*
Secretary Benson, amid
the hoots and insults of
the House Agriculture
Committee, told the truth
that 90% parity would only
accentuate the problem. He
used various programs
established by Congress
to sell surpluses in
export at cut rates or for
nothing. Also he has tried
the old Wallace policy under
the name Soil Bank to
retire 25,000,000 acres.
And still the surplus
grows.
There are serious international
repercussions about
selling abroad below
the market price, or
by accepting the rubber
currency of some of those
countries in payment or
by giving the stuff away—
for no one expects the
debts of some of those
countries to be paid in
full.
Meanwhile, the economic
report of the President
notes that "despite
a record volume of international
trade in wheat
during 1956-1957, stocks of
major coarse and bread
grains in the four principal
exporting countries as of
July 1, 1957, reached a new
high for the fifth consecutive
year." Our dumping
policy has hardened the
attitude of other countries
toward us.
*
Perhaps the loss in
American popularity in
Canada is in large part due
to our foreign agricultural
giveaway policies. Our
cotton-growing friends
abroad cannot enjoy international
competition with
a cut for export of 20% below
the domestic price.
Nor are our own domestic
industries which buy raw
cotton happy to pay the
full support price while
this is going on.
While Secretary Benson
struggles to maintain that
economic facts are inexorably
at war with all
present and past programs
adopted by Congress, he
encounters the bitter aggressiveness
of the farm
bloc in the House and Senate.
Their way of meeting
an economic fact is to
build thereover a bridge of
dollars exacted from all of
us.

It has been suggested
that in the event of devastating
war there will be a
shortage of food and of
skilled producers of food
and that there should be
created a "human agricultural
reserve." This
might take money, too.
Perhaps, however, in the
awful event of atomic war
only the farmers will be
left to feed themselves and
repopulate the nation.
There is, to be sure, the
alternative of turning
grain into alcohol and oil.
That meets the opposition
of conventional fuel producers,
notably of oil.
This, as I see it, is the
farm problem, a grim, malign,
seemingly incurable
growth eating at the vitals
of the American economy.
