Sweet, to those who
would have Federal con-
trol of education, are the
uses of the Sputnik. The
effort to scatter hundreds
of millions over the land,
'to the needy and unneedy
alike, for school construc-
tion failed. But those who
sponsored that effort were
always after more than
Federal brick and mortar.
The principal component
in the collective "those"—
the National Education
Association, which looks
to a control of our thou-
sands of locally operated
schools—was always after
bigger game than mere in-
animate buildings. It
would have a Federal bu-
reaucracy in Washington
tell local Boards of Ed-
ucation, superintendents,
principals and teachers
what to teach, to whom,
how and when.

The Eisenhower Secre-
tary of Health, Education
and Welfare and his Com-
missioner of Education
seem willing to appease
the NEA and its allies, the
AFL-CIO, the Americans
for Democratic Action and
others. The alibi this year
—and it is an alibi—is the
need for more scientific
education. But their pro-
posals go far beyond that
need. They got to the very
vitals of our teaching, its
content, who should study
what and when a young-
ster should be pigeonholed
for a specific calling in the
life of the nation.
At this point, and for
the benefit of those who
have written to me accus-
ing me of opposing the in-
terests of teachers and
parents, I wish to recall
that I have written two
preceding articles indicat-
ing how some sound and
dedicated members of
Congress and others would
help teachers and parents
through small revisions of
the tax laws, a means
wholly free of Federal
control.

For I would be the last
to fail to recognize the
problems of parents and
teachers. I have been and
am a parent seeking to
give my children a good
education. And I have
been a teacher for 30 years,
beginning in an eight-
grade, one-teacher school
at $35 a month. I oppose
pressure groups which
seek to have basic free-
doms and responsibilities
taken from parents and
teachers by a distant and
collectivist bureaucracy
under the flimsy mask of
an international scientific
marathon.
Health, Education and
Welfare Secretary Marion
B. Folsom substantially
admits this. He said to a
House committee:
"This is a compelling
requirement of national
security today . . . The
need for action in these
fields now is similar to the
need for action to provide
stimulus to training in
trades, industry and agri-
culture 40 years ago."
If Secretary Folsom had
been as close to that de-
velopment as my own
practical experience has
made me, he would know
the almost ridiculous ex-
tremes to which vocation-
al training and its corol-
laries have grown. He
would be aware of the
snap courses in that field,
which have aided slow-
minded athletes to get into
and through college.

The bill sponsored by
Folsom—a four-year, bil-
lion-dollar affair—is paral-
leled by a Democratic
counterproposal for a six-
year, 3-billion-dollar pro-
gram of Federal aid to ed-
ucation.
The administration bill
(HR 10278) provides un-
der Title I for matching
grants to States having
Federally approved plans
to develop counseling,
guidance and testing pro-
grams and Federal schol-
arships to outstanding
high school graduates
(probably to such gradu-
ates as survive the "test-
ing" apparatus). Title II
would provide money for
States with Federally ap-
proved plans for the em-
ployment of more science
and mathematics teachers,
for increasing the salaries
of such teachers, and for
expanding laboratory facil-
ities. These are the major
titles in the bill. Note care-
fully that State plans
must toe the Federal mark
or get no money.
