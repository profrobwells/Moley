HEAD TEST
BATTERIES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If, under the guise of
meeting the Sputnik chal-
lenge, Congress passes the
administration's aid-to-ed-
ucation plan it is probable
that every child in Amer-
ica will, throughout his
school life from its begin-
ning to the 12th grade, be
bombarded by what per-
sonality experts call "bat-
teries" of tests.
These will be paid out of
Federal State matching
money. These tests will
determine, according to
one "expert," what the
youngster is now, what he
will be like later, what he
should do in life and what
his ambitions should be.
According to this man, the
tests will be "relatively
timeless; and they should,
like the people they test,
be multipotential."

Well, we have all been
subjected in our lives, as
have our forefathers, to
"multipotential" tests, al-
though we know no such
fancy name. Our testers
were old Dr. Trial-and-
Error, Dr. Success-and-
Failure, and Dr. Know-
Thyself.
A generation or so ago
Emerson said that the
glory of America was the
young man who tried this
and that, in a land of rest-
lessness and self-reliance,
failing sometimes but al-
ways landing on his feet,
following the star of op-
portunity.
Perhaps my friends in
education will call this old-
fashioned stuff. But I
would like to call to their
attention the fact that the
simple intelligence and ap-
titude tests which only
yesterday were thought to
be scientific and infallible
are now regarded by the
Ph.D.s as old hat.
I would also put into the
record that the Ph.D.s
themselves are more con-
fused than the children
they presume to guide and
that at present the idea is
that children should be
whacked by many differ-
ent tests or, as they call
them, "batteries."

John R. Ludington of
the U.S. Office of Educa-
tion, which wants to spend
the proposed Federal mon-
ey, concedes:
"There are instances
when individual measures
on a single test might not
be reliable. The advantage,
I think, is in having a se-
ries of tests or a battery of
tests rather than reliance
upon a single test."
Why he believes that re-
liance upon many unreli-
able tests will be better
than reliance upon a single
unreliable test I cannot
understand.
The testing fraternity it-
self is hopelessly divided
as to which "batteries" are
good and which are dan-
gerous. Meanwhile, if, as
Secretary Folsom assures
us, this is a matter of na-
tional security, the Rus-
sians may set upon a na-
tion of confused people be-
fuddled by "multipoten-
tialism."

I would recommend for
thoughtful people who
want to make some sense
about all this two books by
authoritative people who
know the nature of testing
and mix some experienced
common sense with their
conclusions. The one is
"Fads and Foibles in Mod-
ern Sociology" by Harvard
Prof. Sorokin. The other is
William H. Whyte Jr.'s
"The Organization Man."
Sorokin says among
many other things that "in
spite of the supposedly
'scientific' nature of mod-
ern tests, they are infested
with many misjudgments
and errors." He proves
this by a mass of incon-
testable proof.
Whyte, with a wealth of
knowledge of aptitude
tests in business, con-
cludes that "the sheer me-
chanics of the tests pun-
ish the exceptional man."
Also, that testing for busi-
ness jobs contributes to
bureaucratization and con-
formity. And he quotes J.
A. Generalli, head of the
UCLA psychology depart-
ment, who says, "We have
a social force that selec-
tively encourages and re-
wards the scientific hack."
Perhaps, as in the case
of many other of the Pres-
ident's problems, includ-
ing those in the military
services, he should appoint
a commission to find out
what testing means. Ap-
parently his Bureau of Ed-
ucation is completely con-
fused.
