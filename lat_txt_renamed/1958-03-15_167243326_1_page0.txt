RAYMOND MOLEY:
-Disability Muddle
and Congress' Duty
In order to think about
the debated question of
who should do what when
a President is disabled, I
suggest that we examine
the constitutional provision which in part covers it:
Article II, Section 1,
Clause 5: "In case of the
removal of the President
from office, or of his death,
resignation, or inability to
discharge the power and
duties of the said office,
the same shall devolve
upon the Vice-President,
and the Congress may by
law provide for the case
of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of
the President and Vice-
President, declaring what
officer shall then act as
President, and such officer
shall act accordingly until
the disability be removed
or a President shall be
elected."
It is clear that, despite,
the great legal and political distinction of the men
who drafted the Constitution and of the final committee of the convention
of 1787, which was supposed to refine the language of the document,
there was a bit of carelessness in that language.
Witness, for example, the
interchange of the words,
"inability" and "disability."

Speaker Sam Rayburn
says there is no provision
in the Constitution for an
"Acting President." Instead of quibbling over a
title, Speaker Rayburn
should remind himself
that in the course of his
many years in the House
the issue has become acute
three times, and that in all
his long service Congress
has been neglecting the
duty imposed upon it by
the Constitution.
The so-called pact between
the President and
Vice-President- under
which by mutual consent
the Vice-President would
assume the powers and
duties of the Presidency-
is meaningless except in
that the President assigns
the responsibility in case
he, himself, is unable to
make the decision. The
mere assignment of his
powers and duties to the
Vice-President is 'something that could be done
in any event because of
the absence of Congressional action beforehand.
But who is to determine
when the President is unable to make the decision
for himself? Probably
Sherman Adams.
A sound procedure
should be provided by constitutional amendment,
much the same as would
be followed in case of impeachment. The initiative
should lie with the House
Judiciary Committee (perhaps in conjunction with
the Senate Judiciary
Committee). The House
through duly selected
members should propose
a declaration of "inability"
to the Senate which would
be sitting as a jury. The
Chief Justice should preside. After a review of all
the evidence presented by
competent medical authorities and others, the Senate
should act, with perhaps a two-thirds majority
requirement.
*
Those who would object
on the ground that politics
might enter into the decision should be reminded
that the eyes of the country would be upon such
proceedings and that politicians are responsive to
opinion.
Provision should be
made at the same time for
periodic checks to determine when the "disability
would be removed," and
a restoration of the "powers and duties" should be
made by the same procedure.
The Congress is, after
all, the proper agent for
such a decision, since it
would in such a case be
the sole authority directly
responsible to the people
of the nation. Since Congress seems disposed to do
its long-neglected constitutional duty, it should enact something better than
a makeshift.
