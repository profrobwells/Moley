MEASURING
A LEADER -
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may be, when the last
estimates are made, that
Dwight Eisenhower will
be deemed a very success-
ful military leader, a man
who enjoyed the ardent af-
fection of his countrymen,
who ran most powerfully
for President twice, but
who, in the end, was a
tragic failure as a party
leader.
I have traveled through
20 States in the past six
weeks and have found
affection for the man in the
White House and a rap-
idly diminishing confi-
dence in him as a national
leader and executive.
Among Republicans there
is complete lack of confi-
dence that he can success-
fully lead his party.

True, many of those
States were in the South
and Southwest, where the
Republican Party has been
fatally blighted by the ep-
isode at Little Rock. But
elsewhere among political
leaders there is the reluc-
tant conclusion that if Sen-
atorial and House and
State candidates are to win
this fall, they will have to
do the job themselves.
A fair example of this
condition is in Massachu-
setts, a State that I did not
visit but about which I
have the best of informa-
tion.

A major shift of control
within the Republican
Party is taking place
there. The older leader-
ship-in which the names
of Saltonstall, Sinclair
Weeks, Christian A. Her-
ter, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.
and Robert Cutler, now
Presidential assistant,
have figured prominently
-means very little in
State plans, policies, and
the selection of candidates.
The party, it is recognized
by practical politicians
there, has been in deepen-
ing trouble for 10 years.
It is true that Herter was
elected Governor in 1952
and 1954, but he failed to
check the decay of the or-
ganization. Most of the
people I have mentioned
are regarded as Eisenhow-
er or "modern" Republi-
cans and are disregarded
by the rank and file.
Late in 1957 the State
chairman of the party re-
signed. Before the Salton-
stall-Weeks-Lodge-Herter-
Cutler group awakened to
the situation, the rank and
file had elected Daniel Mc-
Lean as his successor. The
party is thus passing from
under the control of a
group of proper Bosto-
nians who have held forth
for a generation or more.

The choice of the reg-
ular Republicans to op-
pose Gov. Foster Furcolo
is George Fingold, three
times Attorney General
and in 1956 the only Re-
publican to survive a
Democratic sweep in the
State. Thus he is popular,
a good campaigner, and
would win many conserva-
tive Democrats. The Wash-
ington group will prob-
ably have as a candidate
Christian A. Herter Jr.,
who is also at present in
the Washington bureauc-
racy.
The thing that is funda-
mental in this party re-
construction in Massachu-
setts is that people there
realize that the party can
survive only by doing
what a party is supposed
to do: keep close to the
electorate and elect can-
didates. The old group has
gone off on the mission of
world-saving-a mission,
like prohibition, "noble in
purpose" but hardly of
immediate interest to the
people who live close to
the realities of every day.
Above all, the term "mod-
ern" Republican is dis-
tasteful to them. They are
anxious to restore real two-
party government and are
determined to show that
their party is not dead in
the Bay State.
