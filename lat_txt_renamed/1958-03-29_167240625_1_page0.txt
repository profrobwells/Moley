RAYMOND MOLEY:
Sen. Byrd Speaks Out
on Fiscal Program
Since a tax cut seems to
be inevitable and more
spending is an already ac-
complished fact, the ques-
tion arises as to how long
it will be before taxes will
be restored to the present
level or increased.
Sen. Harry F. Byrd, in
a short but tremendously
important speech before
the Senate last week, of-
fered light upon this sub-
ject.
In January the Presi-
dent estimated tax receipts
for the year ending June
30, 1959, at $74,400,000,000.
The Byrd March estimate
is 72 billion dollars, with
a prospect of a further
drop in the remainder of
the present calendar year
and the first six months of
1959. This is exclusive of
a tax cut, which would
cause a further deficit of
between 7 billion and 8 bil-
lion dollars. Altogether,
the Byrd estimate of a
1959 deficit is about 15 bil-
lion dollars.
For the present fiscal
year, ending June 30, next,
Byrd estimates a 2-billion-
dollar deficit.

He points out that the
President and his advisers
were deluded into far too
low an estimate of what
would be spent in the
present year if the Presi-
dent's proposed new pro-
grams should be allowed-
an estimate more than 1
billion dollars too low. Per-
haps, Byrd indicated, the
national debt will rise from
the present "temporary"
limit of 280 billion dollars
to 300 billion dollars.
Anyone who must de-
pend upon a fixed income,
including pensions, and re-
turns on bonds and sav-
ings knows where these
vast values will be found.
They are in the savings of
the nation, always robbed
to meet present wants (not
needs) prompted mostly
by political considerations.
For every dollar of a defi-
cit increases the green cab-
bage in circulation but
only remotely increases
the production of wealth.
The situation is intensi-
fied by an even graver
probability. Programs for
spending initiated now will
not end with the end of the
recession. They go on year
after year. Byrd says
"there is no such thing as
temporary large-scale defi-
cit financing. We know
from 28 years' experience
that a deficit is not turned
off and on as if controlled
by a spigot. If the 1959
deficit is as large as is pres-
ently indicated, Federal
deficits would continue as
long as anyone can fore-
see."
*
In another speech last
week Dr. Arthur F. Burns,
former Presidential adviser,
pointed out the fallacy of
using public works spend-
ing as a means of stopping
a recession. The short an-
swer he made was that "it
would take too long." This
was amply proved in 1933
when President Roosevelt
—who at the time did not
believe in a public works
make-work program—com-
promised between the 5
billion dollars for which
spenders were calling and
his own estimate that only
1 billion dollars could be
spent on useful Federal
projects.
His compromise figure
was $3,300,000,000. But
when it came to spending
this vast sum (for those
days), Secretary Ickes got
rid of less than $100,000,-
000 a year. Granted, Ickes
was suspicious and cau-
tious. At one time he had
a staff of 750 snoopers po-
licing contractors and pub-
lic officials to see that there
should be no graft in-
volved.
*
Nevertheless, there were
and always will be long
delays on big projects.
Plans must be made, blue-
prints drawn, contracts in-
vited and passed upon, ma-
terials assembled and men,
including scarce engineers,
recruited. In one project
for a $10,000,000 atomic re-
actor plant which a cer-
tain large company was to
build for the government
there were many months
of planning and the ex-
penditure of $1,000,000 by
the company before all ne-
gotiations broke up. The
company took its loss and
quit.
A tax cut probably
would be wise. Taxes are
too high and are a deter-
rent to enterprise. But let
us have some signs of
economy first.
