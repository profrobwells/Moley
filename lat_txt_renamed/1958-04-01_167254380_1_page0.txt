MORE ON THOSE IQ TESTS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Four weeks ago I dis-
cussed in one of these col-
umns the Eisenhower ad-
ministration's proposal for
large matching grants to
States for the wide exten-
sion of aptitude testing in
the schools. A number of
teachers have written to
me, disagreeing with some
of my conclusions and as-
serting the value of past
and present use of such
tests as an integral part
of student guidance.
Since most of these were
sincere and reasonable
protests, but based upon a
misapprehension of the
points I made in the
article, it will clarify mat-
ters to deal with the sub-
ject again.
First let us see exactly
what Marion B. Folsom,
Secretary of the De-
partment of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare, and
his Commissioner of Educa-
tion are recommending to
Congress. They would pro-
vide for the coming four
years something like $80,-
000,000 in Federal money,
to which the participating
States must add an equal
amount. This $160,000,000
is not an insignificant mat-
ter, considering the critical
need for immediate and
specific outlays for other
purposes.
Under the bill, the Fed-
eral government through
the Bureau of Education
must approve of the
States' plans and must re-
ceive periodic reports.
This means in substance
that the Federal govern-
ment will indirectly deter-
mine the character and
standards of the tests. The
tests must be given to all
ninth-graders and below
and to students in the 11th
and 12th grades—that is,
to practically all American
children.
But there is very wide
disagreement among the
experts concerning the na-
ture of aptitude tests and
their value. The old "intel-
ligence" tests are now
pretty generally regarded
as obsolete by the people
who seem to be pushing
this new Federal-aid plan.
John R. Ludington of the
U.S. Office of Education,
recognizing this uncertain-
ty and confusion, proposes
that a "battery of tests" be
to do with the original de-
velopment of "intelli-
gence" tests, made it clear
that they were not to be
taken too seriously. He
said: "Just what they
measure is not known . . .
just what the measures ob-
tained signify concerning
'the intellect is not known."
Considering this, does
not a great danger exist in
such a magnification of
testing as the administra-
tion proposes—the danger
that the children them-
selves will come to believe
that they are "just aver-
age" or "not very smart,"
or that they are unusual?
The depressing effect of
the first two of the con-
clusions is obvious. The
toxic effect of the third is
also obvious.
Children, indeed all of
us to a considerable de-
gree, are the product of
self-generated virtues
which every good teacher
encourages, such as con-
centration, integrity and
the capacity for hard work.
I object to the pigeonhol-
ing of anyone by anyone.
Let us keep alive the in-
spirational principle—or
hypothesis, if you will—
that given opportunity
without too much guid-
ance or dictation, a boy or
girl can achieve objectives
beyond the capacity of any
expert tester to predict.
Finally, I would suggest
to teachers that this ad-
ministration proposal, like
the rest of the Federal-aid
proposals, is a link in the
inevitable chain of Feder-
al domination of the
schools—a domination
which will pigeonhole
teachers as well as pupils,
according to the specifica-
tions of a bureaucracy in
Washington.
