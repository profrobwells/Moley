RAYMOND MOLEY:
Jobless Aid Program
Satisfies No One
In the hearings before the
House Ways and Means
Committee on the Presi
dent's proposal to provide
Federal money for work-
ers who have exhausted
their unemployment ben-
efits, Secretary Mitchell
found himself caught be-
tween two fires:
His ordeal suggests the
futility of the administra-
tion's effort to compromise
with "liberal" policies in
Federal aid. This has
already been shown, over
and over, in the labor
union field. No matter
what the administration is
willing to concede, "lib-
eral" Democrats will out-
bid it and union politicians
will oppose all and sundry
Republican candidates.
★
The proposal, in brief,
would provide a special
Federal handout to a
small proportion of the
unemployed, with dubious
prospect of recovery of the
"loan" from States and
employers sometime in the
future.
It is hard to see the ap-
plication of this measure,
either as a means of fight-
ing the recession or as a
means of aiding the really
needy. For the sums thus
distributed would affect
the general economy only
in an infinitesimal degree,
and thousands of unem-
ployed who might need
help could not qualify
under the terms of such
a measure.
*
Of course, Secretary
Mitchell protested that the
plan would only be tem-
porary. But there is the
indisputable fact that once
the Federal government
takes over a responsibility
now borne by the States,
it never escapes. It only
gets in deeper and deeper.
"Liberal" Democrats led
by Rep. McCarthy, who
himself has a bill going
much farther toward Fed-
eralizing unemployment
benefits than the adminis-
tration's, scolded the Sec-
retary for not coming out
frankly for Federal regu-
lation of the whole system
by setting standards. Mc-
Carthy argued, in effect,
that all "important" social
legislation in the past had
been passed in time of
national distress. Therefore, why not use the recession as an excuse to take over unemployment compensation?

In reply to questioning
by another member of the
committee, Mitchell admitted that under the
present law the so-called
Reed fund could be drawn
upon by the States which
were unable to extend
their payments. Thus we
have, at least by implication, an admission that
when the States believe
they do not need something it is necessary for
Uncle Sam to enter the
States and do the job
himself.
A Congressman from
Virginia protested that the
plan would make it possible for the Federal government—in case a State
refused the job of distributing the funds as its
agent—to distribute funds
in the unwilling State and
establish an obligation despite the State's protest.
*
Representatives from
other States pointed out
that they needed no such
help.
Several indicated a
widespread conviction
that, once the Federal government established this
plan, it would mean the
beginning of the end of
State responsibility for the
unemployed. To Mitchell's
response that the plan was
only a "temporary" one,
many instances were
cited to show that past
plans labeled "temporary"
proved to be permanent.
One witness at the hearings commented that apparently Mitchell ended
his testimony with only
one friend on the committee. That was Chairman
Daniel Reed who, since he
had introduced the
administration's bill, remained discreetly silent.
And so the old truth
was underlined: When a
person compromises with
principle, he loses the
support of both sides—
and principle, too.
