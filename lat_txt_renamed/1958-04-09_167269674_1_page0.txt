RAYMOND MOLEY:
U.S. to Feel Effects
of Canadian Election
The immense sweep of
John Diefenbaker's Con-
servative Party (officially
the Progressive-Conserva-
tive Party) in Canada has
a great many aspects of
concern to those of us who
live this side of the border.
It was not a sudden
wave of anti-U.S. feeling
among our Canadian cousins.
In both major parties
there has been a stiffen-
ing sense of independence
from our influence upon
the Canadian economy.
Nor was it a victory for
true conservatism. Diefen-
baker and his associates
were as liberal with their
promises as our Steven-
sons and "modern" Re-
publicans. In fact, Ameri-
can conservatives of the
Byrd or Bricker type
would have had a hard job
choosing between Canadi-
an Conservatives and Lib-
erals. Both parties have
the welfare state well up
in the list of their policies.
Diefenbaker is far from
being a true heir to former
Prime Ministers like Robert
L. Borden or Arthur
Meighan.
My surprise in this election
was at what happened
in the vital Provinces of
Quebec, Saskatchewan, Al-
berta, and British Colum-
bia.
*
The present political ascendency in Quebec is sui
generis in Canada. Indeed,
it has no parallel in the
United States or in any
other country with which
I am familiar. Maurice
Duplessis, the Premier and
unquestioned political boss
of Quebec, is in ideology
a very conservative leader.
His party is really a
Duplessis affair, although
for convenience and legal
purposes it is called the
Union National.
Duplessis is without
doubt the most potent and
able politician in all Canada.
When I was on a cross-
country tour of Canada, a
Conservative editor in To-
ronto, who is also a power
in the politics of Quebec
and Ontario, talked vaguely
to me of a possible deal
between Duplessis and the
Conservative Party in On-
tario. Apparently this has
taken place.
Duplessis has been
seemingly indifferent to
Dominion elections. He has
swept his province over
and over, but in national
elections his people have
followed tradition in electing
Liberals to sit in Ot-
tawa. This time, he put
on the pressure of his machine and gave the Conservatives 50 of the 75 members from Quebec. In
the previous Parliament
the Conservatives had only
nine.
In Saskatchewan, the
Co-Operative Common-
wealth Federation has
held power for years. The
party seems to have originated in the depressed
years of the late 1920s. Its
policies are Socialism of
the fairly extreme left. It
appeals to farmers and industrial workers alike
with the usual Socialist
nostrums. The CCF sent
25 members to the last
Parliament. The count
now is eight—one from
Saskatchewan, four from
British Columbia, and
three from Ontario.

I was much interested
in my visit to Saskatche-
wan to see what a Socialist
government could do
in action. It was the most
incompetent outfit I have
ever seen. The Saskatche-
wan highways are the
worst on the North American
continent, not excepting
Mexico. And this
amid incalculably rich
natural resources.
The Premier is a personable
minister of the gospel,
Thomas C. Douglas. His
chief brain truster, whom
I interviewed, was a Japanese who was in British
Columbia during the war,
and his Socialism is tinted
with his resentment
against the treatment accorded members of his
race who lived in the
American West. Douglas,
in answer to my question
concerning the birth of his
ideas, said that he learned
them in Minnesota. His
ideas were vague, visionary
and sentimental.
★
In Alberta and British
Columbia, the Social Credit
Party, which dominates
both provincial governments, carried no seats at
all in the recent election.
But Social Credit is only
a name. The doctrine, promulgated by the Rev. William Aberhart, is given
only lip service.
These provincial governments have been extremely hospitable to
American oil and mineral
companies, and the governments' profits therefrom have been great
enough to turn the party
into a truly conservative
mold. Oddly enough, the
Social Credit Premier of
Alberta is, like Douglas in
Saskatchewan, a minister
of the gospel.
Now Canada has a real
two-party system, for the
first time in three decades.
