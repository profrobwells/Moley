RAYMOND MOLEY:
Senate Seeks More
Reclamation Funds
In a most unusual step
the Senate, by a resolution
($299), has prodded
the administration, as well
as its own Appropriation
Committee, to increase by
40% the budget requests
for irrigation and water
power projects in the 17
western reclamation
States. To get this in perspective, let us look at the
status under which the
government is now proceeding with these activities.
*
In the President's January budget he asked for an
appropriation on reclamation of $160,000,000. Then,
in March, the President
sent to Congress a $71,000,000 additional request
for reclamation projects
already under construction and the rehabilitation
of certain existing irrigation projects. This
brought the total requests
for reclamation to $231,000,000, which should be
compared with the $174,000,000 requested in the
budget for the preceding
year.
Senate Resolution 299,
which passed by a substantial majority, asks for
$330,000,000 for the fiscal
year ending in 1959.
On this background it
should be noted that the
Bureau of Reclamation is
already at work on many
projects now authorized
and for which appropriations have been made
from year to year. The
ultimate outlay for these
will be many hundreds of
millions or a number of
billions, counting interest
on the money before they
are completed. In other
words, there is a great leeway for acceleration of
these projects and the
consequent increase in
money spent in the States
in question.
*
I can see no great objection to the acceleration of
projects which are already
underway in this time of
business recession. The
giant Upper Colorado
Project, over which a long
fight was waged, has been
passed and work has begun on some of its units.
Many who disagreed with
the need for and feasibility
of parts of this great project recognize that they
have lost the final verdict
and are reconciled to seeing it proceed. This is true
of other projects under
way.
Senate Resolution 299,
however, is not content
with the acceleration of
existing projects under
construction. It calls for
"new starts" on 20 additional projects. Sen. Anderson, author of S. 299,
however, mentioned in his
speech supporting it the
"prompt authorization of
additional feasible reclamation projects."
*
To tie these new starts
on already authorized projects and the authorization
of more new projects is a
very doubtful means of
helping immediate economic conditions, even if
we grant that such outlays
on public works are a
sound way of increasing
employment and pulling
us out of the recession. For
all new starts must require
weeks and weeks of hearings, months of engineering, planning and, beyond
that, more months of preparation before a cent is
spent in moving dirt or
pouring concrete or in
making the essential machinery.
*
In his budget the President announced no new
starts for this year and he
has repeatedly indicated
that, by accelerating projects already under way,
the limit of present spending could be attained.
One cannot help but tie
this Senate move to the
President's veto of the
huge pork-barrel Army
Engineers' bill. In that
case the President was
apprised of a fact that
was brought out only a
few years ago by a chief
of the Army Engineers. He
said that Army Engineers'
projects already authorized could be divided into
three partsâ€”the projects
needed and under way,
the projects needed and
which could be started
with new appropriations,
and a good third which
were projects that had
been authorized but were
not needed at all. So there
is plenty of leeway there
already.
This move of the Senate for a similar omnibus
authorization in the reclamation field under cover
of the recession covers too
much ground and if carried out would mortgage
Federal revenues far into
a future which is at this
point highly speculative.
