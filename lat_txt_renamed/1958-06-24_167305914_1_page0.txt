Conservatives in New
York State who do not
hesitate to cross party
lines will have two very
attractive candidates for
the Governorship and the
Senate seat vacated by Ir-
ving Ives.
Leonard W. Hall is seek-
ing the Republican nomi-
nation for Governor and
James A. Farley has an-
nounced his candidacy for
the U.S. Senate seat on the
Democratic ticket.
Those two share a very
special distinction. Both
were in command of the
national committees of
their respective parties in
years when the Presidency
changed sides. The late
Will H. Hays preceded
them in this distinction.
★
Hall and Farley have
other characteristics in
common. Both are, meas-
ured by the standards of
their parties, moderately
to the right. They are alike
personally in being hearty,
practical, likable politi-
cians of long experience.
Hall is opposed by two
formidable candidates.
State Senate Leader Wal-
ter J. Mahoney of Buffalo
is seeking the Republican
nomination for Governor
and has pledges of some-
thing like 180 convention
votes from upstate. Nelson
Rockefeller is being pro-
moted by a group of Park
Ave. Republicans and
quasi-Democratic, interna-
tionally minded individ-
uals—what Thomas E.
Dewey used to call the
"station wagon set"—and
has pledges of 74 from
Westchester and Putnam
Counties. His group is still
impressed by their success
in the "Willkie blitz" of
1940. Hall, with the strong
support of his native Long
Island counties, is second
with 161 pledges. It will
require 586 to nominate in
the Rochester convention
in August.

Farley's announcement
poses a difficult problem
for Tammany Leader Car-
mine De Sapio and his pro-
tégé, Gov. Harriman. Far-
ley has retained his status
as a foremost citizen dur-
ing his 18 years in busi-
ness. He is powerful with
the large Roman Catholic
population and with con-
servative Democrats who
have not forgotten Alfred
E. Smith.
Farley merely observed
the amenities by notifying
Harriman and De Sapio of
his intention. Then, after
Farley's announcement,
De Sapio issued a noncom-
mittal statement. Harri-
man was even more reti-
cent. It is clear that Far-
ley's break with F. D. R.
has left some bitterness
among the "liberals" in
the party. That means that
those, such as Harriman,
who rose under F. D. R.,
privately oppose him.
★
It means also that David
Dubinsky's splinter Liber-
al Party cannot support
Farley and its vote has
provided the vital margin
for Democrats in the State
several times. But to alien-
ate the friends of Farley
in those two groups would
be a hazard of the first or-
der for De Sapio and Har-
riman.
Farley, hearty and inde-
pendent at a robust 70, is
deadly serious about run-
ning. If chosen by the
Democratic convention
and elected, he would have
no special obligations to
the "liberal" line.
No doubt Harriman and
De Sapio would prefer
Robert F. Wagner, who
craves the quiet of his
father's Senate seat and is
just entering the ultimate
darkening that has de-
stroyed the future of every
Democratic Mayor of New
York in modern times.
★
Rockefeller has no pub-
lic or official record worthy
of the nomination for Gov-
ernor, but his promoters
are well financed and his
cause has been carefully
promoted by the publica-
tion of a series of reports
by the Rockefeller broth-
ers' fund. These have
mostly advocated more
spending and lower taxes.
Grandpapa Rockefeller
would probably have re-
gretted this use of his
money, but perhaps the
ghost of that thrifty
man has developed immu-
nity to shocks.
It is clear from what I
have learned here in New
York County that, if
Rockefeller is nominated,
there will be the same sort
of election-day paralysis
among Republicans that
elected Harriman four
years ago. If Republicans
gagged at Ives then, they
will do worse this year
with a product of another
"Willkie blitz."
