RAYMOND MOLEY:
Ohio Republicans
Brace for Challenge
In a visit to Canton, O.,
during the past week I
found Republican plans in
the making to meet the
threat of a Democratic
sweep. These plans are
based upon the sound polit-
ical principle that there
is no such thing as a na-
tional election in an off
year. There are, instead,
more than 3000 contests
in Congressional districts
and a score of Senatorial
contests. Each contest pre-
sents special problems to
candidates and parties,
and each is deeply affected
by local rather than na-
tional conditions.
This year this will be
particularly true not only
in Canton and its sur-
rounding area, but in a
great many other local
communities and States.
For the embarrassments
and misfortunes of the
Eisenhower administra-
tion mean that no candi-
date for the Senate or
House can hope to get
much help by attempting
to ride on the coattails of
the general in the White
House. This is amply in-
dicated at the moment by
the number of Republican
members of Congress who
have taken pains to assert
that Sherman Adams is
certainly no asset to the
party to which he belongs.
This attitude toward Ad-
ams was present even be-
fore the name Goldfine
burst into the public
prints.

The 16th Ohio District
has been stalwartly Re-
publican since back be-
yond the days when Wil-
liam McKinley represent-
ed it three-quarters of a
century ago. Frank Bow,
an outstandingly able and
forthright conservative,
represents it now. The dis-
trict also intends to throw
all of its energies toward
the re-election of Sen. John
Bricker and Gov. William
O'Neil this year.
The Republican organi-
zation in Stark County is
already busy in mobiliz-
ing party workers, recruit-
ed to a considerable de-
gree from among the jun-
ior executives of the im-
portant industries in the
area. It is well aware that
in the forthcoming cam-
paign in Ohio, as in the fa-
mous Taft campaign in
1950, the 'real opposition
will not be the formal and
traditional Democratic
Party, but the powerful,
well-trained and well-fi-
nanced AFL-CIO Commit-
tee on Political Education.
To meet this challenge
it is planned to employ in
Stark County a full-time,
year-round professional
executive for the party or-
ganization. Republicans in
Canton are convinced that
such professional direction
in the party is essential to
meet the professionalism
of AFL-CIO's COPE. This
Republican professional
organizer will, like constit-
uency agents in the Brit-
ish system, devote himself
to mobilizing and training
volunteers and raising the
necessary funds to main-
tain party activities
through the year, and
serve as a means of in-
forming the electorate con-
cerning national issues and
especially the part taken
by the representatives of
the district in State affairs
and in Congress.

This sort of expert di-
rection for the Republican
Party is a crying need
everywhere in these days
when there is the chal-
lenge of a Democratic
Party beefed up if not
dominated by the highly
expert professionalism of
the political arms of the
big unions.
Unless the Republican
Party is willing to accept
chronic defeat, its local
organizations, now impro-
vised only when an elec-
tion impends, must be or-
ganized with professional
direction in every com-
munity where there is im-
portant industrial life.
This realization came to
the Conservative Party in
England only after its
catastrophic defeat by La-
bor in 1945, and it built its
organization well and re-
turned to power. The days
are past when politics
could be regarded as a lei-
surely, casual, part-time
matter.
