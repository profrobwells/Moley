RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Clear Statement
on Higher Education
This is the time when
the thoughts of thousands
turn college ward: "bright,
happy years" and all that
sort of thing. There are
visits to colleges by gradu-
ates for class reunions, in-
numerable addresses by
college administrators and
by commencement speak-
ers, and learned editorials
in the public press.
Much of the comment
has properly pointed to the
need for generous aid for
private colleges.
*
This year interest in the
problems of higher educa-
tion is greater than ever.
Within 12 months there
have been the Sputniks
and the revelation of our
deficiencies in science
teaching. There is also the
recession, with a great
tide of proposals in Con-
gress for spending, in-
cluding various schemes
for helping either educa-
tion, the educators or the
educated. There has also
been a new Eisenhower
program designed mostly
to deal with some phases
of higher education.
In the midst of all this,
it is useful to single out a
calm, constructive, factual
statement on the subject of
higher education by an
able and successful college
president who tilts at
no windmills of education-
al faddism.
George C. S. Benson is
president of Claremont
Men's College in Cali-
fornia. He was also direc-
tor of research for the
President's Commission on
Intergovernmental Rela-
tions, which went into the
subject of Federal grants
in considerable detail.
Thus, Benson is able to
know and evaluate not
only the real, as against
the fancied, needs of pri-
vate colleges, but also the
nature and consequences
of Federal intervention in
their support.
*
His essay, "National Aid
to Higher Education," was
published recently by the
American Enterprise As-
sociation. He was assisted
in this study by John M.
Payne.
The Benson study comes
to grips with proposals for
Federal aid sponsored in
Congress not only by
President Eisenhower but
by a wide variety of mem-
bers.
Like President Eisen-
hower's brother, Dr. Mil-
ton Eisenhower of Johns
Hopkins, Benson flatly op-
poses any Federal aid,
with a few minor conces-
sions. He says, and proves
from experience, that
whenever Congress sends
money anywhere, a bu-
reaucrat follows close be-
hind. Thus aid begets
control-political and ideo-
logical and such control
is a mortal peril to the in-
dependence and freedom
of academic inquiry and
teaching.
He points out that while
the number of students
enrolled in our colleges is
due to continue to rise con-
siderably in the foreseea-
ble future, private support
is also expanding and will,
if continued, meet the
needs in the years im-
mediately ahead. Private
giving to colleges doubled
between the years 1955
and 1957.
*
A college education is a
valuable asset and should,
so far as possible, be paid
for by those parents and
students who are the bene-
ficiaries. This will mean
higher tuitions. But to
ease the pressure in that
respect, there should be
some legislation like the
Boggs-McCarthy bill,
which would provide tax
relief to parents who are
sending their children to
college. There might also
be some provision for a
student who borrows
money to finance his edu-
cation to have a tax deduc-
tion in his later years.
So far as student loans
and scholarships are con-
cerned, Benson notes that
the President's Committee
on Education beyond High
School reported in 1957
that there is already a sur-
plus of loan funds in many
colleges and that the rem-
edy for any deficiency in
other institutions might
well be remedied without
Federal help.
*
While the Ford Founda-
tion recently made sub-
stantial grants to colleges,
it is still true that Ford,
as well as many of the
other large foundations,
might well provide funds
to meet the needs of col-
leges and the students
therein. Under existing
tax pressure, much of the
wealth of the nation is ac-
cumulating in foundations,
and altogether too many
of these institutions are
concerned not in helping
colleges do their jobs in
their own way, but in
thinking up new ways to
spend what they have.
The facts presented by
the Benson study amply
justify his conclusion:
"Any national (Federal)
grant is a camel's nose in
education's tent. Both his-
tory and folklore suggest
that the camel will even-
tually take over."
