RAYMOND MOLEY:
Some Fallacies About
Schools Exploded
Not only those educators
who believe that they are
giving our children the
best, because most modern
of instructions, but those
who say they could do
better with more money
will be shaken badly by a
most brilliant analysis of
education which has re-
cently appeared. It is
"School Needs in the Dec-
ade Ahead," by Roger A.
Freeman.
The author is no new-
comer in the controversy
over schools and education.
He was research director
of the committee on
schools in the President's
Commission on Intergov-
ernmental Relations,
whose excellent recom-
mendations have been sad-
ly neglected by the Presi-
dent and Congress. Free-
man was also consultant
on school finance to the
White House Conference
on Education of two years
ago.
*
By a most thorough and
elaborate analysis of of-
ficial figures, he dissipates
the fallacious claims that
the American people have
starved their schools to
the extent that they are
hopelessly overcrowded
and understaffed and that
our teachers are white-
collar slaves. Freeman's
thesis is that the real
needs are more efficient
use of what money is avail-
able and the elimination
of frills in the curriculum,
rather than more money—
presumably Federal
money.
*
A most telling piece of
evidence that a very large
number of parents are un-
happy over what their
children are getting in
the public schools is Free-
man's revelation of the
large number who are
keeping their children out
of the public schools and
are sending them, at add-
ed expense to themselves,
to various sorts of pri-
vate institutions.
He points out that be-
tween 1900 and 1930 the
enrollment in nonpublic
schools increased very
slowly—from 8% to 9.4%
of total elementary and
secondary school enroll-
ment. In the 1930s the per-
centage remained at that
figure. But then some-
thing happened. Nonpub-
lic school enrollment in-
creased four times as fast
as that in public schools
from 1940 to 1955. Public
school enrollment in-
creased 22%; nonpublic
school enrollment, 86%.
Twenty-nine per cent of
the total increase in school
enrollment in those years
was accounted for by the
nonpublic schools. In 1940,
enrollment in nonpublic
schools (elementary and
secondary) was 2,660,000.
In 1956 it was 4,954,000.
*
This flight from the
public schools has not
been unnoticed. Even the
U.S. Office of Education,
dedicated as it has been
to the philosophy and
claims of the National Ed-
ucation Association, admit-
ted it. But is ascribed the
flight vaguely to "social
and economic causes." An
article in the magazine
America called "Justice
for Religious Schools" in
1957 was more outspoken
and, in my judgment,
more accurate. It said:
"Actually, the most se-
rious threat to the public
school is not the private or
parochial school, but its
own double failure in edu-
cation and religion. Par-
ents are disturbed about
why Johnny can't read, or
write or do almost any-
thing that used to be re-
garded as schooling."
*
Laboring under financial
limitations vastly more se-
rious than the public
schools, a great proportion
of these private and paro-
chial schools have stuck to
the fundamentals of educa-
tion and are, moreover, do-
ing their part to plant high
standards of conduct in the
moral endowment of this
generation.
Meanwhile, some of the
public educators who are
most vociferous in clamor-
ing for Federal money are
providing, in the schools
which they direct, a lot of
stuff which might be called
"good, clean entertain-
ment," but which hardly
deserves the characteriza-
tion of education. The
seeds sown by John Dewey
and others of his school of
philosophy are in full
bloom, and millions of par-
ents are not happy about
it.
