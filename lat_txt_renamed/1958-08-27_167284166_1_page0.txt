SCHOOL AID
SURVEY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There has been no more
effective critic of the Federal
aid-to-education
movement than Archbishop
John F. O'Hara of
Philadelphia. This distinguished
prelate knows
what he is talking about
in the field of education
because he was formerly
president of Notre Dame
University and now has
responsibility for one of
the leading parochial
school systems.
His arguments are not
based upon the fact of discrimination
against private
schools in all Federal
aid proposals but upon the
solid statistical facts concerning
need.
In the Catholic Standard
and Times of Philadelphia
this month he presents
some cold facts
about this year's proposals
of the administration
which were eagerly abetted
and enlarged by the
"liberals" in Congress.
So far as the need for
scholarships is concerned,
the Archbishop presents
the results of a study
made by Wilbur Young,
State Superintendent of
Public Instruction in Indiana.
★
This study is based upon
a questionnaire answered
by 707 high school principals
in Indiana. These
high school principals at
first estimated that 2000
seniors could possibly
qualify for scholarships on
the basis of need, interest
and ability. But in a test
given in April of this year
in mathematics, science,
English and social studies
only 199 of the 2000 received
a grade of 90 or
above in mathematics and
science. (The great argument
by the advocates of
the Federal-aid plan was
that it was directed at
"gifted" students and also
that the need was for
those "gifted" in mathematics
and science.)
Of the 199, it was decided
to eliminate those
who rated below 95 in
mathematics and science
and those who rated 90 or
below in English and social
studies. This eliminated
20. The remaining 179
students were then questioned
concerning their
ability to finance their college
education. Of these, 23
did not reply, and it was
assumed that they had no
such need or inclination.
Fourteen said they had
financial resources for attending
college. Twenty-
five answered that they
were not planning to specialize
or enter fields involving
mathematics and
science.
★
A "need" formula was
applied to the remaining
117 students. This test has
been widely used throughout
the United States to
determine whether there
is actual financial need to
guarantee at least one year
of college work. It should
be applied because no student
should be the sole
judge of his need. This test
eliminated 64 more. And of
the 53 qualifying, 37 already
had scholarships.
The Indiana superintendent
stated that he was
making plans to provide,
without Federal help, not
only for the 16, but for additional
help for those
whose scholarships were
inadequate.
Archbishop O'Hara
makes short shrift of the
theoretical arguments for
Federal aid for guidance
tests. He quotes this from
a publication of the very
U.S. Office of Education
that has been clamoring
for Federal aid.
★
"It must be reiterated
that in spite of some hopeful
variations counseling
services and facilities have
been rated as unsatisfactory."
Yet the Federal government
wants to subsidize
schemes that have never
proved themselves.
The Archbishop adds
this personal comment:
"It will serve a public
need if we point out that
the 'guiding counselor' of
progressive education is
expected to keep "confidential"
files. Any student
with one ounce of imagination
will find it hard to
resist the temptation to
"goof" the files and give
"guidance" a rating of
zero."
