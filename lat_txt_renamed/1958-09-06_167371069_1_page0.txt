RAYMOND MOLEY:
GOP Finds Its Grip
on Vermont Slipping
MONTPELIER, Vt. —
Beginning in 1854, when
the Republican Party first
had a candidate for President,
Vermont without a
break has given its electoral
vote to the GOP.
Prior to 1928 the Republican
majority was generally
three or four to one.
But the beginning of a
marked change in relative
party strength began with
the appearance of Alfred
E. Smith as a Presidential
candidate. While Harding
in 1920 and Coolidge in
1924 registered the customary
Republican landslides, Smith, in 1928, received
half as many votes
as Herbert Hoover. Since
then, the Democratic vote
in Presidential elections
has never gone back to its
former insignificance.
★
The same change is notable
in elections for Governor.
In the past two elections
the Republican candidate
has had really formidable
opposition. But
there has been no Democratic
Governor for more
than a century. Likewise,
since popular voting for
U.S. Senator began in 1914,
Republicans have won
every time.
The Democratic upsurgence
in 1928 was in considerable
part due to the
affection in which Alfred
E. Smith was held by the
quite considerable French-
Catholic vote. And since
then these worthy people,
who are concentrated in
three counties, have continued
their Democratic
affiliation.
★
But shifts in economic
life are now having their
part in raising some doubt
about Republican assurance
of victory. Agriculture
has settled down to an
almost strictly dairy economy.
Milk, almost all of
which is shipped out of the
State, dominates Vermont’s
agriculture. Orchards, wheat and corn
fields have fallen into neglect,
and marginal farmers
present an impoverished
front.
Industry has entered
the State. From time immemorial
there have been
the big granite and marble
quarries. Later, small
industries appeared here
and there, some of them
machine tool plants in
smaller towns. And labor
unions have grown among
the workers therein. At
present it is estimated
that there are 15,000
union members in the
State, while the number of
farmers, predominantly
dairymen, is considerably
smaller.
★
Other political-economic
forces have appeared.
There is a considerable
public power sentiment in
the State, which flared
into a hot controversy
over the issue of whether
a State authority or the
private utility companies
should market St. Lawrence
power. The private
companies won that fight,
and the transmission lines
are being built and operated
by a corporation
composed of three private
companies. But the echoes
of the conflict linger on.
There is also a quite active
REA group. There
are other smaller “liberal”
groups, although the conservative
Farm Bureau
Federation counts the
membership of most farmers.
It is not clear that the
labor unions have become
activated in politics as
have those of many other
States. Perhaps the
Meany-Reuther Committee
on Political Education
has been too busy elsewhere
to put pressure into
Vermont.
★
The voting record of
Sen. George D. Aiken reflects
this transition. While
he is popular among the
farmers, his votes have
been cast for most labor-
favored and public-power-
sponsored issues in
the Senate. The votes of
Winston L. Prouty, as the
State’s only member of the
House of Representatives,
have been fairly consistent
with those of Aiken.
Prouty is running in the
primary for the Senatorial
nomination to fill the vacancy
created by the retirement
of Sen. Flanders.
He is opposed by Lee E.
Emerson, a conservative
who was elected Governor
in 1950 and 1952. This contest
will be decided on
Tuesday.
Vermont may stick to
the GOP this year, but its
future will bear watching.
