RICHMOND
EDITORIAL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Those of us who write
for the press are neces-
sarily handicapped, so far
as style and rationale are
concerned, by the immedi-
acy of the issues which we
discuss and also by the
speed with which we must
meet deadlines. Not often
are our offerings worthy
of permanent note. But
once in a long while the
press produces basic phi-
losophy clothed in classic
phrases.

One such instance was
an editorial which ap-
peared in the Richmond
(Va.) News-Leader under
the title, "Why the Fight
Goes On." It was inserted
in the Congressional Rec-
ord by Sen. Byrd. Its au-
thor is James J. Kil-
patrick, whose book, "The
Sovereign States," is itself
a classic statement of the
South's position in the
present constitutional
crisis. Here is a quotation
which fairly characterizes
the entire editorial:

"What is the State fight-
ing for?
â˜…
"Three things. (1) To
preserve a constitutional
position that ought never
to be voluntarily surren-
dered. (2) To preserve the
ethnic and social structure
of the South against
forces that would destroy
it. (3) To preserve the
greatest possible educa-
tional opportunities for
children, white and Negro
alike.

"Those are the State's
aims. They are the only
aims. But it should be un-
derstood that meeting
those aims demands a
great deal of the people of
Virginia. We are asked to
rise above those interests
which are present, con-
crete and immediate, and
to dedicate ourselves in-
stead to goals that, to a
degree, are abstract and
remote. We are asked to
think earnestly upon the
Constitution of the United
States and the structure of
the American republic,
and these are big things,
hard to catch hold of...
The constitutional position
taken by Virginia is sim-
ple, direct, unambiguous.

"Virginia entered the
Union in 1788, at a time
when she could have re-
mained forever apart, up-
on certain clear under-
standings: This was to be
a Federal union of
sovereign States, in which
the States would delegate
certain limited powers to
the Federal government
they were creating; all oth-
er powers, apart from
those prohibitions to the
States by the Constitution
itself, were to be retained
by the States individually.
This structure of the
Union was in no way al-
tered by the war of 1861-
63.

"After the war, when
the 14th Amendment was
forced upon the South,
northern legislators in-
quired what effect the
amendment would have
upon the maintenance by
the States of racially sep-
arate schools. Proponents
of the amendment agreed
that the amendment was
not intended to prohibit
this power to the States:
the power therefore was to
be reserved to them.

"Virginia's position is
not limited to the school
matter only. If the court
may usurp power so dras-
tically in this instance, we
have said, then the court
may usurp power in every
instance. The concept of a
Federal union of States
held together by checks
and balances will be lost
altogether. This con-
stitutional fight is of
primary importance. It
must not be abandoned."
