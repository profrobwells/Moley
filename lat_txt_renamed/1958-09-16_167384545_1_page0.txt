The speech of Vice-Pres-
ident Richard M. Nixon at
the 50th anniversary con-
ference of the Harvard
Business School deserves
very careful examination,
It is a calculated, notable
expression of the economic
philosophy of the man who
seems destined to repre-
sent his party in the next
Presidential campaign and
who, after the election this
year, must provide some
sort of rallying point for
a badly shaken Republican
Party.
Mr. Nixon noted that he
was in his speech offering
certain suggestions not as
administrative policy but
as "areas that should have
top priority for considera-
tion by the administration
and the Congress in its
next session."

By way of explaining
his proposals, he made this
basic point:
"Let us understand
once and for all that 'busi-
ness is the people. The
people own it. And their
ownership is becoming
ever more widely dif-
fused. They make their
living out of business.
They depend on business
for progress, for opportu-
nity, for their mutual well-
being and for the develop-
ment and production of the
military equipment which
shields the nation against
aggression.
"Prosperity for the
American people is in-
separable from prosperity
for American business.
We cannot raise the floor
of security unless we raise
the ceiling of opportunity.
The best way for the
American people to im-
prove their living stand-
ards is through policies
that promote maximum
business growth.
"In summary, we must
not allow the fear of a
temporary budget deficit
to put us in a strait jacket
which will keep us from
doing what we ought to do
to insure economic
growth. Our goal should
be to fashion a tax struc-
ture which will create
more jobs, more income
and more genuine secu-
ity."
He then specifically pro-
posed a series of tax re-
The Vice-President
visions to stimulate invest-
ment rather than, as so
many of the "liberals"
would have it, to put
purchasing power into the
hands of the people in
lower incomes.
"In the area of personal
income," he said, "the al-
most confiscatory rates in
the highest brackets stifle
and prevent risk taking
and encourage tax avoid-
ance devices. The small
loss of revenue caused by
some reduction of these
rates would inevitably be
offset by the new invest-
ment and business expan-
sion which would result."
Investment in job-pro-
ducing activities would, he
said, be also promoted by
"downward adjustments
in business taxes." And
there are "strong reasons
to believe that the stimu-
lating effects of even a
small cut in the corporate
tax rate of 32's would lead
to more rather than less
revenue."
The Vice-President is
too intelligent not to re-
alize that in "liberal" cir-
cles in Congress as well as
in the universities this is
regarded as heresy. But
it is basic if we are to
draw the line between the
needs for investment and
the endless taxation of
venture capital for indis-
crimate handouts.

This speech offers some-
thing that the President
has failed to make clear
after nearly six years in
office. It is true that the
President has approached
the subject of taxation in
much the same terms as
the Vice-President from
time to time. But the con-
cessions he has made to
the opposition and the
various measures he has
sponsored or reluctantly
approved as they have
come from Congress have
blurred the Republican
picture and left his party
divided and confused.
The mission of the Vice-
President to provide a
philosophy for his party
overshadows his own in-
terests in the 1960 nomina-
tion. Whatever comes of
that goal is less important
than to provide for this
country a clearly specified
alternative to the present
point of view of the dom-
inant "liberalism" of the
Democratic Party. Without
such an alternative, Amer-
ican voters will drift into
dangerous indifference.
