RAYMOND MOLEY:
Lament of Eggheads
on Political Neglect
In the current number
of that faint voice of the
left, the New Republic,
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. de-
plores the tendency of
practical politicians in the
Democratic Party to slight
or ignore self-styled intel-
lectuals.
This neglect, we may as-
sume, is of recent origin.
For with Adlai Stevenson,
himself a sort of amateur
egghead, the ivy halls
were combed for helpers
in speech writing and oth-
er chores. While I cannot
agree with Schlesinger's
political ideas, he is a man
of sincerity and has been
a constructive critic of his
party's recent doings.
In the present article he
says: "What makes this
Democratic turn more
ironic is that it comes at a
time when the rest of the
nation is belatedly
awakening to the desper-
ate need for new ideas, for
intelligence, for leader-
ship in our public life."
Let us consider these
three needs-and they are
real needs in both political
parties.
What "new ideas" have
been provided by the or-
ganization that certainly
has no lack of academic
brains—the Americans for
Democratic Action? Its
program is nothing but
more of what all dissent-
ing groups have been ad-
vocating for half a century.
Hardly a single item in its
agenda was missing from
the Progressive Party plat-
form of 1912. In that catch-
all of the radical ideas of
the "progressive" age
were: more Federal pow-
er (Theodore Roosevelt's
new nationalism), injec-
tions of Socialism, busi-
ness regulation and wel-
farism. That orange was
squeezed dry more than
20 years ago. The New
Deal was little more than
T.R. reincarnated.
We do need new ideas—
ideas created in line with
the new civilization and
the new constituency that
have followed the second
world war. The people
Schlesinger is proposing
for "leadership" offer us
little but the stale dregs of
a past that Americans un-
der 45 never knew. One
of those who might have
been one of them, Morti-
mer Adler of the Fund for
the Republic, is keen
enough in his book "The
Idea of Freedom" to re-
pudiate Socialism as inimi-
cal to individual freedom
and progress.
We need "intelligence,"
too, in party affairs. I won-
der if as really intelligent a
man as Schlesinger is not
identifying "intelligence"
with book learning and
academic status. I earned
and had the chevrons ac-
corded those who make a
living in academic life. But
I paused for a spell in po-
litical politics to learn rath-
er than to teach. And I
learned that people in poli-
tics, while they seldom can
describe how they operate,
are highly intelligent about
the subtleties of human na-
ture.

Later I learned that in
that other world of busi-
ness there were organizing
skill and know-how un-
dreamed of by so-called in-
tellectuals. The disaster ex-
perienced by the British
Labor Party in six years of
grappling with the prob-
lems of an operating gov-
ernment should be a lesson
for Socialistic reformers.
Michael Foote, one of those
British "intellectuals," now
wails that there is no long-
er a Labor Party.
So far as leadership is
concerned, we certainly
need it. But the great con-
servative middle class of
Britain learned after six
years that a group that
aspired to lead before it
learned to serve efficiently
was worse than no leader-
ship at all. There are times
in running a government
when it is better not to do
than to do. And there are
little, simple matters like
the law of supply and de-
mand that have a perverse
way of serving better than
planning from the seats of
public authority. There is
plenty to do, but it must
be done by people who un-
derstand and can guide
new forces and conditions.
To use an old chestnut,
the expert serves best on
tap than on top in politics.
The academic and the
"intellectual" can lead, but
he must first learn to serve.
Perhaps that is what was
meant by two repudiations
of Adlai Stevenson—a Ste-
venson surrounded on all
sides by the atmosphere of
a "brave new world."
