RAYMOND MOLEY:
State Legislatures
and Reapportionment
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I assume that whoever
reads this piece knows the
names or, as in one State
the name, of his representatives in the State Legis-
lature. But I suggest that
the reader ask the first
friend the question and
ponder a bit about the answer. It will probably be
"no."
These forgotten people
and the candidates who are
running against them are
most important this year
and in 1960. For after the
census of 1960 there will
be a very considerable
overhauling of the apportionment among the States
of members of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
In almost every case where
there is a change in the
number, it will be necessary to redraw the boundaries of the Congressional
districts. And as every
American knows, some
very queer tricks can be
done by gerrymandering.
The Census Bureau estimates that the following
States will gain House
members: California 7,
Florida 3, Michigan 2,
Texas 2, Alaska 1, Arizona
1, Indiana 1, Maryland 1,
Ohio 1, Oregon 1.
★
The seats thus gained
will be taken from the following States: New York
3, Pennsylvania 3, Arkansas 2, Massachusetts 2,
Alabama 1, Georgia 1, Illinois 1, Iowa 1, Kansas 1,
Maine 1, Minnesota 1, Mississippi 1, North Carolina
1, West Virginia 1.
Since the control of the
various Legislatures involved will have such a
great bearing on the political and ideological
character of Congress,
wise people are giving
more attention than ever
to the campaign and elections of members of the
Legislature. Among those
worldly-wise who are looking to that matter of political advantage are the
leaders of the politically
dedicated labor unions.
For they are determined
to do everything they can
to have a House of Representatives which will pass
no legislation that they
oppose. They have almost
that sort of U.S. Senate
now, judging by the votes
in the recently adjourned
Congress. It is the House
which concerns them
most, the House that
blocked their Kennedy-
Ives bill.
And so in addition to
giving generously of time
and manpower to candidates for the U.S. Senate
and House whom they favor, they are striving in
every State to assure the
election of their favorites
for seats in the State Legislatures. Those members
are elected for the most
part in districts. That
means working at the local level. Providing propaganda, acquainting voters
with the candidates, planning to put thousands of
workers into registration
efforts, and at election to
mobilize thousands of
automobiles over the nation to get their vote to
the polls. No such effort is
being made by the regulars in the old parties.
They have neither the
workers, the money nor
the cars to commandeer.
★
Consider, if you are of a
conservative turn of mind,
the States in which the
gains and losses enumerated above appear. By a simple process of gerrymandering, Legislatures in the
States which will lose
House members can oust
conservatives and replace
them with "liberals." In
States which gain members it will be possible to
make net gains for the
cause. In States like Mississippi, Kansas and Iowa
the loss is almost certain
to be the loss of a conservative. Maybe in Maine also.
And possibly in Massachusetts, North Carolina and
Minnesota. In New York
the Legislature is likely
to be Republican and conservative as in the past.
But with big gains in
California (the Legislature
is about evenly divided
now after steady conservative losses for several
years) and in Michigan,
Oregon and possibly Florida, enough House seats
may be turned to assure a
liberal-labor balance in the
House for years.
This is something every
citizen should ponder as
election nears.
