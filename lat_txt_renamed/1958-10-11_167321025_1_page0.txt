RAYMOND MOLEY:
Dangerous Spending
Plans of Democrats
In a preceding column
I pointed out that the
Democratic State Conven-
tion in August adopted a
platform which it was
sought to keep under
cover as long as possible.
Finally, after numerous
leaks and much prodding
by the press, the party is-
sued it in printed form.
This document is not in
the tradition of party plat-
forms which call for long,
discursive elaborations of
nothings. It is a specific
program embodying the
purposes of the labor-
union leaders who domi-
nate the Democratic Party
in California.
Moreover, if Gubernato-
rial Candidate Brown wins
there will also be elected
a Legislature dominated
by the same interests and
the State may anticipate
the adoption of a substan-
tial part of this program.
Indeed, the Legislature is
already evenly divided
since over the past 10
years the labor-union ma-
chine, very powerful out
here, has aimed at its con-
trol and has made sub-
stantial gains.,

In. my preceding piece
I described two of the
major provisions of that
platform. The first is the
Walter Reuther formu-
la to establish a govern-
ment boycott on goods
produced by any firm
"charged" with unfair la-
bor practices and also
against a producer against
whom a strike has been
called. Its tax provisions
would cut and ultimately
abolish the sales tax and
put the increased burden
on State income and cor-
poration taxes. The enor-
mity of this revolutionary
overhauling of taxes be-
comes apparent when the
present State expendi-
tures are calculated and
the effects of new spend-
ing programs advocated
in the platform are ap-
praised.
Here irresponsibility is
equally flagrant. There is
a State medical-care and
hospital-insurance plan, an
old scheme to open the
door to governmentaliz-
ing the medical profes-
sion; increased State old-
age pensions and a lower
age limit, Federal legisla-
tion to permit pensioners
to earn more, without de-
ductions from their bene-
fits; unemployment com-
pensation raised to 65%
of a worker's wage, plus
an additional $5 a week
for at least 39 weeks. It
has been pointed out that
this would enable an un-
employed worker with
five children to get a big-
ger income without work-
ing than by getting a
new job.
★
Very significant is a
provision calling for the
repeal of present legisla-
tion placing some respon-
sibility upon children able
to contribute to the sup-
port of needy parents.
This provision is charac-
teristic of the whole wel-
fare program embodied in
this platform. It means
that personal, individual,
moral responsibility for
those of one's own flesh
and blood embedded by
Providence in all human
beings must be engulfed
in a messy generality,
called by eggheads "so-
cial responsibility."
And all these at a stag-
gering cost dumped upon
a tax system cunningly
designed to extinguish
the right of a man to the
product of his own hands
and brain. A scheme
which as certain as any-
thing in the world would
throttle production, which
must be depended upon to
provide a better life for
all.
*
The general trend of all
these so-called welfare re-
forms advocated in this
platform is to destroy the
distinction between those
who legitimately need
help and the host that
merely want it. Our eco-
nomic system is rich
enough to care for needs
but no system can meet
all wants. Moreover, the
vice in such a scheme for
indiscriminate help is that
those who really need will
be the first to suffer. The
British system of univer-
sal medical and hospital
service has left those who
were being helped be-
cause of need in a more
critical position. There
simply isn't enough to
spread the butter over all
the bread.
