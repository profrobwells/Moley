RAYMOND MOLEY:
What to Expect From
the Next Congress
To anticipate the gen-
eral tone of legislation in
the next Congress, a mat-
ter which concerns all of
us, it is more important to
examine the personal com-
position of the various
committees than to count
over-all Democratic and
Republican members.
And since a committee
chairman has immense
power in his committee
and on the floor, in bills
that are in the jurisdiction
of his committee, it is very
important to note who he
may be.
Committee power is es-
pecially notable in the
House. Very little is decid-
ed on the floor. Power lies
with those who decide
what gets to the floor.
The comments that fol-
low are made on the as-
sumption that both houses
will be Democratic in the
80th Congress, a predic-
tion which no realistic Re-
publican will publicly
deny. In naming the prob-
able chairmen of the im-
portant committees I in-
dicate my estimate of their
ideological slant—whether
conservative, moderate or
liberal.
★
The word "liberal" is
used in the sense in which
these people know them-
selves. They generally
vote for greater extension
of Federal authority, for
more spending, for more
Federal regulation of pri-
vate business and for the
enlargement of govern-
ment in business. This is,
of course, not liberal in the
true historical sense. But
since they have stolen the
word I use it to identify
them.
In the Senate the impor-
tant, decisive committees
are Agriculture, Appro-
priations, Armed Services,
Banking and Currency,
Finance, Foreign Rela-
tions, Government Opera-
tions, Interior and Insular
Affairs, Judiciary and La-
bor.
★
In the Senate Commit-
tee on Agriculture, the
chairman—barring death
or resignation—will be El-
lender of Louisiana. He is
a conservative Democrat.
There is likely to be little
change in the personnel of
that committee as a result
of the election.
In Appropriations, the
chairman is Hayden of
Arizona, veteran of around
fourscore. Pretty liberal
in spending. Moderate in
other issues.
Armed Services has Rus-
sell of Georgia, basically
conservative in all ways.
Very able in military mat-
ters. Not much change in
committee.
Banking and Currency
has Fulbright of Arkan-
sas, moderately liberal.
Not much change in com-
mittee,
In Finance there is Byrd
of Virginia. Enough said.
But most of his Democrat-
ic colleagues are liberal,
some extreme. Republican
members are solid folk—
like Byrd.
Foreign Relations is
headed by Green, four-
score and ten. Fulbright
is heir apparent. Commit-
tee mostly strongly inter-
nationalist.
Government Operations:
McClellan, conservative.
Membership strongly con-
servative and fairly able.
Interior is headed by
Murray of Montana. Com-
mittee, on both sides of
political fence and with
one exception from recla-
mation States, favors big
spending for Federal proj-
ects.
★
Judiciary is very im-
portant. Eastland is very
conservative; his commit-
tee moderate.
Labor: Hill of Alabama,
very liberal. Committee
mostly the same.
In the House, the im-
portant committees are
Agriculture, Appropria-
tions, Armed Services,
Banking and Currency, In-
terior, Judiciary, Labor
and, above all, the Rules
Committee.
The House Agriculture
Committee chairman will
be Cooley of North Caro-
lina, who votes generally
moderately conservative.
Appropriations is head-
ed by Cannon of Missouri,
fairly liberal.
Armed Services, Vinson
of Georgia—respected and
able, with conservative
voting record.
Banking and Currency,
Spence of Kentucky, very
liberal.
★
Education and Labor,
Barden of North Carolina,
conservative. Powell of
New York ranks, so ask
many happy returns for
Barden.
Government Operations,
Dawson of Illinois, very
liberal.
Interior, Aspinall of Col-
orado, liberal spender.
Most of committee from
beneficiary States but
some solid on spending and
other matters.
Judiciary: Celler of New
York, very liberal.
Rules, from a conserva-
tive standpoint, the
brightest spot in the
House. Smith of Virginia,
chairman, speaks for him-
self. But he will lose two
solid conservatives.
Thus, assured re-elec-
tions over the years, with
seniority promotions, make
the committees more con-
servative than the gener-
ality of the membership of
the houses. Here will be
some element of cheer for
conservatives as liberal
victories roll in at election
time.
