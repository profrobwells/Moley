In Edgar Lee Masters'
lasting and inspired com-
mentary on human life,
"The Spoon River Anthol-
ogy," these lines appear:
The earth keeps some
vibrations going
There in your heart,
and that is you.
If a man is fitted by his
nature for a certain serv-
ice, and when there is dire
need for that service, cir-
cumstances have their way
with him. He becomes the
subject of inexorable pre-
ordination. Only an irra-
tional stubbornness may
restrain him.

With Richard Nixon, le-
gitimate ambition runs
parallel with circum-
stances beyond himself.
These forces make him the
almost certain nominee of
his party for the Presi-
dency in 1960 and propel
him into the vacuum cre-
ated by the President's lost
leadership.
No such predetermina-
tion has affected the des-
tiny of a national figure in
this country for two or
three generations. And
Democrats, with half a
dozen hopefuls and a di-
vided party, despite an
exhilarating victory in the
election just ahead may
find the 1960 Nixon a more
formidable opponent than
they have met since their
much more divided and
scanty army met in 1904.
That this fact is well
within the consciousness
of Democratic leaders,
such as that old craftsman
Harry S. Truman, is
shown by the hysterical
hatred they feel for the
Vice-President and the
screams they direct at
him.
★
No one, except those
very close to Nixon, real-
izes the conflicting forces
and impulses which have
troubled his decisions in
the past three years—
roughly since the Presi-
dent's heart attack in 1955.
On the one hand there
has been the tradition that
the Vice-President remain
an impotent Throttlebot-
tom, speaking only
through parliamentary
rulings in the Senate and
in spongy generalities at
the dedication of soldiers'
homes. There was also
loyalty to the man, whom
he truly loves and re-
spects, who made him
Vice-President.
On the other hand there
was his keen concept of
the nation's needs and the
inadequacy of the Presi-
dent, and of those whom
he chose to surround him-
self, to understand and
meet those needs. Fore-
most among those needs
was and is a strong two-
party system with a po-
tent, active Republican or-
ganization with a clear
philosophy and identity.
Through many months
in 1956, Nixon was tor-
tured by the vacillation of
the President with respect
to a renomination of his
running mate. Nixon chose
the wise course of silence
while his enemies labored
to capture the President's
mind. Only the over-
whelming demands of
party leaders over the
country, subtly influenced
by Republican Chairman
Len Hall, determined the
President's reluctant ac-
quiescence.
★
As the face of the Eisen-
hower administration came
to be more and more
amorphous and leadership
failed after the inaugura-
tion in 1957, the demands
upon Nixon to take the
leadership of the party be-
came more and more in-
sistent. The retirement of
Len Hall and cordial dis-
like of Sherman Adams
made this demand much
greater.
As the Congressional
elections of this year ap-
proached, the deterioration
of the party organization
became desperate. All over
the country, Senators,
Congressmen, and Gover-
nors who were up for re-
election were crying out.
Some chose to ignore the
Eisenhower administration
and go their own way.
Regular contributors to
the party shrugged off the
solicitations of the nation-
al committee. The poli-
cies of the administration
toward legislation before
Congress wobbled and
wavered.
★
It is folly to say that the
Eisenhower administration
prevented reckless and
ruinous spending. So far
as savings were made, the
credit goes to a small
coalition of southern
Democrats and conserva-
tive Republicans who
stemmed the tide to a de-
gree. The President's veto
power was only casually
used.
Finally, as this cam-
paign has progressed, Nix-
on has emerged. The die is
cast. He is on his own, and
the vast labor of rallying
a defeated and disorgan-
ized party lies ahead for
two years to come.
