RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nelson. Rockefeller
and N.Y. Republicans
When Vice-President
Nixon visited New York
City last week Nelson
Rockefeller, candidate for
Governor on the Republi-
can ticket, was conspicu-
ous by his absence from
the rally.
Nixon, who is laboring
to arouse all Republicans
in the campaign, cordially
invited the reluctant
Rockefeller to breakfast
the next morning. Pictures
were taken and published
showing the New Yorker
expounding something or
other, with Nixon a smil-
ing but quiet listener.
*
Then there were state-
ments by both in which
Rockefeller expressed the
view, not quite original,
that Nixon was doing a
good job rallying Repub-
licans to the party's cause.
Nixon indicated no disap-
pointment at Rockefeller's
absence the evening be-
fore, noting that after all
his guest was running for
Governor on State issues.
No sophisticated politi-
cian was deluded by these
pleasantries.
The Rockefeller absence
from the Nixon meeting
was not an accident. It was
deliberately planned well
in advance. The group that
promoted the Rockefeller
debut in politics has fol-
lowed a policy of disasso-
ciating its man from the
Republican Party.
*
Gov. Averell Harriman,
who is getting some of his
own publicity brewed
medicine in his campaign
for re-election, has com-
mented in speeches that
his opponent really is a
Republican and don't let
him fool you. This is rem-
iniscent of Jimmy Roose-
velt's breathless announce-
ment, when he was run-
ning for Governor in Cal-
ifornia in 1950, that while
he did not want to make
it "a dirty campaign," he
would, before election,
prove that Earl Warren
was really a Republican,
however he might disguise
that damning fact.
The excuse for such non-
partisanship as was dis-
played by Earl Warren and
is now presented by Rocke-
feller's people is the great
predominance of Demo-
cratic registrations in both
States. This disparity be-
tween the registrations of
the two parties is accentu-
ated and augmented by
just such policies as have
been characteristic of War-
ren's and Rockefeller's
campaigns. It takes the
heart out of those devoted
few who believe in party
government and who will,
if encouraged, work to in-
crease registration. For
anyone who knows politics
at the precinct level real-
izes that to get voters reg-
istered is a matter of great
and continuing labor.

The disdain, amounting
to contempt for the Repub-
lican Party organization by
Rockefeller's handlers—
for this political novice is
the product of an expen-
sive, high-powered group
of hucksters—is not unno-
ticed by the district lead-
ers, and workers in New
York City. I know a good
many of them well and
have talked with them
within the past few days.
They are enraged at the
Rockefeller disdain for the
other Republicans on the
ticket with him—for the
little fellows such as can-
didates for the State As-
sembly and State Senate.
An organization known
as Citizens for Rockefeller
seems to be running his
campaign. It is apparent-
ly lavishly supplied with
money. This organization
has opened up stores all
over the city for the pro-
mulgation of the Rocke-
feller gospel. In one in-
stance, a store was opened
up almost across the street
from the residence of a
candidate for a high State
office, who has been a
loyal party worker for
years. This man tried to
have the Citizens for Rock-
efeller accept his own lit-
erature for distribution
and his picture for dis-
play. He was flatly refused.
*
All this is a repetition
of the disastrous Willkie
blitz, which nominated but
could not elect its man,
and also the Eisenhower
blitz which rejected Taft
in 1952. In this group are
many of the same people
who participated then—
furnishing man and wom-
an power and lots of
money.
As might be, should a
victory for Rockefeller be
the result here, as sure as
death and dissolution
there will be a Rockefel-
ler blitz for 1960. This
the Republicans in other
States should know. They
have had similar collisions
in the past. It may hap-
pen again.
