Why U.S. Ships Sail
Under Foreign Flags
In a previous column I
discussed the size and im-
portance of the American-
owned and American-con-
trolled fleet of cargo ships
which are registered under
the flags of friendly na-
tions such as Liberia and
Panama. I also pointed out
the bitter hostility to this
kind of shipping by the
British, the Norwegians
and the international
maritime unions. The
need for such a constantly
growing and renewed
fleet, should war come to
us, hardly needs to be dem-
onstrated.
It is an axiom of the
principles of wartime
strength that great naval
power is dependent upon a
strong merchant marine
engaged in peacetime in
vigorous and healthy com-
merce. A stand-by fleet is
as perishable as a barrel
of apples.

After more than a cen-
tury during which the
American merchant ma-
rine had a proud place in
the world’s commerce, we
turned after the Civil
War to the development
of our inland empire, and
the British and Scandina-
vian ships supplied our
foreign commerce. Hence,
in both the first and sec-
ond world wars we were
caught unprepared. In
both instances there was
wasteful, hysterical ship-
building which consumed
not only vast sums of
money but a toil of man-
power which was thus
denied to the firing lines.
Moreover, the great major-
ity of emergency ships
thus built were only par-
tially suitable for com-
mercial use after the wars
were over.
★
At the moment our war-
built ships are reaching
a dangerous obsolescence.
The 14 shipping compa-
nies having subsidy con-
tracts with the govern-
ment have prudently em-
barked on a program to
replace nearly 300 vessels
over the next 10 or 15
years. This will cost—in-
cluding subsidies, which
are largely recovered in
taxes and repayment—
about 4 billion dollars.
In today’s market a ship
costing $10,000,000 to
build in the United States
can be built abroad for
about $4,500,000. The op-
erating differential in the
subsidy now runs about
$120,000,000 annually.
Most of this goes into sea-
men’s wages, for these
ships must run in compe-
tition with low-cost and
lower-wage foreign ships.
But despite subsidies,
these ships under the
American Flag are not in-
tended to meet the special
needs of our nation for
transportation of great
bulk loads of ores and pe-
troleum, for example, di-
rect from their sources of
supply. It is important to
note that so far as raw
materials are concerned
the United States must
import more than it ex-
ports. For the first time in
a century Britain is ex-
porting more than it im-
ports.
★
To attempt to provide
an American-flag fleet
adequate to meet our raw
material needs through
subsidy of high construc-
tion and operating costs
would require an outlay of
Federal funds which Con-
gress would never appro-
priate. For it would be an
astronomical sum.
National security and,
indeed, survival therefore
require some other means
of providing American-
owned cargo ships. This
imperative need is met by
American-owned and
American-controlled ships
registered under flags of
nations which are not
only friendly but relatively
dependent upon us eco-
nomically. Liberia and
Panama fit that descrip-
tion. In fact, the United
States played a major role
in the creation of both na-
tions.
These ships would be
available to the United
States in case of war;
they can operate in inter-
national commerce at a
cost which permits com-
petition with our maritime
rivals, and their operation
permits the accumulation
of funds for necessary new
construction.
★
In addition to providing
relief from high labor
costs, there are other fiscal
factors which make these
registries attractive. Pana-
ma officials have pointed
out that they can offer a
currency which is at a
point of stability with the
dollar; they do not create
obstacles designed to cor-
ner profits through ex-
change restrictions, and
there are no unreasonable
registration charges. Libe-
rian laws permit the same
kind of advantage.
The United States Treas-
ury is not only relieved
from immense subsidies,
but it collects taxes from
Americans who build and
operate these ships.
