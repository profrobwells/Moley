RAYMOND MOLEY:
Why a Labor Party?
Democrats Will Do
It has been asserted
over and over by Walter
Reuther that he wants no
labor party in this coun-
try. But there can be no
doubt about his determi-
nation and that of other
politically minded union
leaders to achieve a labor
government or a workable
facsimile thereof.
Their desire to avoid
the name while achieving
the substance is under-
standable. By taking over
the control of the Demo-
cratic Party, they will
profit by an old trade
name and also by the
votes of many who vote
for that party because of
long-established tradi-
tion, and by many sup-
porters who are unable to
understand what is hap-
pening to their party.
I have done a bit of
preliminary research con-
cerning the identity of
the next Senate with the
ideas and aspiration of the
unions' political arm,
AFL-CIO COPE. Here are
some results.
★
For this campaign,
COPE published in innu-
merable numbers a book-
let entitled "How Your
Senators and Representa-
tives Voted, 1957-1958." It
first lists the key roll calls
which COPE regards as
the test of fealty to its
objectives. There are 16
such test votes for Sena-
tors and 13 for the House
of Representatives.
Then every Senator and
Representative in the
1957-58 Congress is list-
ed by State. Votes on
each of the issues in-
volved are listed as
"right" or "wrong." Here
are the records of those
who followed the COPE
line. This simply means
that, despite their nomi-
nal membership in the
Democratic Party, they
are the reliable hard core
of labor membership.
Members of the last
Congress who will be
there in the next one are,
with their COPE score:
Clark, 16-0; Carroll, 15-0;
Douglas, 16-0; Kennedy,
15-0; McNamara, 16-0;
Humphrey, 14-0; Syming-
ton, 16-0; Hennings, 15-0;
Neuberger, 16-0; Pastore,
16-0; Jackson, 16-0; Prox-
mire, 12-0.
The following deviated
once: Murray, 13-1; Morse,
15-1; Kefauver, 15-1; Mag-
nuson, 13-1; Church 12-1.
The following deviated
two to four times: Hill,
13-3; Sparkman, 13-3; Hay-
den, 10-4; Long, 10-4;
Mansfield, 14-2; Chavez,
12-2; Anderson, 10-3; Kerr,
12-4; Monroney, 9-3;
Green, 14-2; Johnston of
South Carolina, 12-4; Gore,
6-2; Johnson of Texas,
13-3; O'Mahoney, 8-2.
Thus, 31 Democrats
have conformed to the
COPE measurement. They
were aided by what may
be called COPElicans—Re-
publicans who also con-
formed: Smith of Maine,
13-3; Payne, 10-4; Thye,
10-3; Case of New Jersey,
12-4; Javits, 12-3. Since
three of these will be in
the new Senate, there will
be a group of 34 COPE
reliables.
On the Democratic side,
there remain to be consid-
ered the 12 newly elected
members of that party.
Five of these have had
records in the House
which COPE evaluated.
Their COPE score is: En-
gle, 12-1; McCarthy, 13-0;
Byrd of West Virginia, 9-4.
Williams of New Jersey
and Dodd were not mem-
bers of the 1957-58 Con-
gress, but their previous
record in the 1956 COPE
book, which covered 10
years, was 7-1 and 7-2 re-
spectively. They were not
in the House all 10 years;
hence their scores were
only on the years they
were there.
★
Since most of the re-
maining seven new Sena-
tors had the ardent sup-
port of COPE in the cam-
paign, it seems fair to as-
sume, at a minimum that
five will respond to the
COPE line.
That adds up, so far as
Democrats are concerned,
to 41 COPE reliables. This
is a good majority of the
Democrats in the next
Senate. Two more to come
from Alaska may well be
Democrats.
Of the three new Re-
publicans elected this
year, the score of Scott in
the House was 8-4, on the
COPE side. Prouty's score
in the House was 8-5.
Keating was 5-8. Thus,
there is a prospect of two
more fairly regular COPE-
licans.
From this it may be in-
ferred that labor legisla-
tion and big spending
will be pretty much as
COPE wants them. Why
should union leaders want
a labor party?
