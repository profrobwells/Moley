THE MOST IMPORTANT
OF AUDITORS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The newspapers have
given full and excellent
treatment to the report
by Comptroller General
Joseph Campbell, head of
the General Accounting
Office, on the unbelievable
mess made by our Interna-
tional Co-operation Ad-
ministration in the King-
dom of Laos. A careful
reading of this report,
which is clear, dispassion-
ate, documented, and dev-
astating, almost drives one
to describe the situation in
Laos by using the obvious
pun.
The reader will ask,
"Will something be done
about it?" The answer is
yes. Something will be
done about Laos. This is
too terrible to ignore. To
clear the way for another
big appropriation for for-
eign aid, concentrated ef-
forts will be made to clean
up this one sad piece of
bungling.

It will also be said by
apologists in the govern-
ment, who will be appear-
ing before Congressional
committees to ask for an-
other whacking vote of
money, that the case of
Laos is exceptional. It is
a small, remote kingdom
in what was French Indo-
China. It is extremely
primitive, hard to reach,
and inhabited by people
who are, to say the least,
unaccustomed to the in-
dependent administration
of their affairs. But the
Comptroller General has
made other reports over a
considerable period of time
on other situations into
which foreign aid money
is being poured. He has
been standing against a
tide of bureaucratic bun-
gling, doing his duty as no
other man who has held
that office has ever done it.
It is of importance to
look at the background
and powers of this office.
For it is about the only
protection that the taxpay-
er is going to have in the
stampede for spending
that lies ahead. This man,
Joseph Campbell, is the
best of all who have held
the office since it was cre-
ated 38 years ago. As
originally created, it was
to be much more than a
mere auditing affair,
checking on the millions
of expenditures made
under Congressional ap-
propriations. It had the
authority to dig deeply
into the executive depart-
ment and make reports to
Congress—critical reports
—and to make recommen-
dations for improvement.
To remove the Comp-
troller General from po-
litical control and to
protect him from control
by the President — any
President — his term was
for 15 years. Essentially,
he is an agency to help
Congress perform its con-
stitutional duty of check-
ing on the executive.
Comptrollers before
Campbell have been
swamped by the job of
auditing millions and
millions of government
checks, with an occasional
disallowance. But Camp-
bell has gone to the root
of trouble and through
some of his reports has
tried to get the barn door
locked before the horse
has been stolen.
His independence of the
executive is acknowledged
in what is revealed in this
report because his em-
ployees were denied access
to certain information on
the ground that it was
limited only to the execu-
tive branch of government.

In this report on Laos
there is the account of
quantities of motor vehi-
cles dumped into the coun-
try before the highways to
accommodate them had
been built; much expensive
planning for a new airport
before it was decided that
the old one, with improve-
ments, would be more
useful; much military
equipment delivered be-
fore the Laotians could
use it, even store it; a
comical and expensive ef-
fort to create a police force
on western lines; confu-
sion among contractors,
and other doings.
But a great amount of
information about other
inexcusable waste and in-
competence has already
been placed before Con-
gress by the Comptroller
General and by the inde-
fatigable Sen. Ellender,
who has traveled prodi-
giously among the coun-
tries involved. Still, the
administration asks for
more, and Congress goes
ahead with appropriations.
Perhaps, if you are an opti-
mist, the Laos mess will
bring to light some general
corrections to be made.
Perhaps not.
