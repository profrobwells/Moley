New light can be thrown
upon the problem of the
union shop by a case de-
cided Nov. 21 by Judge
O. L. Long in the County
Superior Court in Macon,
Ga. The distinction is
made between a union as a
political organization and
as an instrument for col-
lective bargaining.
Since the election I have
visited two of the States
in which right-to-work ref-
erendums were defeated,
Idaho and Ohio, and have
heard the story of these
campaigns from those who
were intimately connected
with them. I have also
talked with Republican
candidates who were hit
hard by the heavy union
vote brought out by the
right-to-work issue. In one
case, a candidate lost all of
his expected majority ex-
cept a narrow margin. In
the other, a man lost who
should have been a shoo
in.
It is not necessary to dis-
cuss the reasons why
right to work lost and
whether it was wise to put
it on the ballot in a year
when candidates for high
office were running. I
would suggest that the
"right" in right to work
involves two rights one
economic, the other politi-
cal. Perhaps the end to be
achieved by sponsors in
various States could be
found by splitting the two
and devising a way first
to win for all workers their
political freedom from the
injustice to which they
must submit through a
union shop under present
practices by union leaders.
The Georgia case in-
volved an action brought
by Nancy M. Looper and
other employees of certain
railroads for relief con-
cerning the use of their
union dues for political
and ideological purposes.
Under the stipulation of
facts by counsel for both
sides it was admitted, in
the words of Judge Long,
"that the periodic dues and
assessments required of
all members of the 15 rail-
way unions, defendant
unions, in order to acquire
and retain membership
have been and are being
and will be used in sub-
stantial part for the sup-
port of political candidates
locally, State wide and
for Federal offices... I
find that the dues and as-
sessments are being used
and will be used in part
to support, propagate and
foster ideological and po-
litical doctrines to which
these plantiffs do not sub-
scribe."
The judge found further
that such expenditures
were not "germane to col-
lective bargaining."
Therefore, the judge fol-
lowed the U.S. Supreme
Court's opinion in the so-
called Hanson case involv-
ing a similar problem, that
under the Federal law
membership may be re-
quired only for forcing
members to pay for collec-
tive bargaining and not for
political or ideological pur-
poses. This is explicit in
Justice Douglas' opinion
in that case.
This decision, which
will probably be supported
by the Georgia Supreme
Court in the light of an
earlier decision, strikes at
the root of the injustice in
using union dues to sup-
port candidates and po-
litical ideas which some
members do not favor. It
will be difficult indeed for
the U.S. Supreme Court to
deny such employees their
political rights in this mat-
ter.
The virtue of this sort
of approach is that it sepa-
rates the economic issues
from the political ones
and substantially elimi-
nates the "free-rider" ar-
gument, so effectively used
in the campaigns against
right-to-work proposals.
Perhaps an approach by
those who would free un-
ion members from compul-
sory membership by strik-
ing at this political angle
might be much more suc-
cessful than that which
has been taken before.
It will be necessary, of
course, to define with some
clarity what political ac-
'tivities really are. But that
is not at all difficult. For
many of these unions per-
form, in fact, all of the ac-
tivities of political parties
except the official and law-
fully defined function of
nominating candidates. All
of the other business of
politics they do openly
and most effectively.
