RAYMOND MOLEY:
Triumph for Nixon
on Visit to Britain
A week ago I indicated
in a column that Vice-
President Nixon was
facing a more formidable
ordeal in visiting the Brit-
ish than the sticks and
stones of Caracas,
This, I said, was largely
due to the distorted and
prejudiced reporting of
American political affairs
by British press represent-
atives in Washington.
These, with a bright ex-
ception or two, have por-
trayed Nixon as Demo-
cratic spokesmen such as
former President Truman
and the titular leader, Ad-
lai Stevenson, wish to
have him pictured. It is
a portrait of a man
whose professed principles
change with every breath
of opinion, whose cam-
paigning is dirty and slan-
derous and who would be
a perilous pilot of the ship
of state.
*
Perhaps British cor-
respondents in Washing-
ton—and in fairness I
must, as I have before,
note the Daily Telegraph
American writers as an ex-
ception—fail to under-
stand that this anti-Nixon
propaganda is dissemi-
nated for a practical pur-
pose. It is not because
these seasoned Democratic
political masters really ab-
hor the Vice-President. A
good many of them wish
they had in their camp as
effective a political maes-
tro as Nixon, which they
do not.
They are proceeding to
tear him down, just as
they did Taft before him,
in anticipation of 1960. In
this process they are aided
by many Park Avenue Re-
publicans such as those
who backed the Stassen
uproar in 1956. British cor-
respondents must acquire,
if possible, some sophisti-
cation so far as American
politics is concerned, and
also some conception of
the professional methods
of Democratic leaders.
*
In any event it now
seems that Nixon in Lon-
don has undone in a week
all, or mostly all, that these
writers have accomplished
in several years.
A competent American
correspondent in London,
Drew Middleton of the
New York Times, sum-
marizes the Nixon victory
this way:
"Vice-President Richard
M. Nixon, who arrived
billed as an uncouth po-
litical adventurer in the
political jungles, departed
trailing clouds of states-
manship and esteem. In
four days here filled with
opportunities for hideous
mistakes the Vice-Presi-
dent did not make a mis-
step." Middleton then ac-
knowledges the point I
made last week by noting
"the dark picture original-
ly painted by some British
reporters in the United
States."
*
The achievement of the
Vice-President, however,
was not merely that he de-
stroyed that "dark pic-
ture" of himself, which
will greatly add to his stat-
ure in American eyes al-
ways slanted sideways to
discover what the British
are thinking. He also made
a profound contribution to
unity among the western
allies and thus to our own
national security against
Communism.
There was great peril to
that firmness among the
allied countries in the face
of such Soviet threats as
are involved in the Berlin
situation because of the
overwhelming Democratic
victory at the polls last
month. There was real
danger that in Europe it
might be interpreted as a
repudiation of the Eisen-
hower-Dulles policies and
an indication that the
American people were
tired of resisting Commu-
nism.
*
Positive assurances by
Democratic leaders such as
Truman, Stevenson and
Lyndon Johnson were
needed to make plain that
we are in fact joined, re-
gardless of party, in refus-
ing to be pushed out of
Berlin. But Nixon did the
job effectively himself and
apparently with such con-
viction that the British
are more determined than
ever to stand firm against
the wiles of Khrushchev.
Also, he showed the Brit-
ish statesmen that finesse
so admired by them in
winning others with subtly
flattering expressions and
attentions. He uttered the
old cliches about "our An-
glo-Saxon heritage," etc.,
with new turns of lan-
guage. More than that,
and without conceding the
main point, he laid sooth-
ing medicine on wounds
created by many American
attacks upon British co-
lonialism.
Altogether the Vice-
President did well not only
for himself but for his
country in a short week.
