Unions Cat's-paws of
Foreign Ship Firms
A month ago I wrote
about a controversy, then
brewing, which burst
upon the scene Dec. 1.
The International Trans-
port Workers Federation
declared a boycott of ships
flying the flags of Pana-
ma, Liberia, Honduras
and Costa Rica. In sym-
pathy with this boycott,
which, it should be noted,
originated abroad and af-
fects 62 countries, was an
alliance of the National
Maritime Union and the
Seafarers International
Union, affiliates of the
AFL-CIO. Other American
unions participated.
This crisis comes as the
result of a vast propagan-
da campaign against ships
which are in very consid-
erable part American
owned.
American unions seem
to be the victims of this
foreign propaganda which
has been directed not only
against ships under the
registries of small coun-
tries friendly to the Unit-
ed States but against all
American shipping and
shipping interests. The
spokesman for British in-
terests is Robert D. Rop-
ner, president of the Brit-
ish Chamber of Shipping.
Ropner declared recently
that British shipping is
threatened by three "ene-
mies," all of which are of
American origin.
The first of these, ac-
cording to Ropner, is the
custom of registering
American-owned ships un-
der the flags of these
small countries. His sec-
ond "enemy" is the Amer-
ican law which requires
that 50% of our foreign-
aid cargoes be carried in
American ships. This law
was passed by Congress
because it believed the
simple bit of justice that
if we are giving away
something we ought at
least have it carried in
part on American ships.
The third "enemy," ac-
cording to Ropner, is the
subsidy supplied by the
American government.
It is certainly a grim re-
flection on certain Ameri-
can unions that they
should be the allies of this
sort of competition. But
some of them seem will-
ing to enter the fight
against American inter-
ests with all the vehe-
mence that has character-
ized the conduct of pre-
vious strikes and inter-
union fighting. Paul Hall,
president of the Seafarers
International Union, was
quoted in the New York
Times on Nov. 25 as say-
ing: "For years we've de-
veloped assassination tech-
niques in fights among
ourselves â€” now we're
going to put these tech-
niques to more construc-
tive use." The plain facts
show that this "more con-
structive" action is against
the economic strength and
safety of the United
States in a possible war.
The American - owned
and American - controlled
ships under "Panlibhonco"
registry, chiefly tankers
and ore carriers, aggre-
gate about 10,000,000 tons.
It would be impossible to
transfer these ships to
U.S. registry without a
subsidy from the govern-
ment which would call for
a sum so great that Con-
gress would not allow it.
Next, to drive them
from the registries of
these small nations to
British and Norwegian
registry, for instance,
would mean that they
would not be available to
the United States in case
of war. We had a bitter
lesson with respect to that
in World War I, when we
were forced to be depend-
ent upon ships of British
and other traditional mari-
time flags.
Then we were com-
pelled to rush pell-mell
into a great building pro-
gram which was not only
wasteful but slow.
The London Economist
has pointed out that "the
wages and standards of
living and accommodation
in the majority of these
ships are well known to
be above reproach." It is
also true that the Ameri-
can owners and operators
pay American taxes. Fi-
nally, a great number of
these ships are built and
serviced in the United
States, which provides
American labor with jobs.
This boycott was con-
ceived as a senseless and
dangerous attack inimical
to the true interests of
American labor and of the
United States.
