RAYMOND MOLEY:
British Conservatives
Offer Lesson to GOP
Leading Republicans,
who are already consider-
ing plans to face the 1960
elections with a recon-
structed party, have men-
tioned several times re-
cently the lessons which
could be learned from the
amazing revival of the
Conservative Party in Brit-
ain.
After the crushing de-
feat sustained in 1945, the
structure of the party was
overhauled and, to a de-
gree, rebuilt. The result
was a return to power
after six years and a state
of efficiency which would
undoubtedly win an elec-
tion now or in the months
ahead.
Republicans can learn
that a great deal of what
was done there could be
applied with some modifi-
cations here.
Many people in this
country are saying that
the Conservatives in Brit-
ain have taken over most
of the Labor Party princi-
ples and are just as devot-
ed to the welfare state as
are Socialists. Therefore,
they conclude that the Re-
publican Party, in order to
succeed, must merely
adopt the vote-catching is-
sues of the liberal Demo-
crats and of the big labor
unions. This is the pre-
scription of the "modern"
Republicans.

means that the design of
Socialism is more and
more leveling down to a
dead and lifeless conform-
ity. Conservatism is to
keep the aim always to-
ward self-help, with re-
wards for excellence.
The one leads to a vast
bureaucracy, with plan-
ning of all by the govern-
ment. The other, with cer-
tain efforts by govern-
ment to help those who
need help, keeps its eyes
toward maintaining eco-
nomic freedom of choice
and an economy held in
private hands. The sharp-
est difference between the
two parties in 1950 and
1931 was on the nation-
alization of industries.

But I am convinced, aft-
er a close watch of the
Conservative revival in
Britain since 1945 and two
visits during elections, that
the secret of the great
change is not in the realm
of policy but in organiza-
tion. The order of impor-
tance in any political party
is this: First, competent or-
ganization; second, attrac-
tive candidates; third, ide-
ology. If Republicans here
can keep that order in
mind, there is no reason
why they cannot in 1960
come back a long way
from their present status
in Congress.
So far as organization is
concerned, the Conserva-
Some important qualifi-
cations are in order before
such an apparently simple
solution is tried—a solu-
tion that is bound to fail.
The British Conservatives
adopted a great many wel-
fare activities well before
the Labor Party came to
power in 1945. In fact, La-
bor borrowed a great deal
from the Conservatives.
The Conservatives, after
the Lloyd George reforms
of nearly 50 years ago,
carried on much of the
Liberal Party program.
But there is a fundamental
difference in direction and
emphasis between Con-
servative and Labor wel-
farism. This was neatly
stated by Ian MacLeod,
the present Conservative
Minister of Labor, in a
television program in
Washington less than two
weeks ago.
In answer to a report-
er's question, he said that
Labor stood for "equality"
and the Conservatives for
"opportunity." This is
much more than a mere
semantic difference. It
tive Party has stressed
three principles above all.
First, there are competent
executives at the head of
the main party and in the
various constituencies.
These have been drawn to
a considerable extent from
businessmen willing to
work.
The head of the rebuild-
ing after 1945 was Lord
Woolton, who came into
national politics after a
long and successful career
in business.
Second, the rebuilt Con-
servative Party has em-
phasized the use of trained
professional political work-
ers at the local or constitu-
ency level.
Third, in seeking votes
they have labored assidu-
ously to get the voting
support of the great mid-
dle class, once the support
of the Liberal Party and
temporarily attached in
part to Labor.
