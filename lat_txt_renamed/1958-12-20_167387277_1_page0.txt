RAYMOND MOLEY:
Mrs. Roosevelt on
Democratic Nominee
It is not surprising, as
more and more possibili-
ties for the Presidential
nomination appear on the
Democratic scene, that
there is more and more
talk about getting out the
old model for another run
—Adlai Stevenson.
Eleanor Roosevelt,
whose voice is important
in Democratic ranks, has
had some things to say re-
cently. Commenting that
Stevenson is "the best we
could have," she added in
a television interview that
the practical politicians
who do the nominating
may be looking for a new-
er model, presumably with
higher fins and dual-head-
lights.
One such, whom she re-
gards as possessing a
"spark of greatness," is
Sen. Hubert Humphrey,
the latest of those who
have interviewed the or-
acle in the Kremlin. Mrs.
Roosevelt added that in
giving so much time to
Minnesota's fast-talking
solon Khrushchev recog-
nized him as "a potential
power." No doubt the
Senator has long been of
that mind himself.
*
The former First Lady
was harsh with the man
most frequently mentioned
as a contender, Sen. John
Kennedy. Mrs. Roosevelt's
remarks concerning Ken-
nedy reveal her chronic in-
ability to clothe her
thoughts with clear lan-
guage, but the basic opin-
ion she holds is very clear
indeed. She does not like
Sen. Kennedy and she does
not like his father, Joseph
Patrick Kennedy, onetime
American Ambassador to
the Court of St. James.
She said among other
things in referring to Sen.
Kennedy, no doubt having
in mind his best-selling
treatise, "Profiles in Cour-
age":
"I feel that I would
hesitate to place the diffi-
cult decisions that the next
President will have to
make with someone who
understands what courage
is and admires it, but has
not quite the independence
to have it."
When a man's independ-
ence is questioned, the
speaker has an obligation,
it would seem, to specify
who is holding the leash.
But Mrs. Roosevelt did not
mention the source of Ken-
nedy's limitations. Thus
she left some inferences
that are not quite fair.
Of Kennedy, the father,
she remarked that he had
been "spending oodles of
money all over the coun-
try in his son's behalf"
and that he "probably has
paid representatives in ev-
ery State by now." To
clarify this, she added that
it is perfectly legitimate
to have such paid work-
ers. In fact, when her hus-
band Franklin was seeking
the nomination in 1931
and 1932 he had the ad-
vantage of the Governor-
ship of New York to pro-
vide workers in the great
crusade without burdening
the family budget.
★
It might be added that
father Joseph Patrick
Kennedy's monetary con-
tribution to that cause in
those years was not a
source of Mrs. Roosevelt's
many cares then. Appar-
ently what was sauce for
Franklin—very gratefully
received—is not sauce for
son John Kennedy now.
This feeling of Mrs.
Roosevelt for the Ken-
nedys is no new matter,
however. In the first year
of the Roosevelt regime,
1933-1934, the late Louis
Howe, who for some rea-
son had a violent antip-
athy for father Kennedy,
labored to block any ap-
pointment for him which
any contributor—"before
Chicago," they called it—
might regard as the legiti-
mate reward for help in
time of need. Then as
always, Howe was Mrs.
Roosevelt's mentor, guide,
confidant, and source of al-
most supernatural wisdom.
Perhaps her memory, of
which there is published
evidence in her many
memoirs, carries back to
that feud. For while her
memoirs show distressing
errors of fact, her grudges
are always bright and well
polished, notably in her
opinions of Smith and Far-
ley.
While many may regard
Kennedy as too immature
for the tasks of the Presi-
dency, it is only fair that
this echo of "battles long
ago," when he was only
15 years old, should not be
held an obstacle to his am-
bitions now.
