RAYMOND MOLEY:
NEA and the Critics
of Federal School Aid
A good example of the
fact that many who are
prating about liberalism
and democracy are nei-
ther, in fact, liberal nor
democratic is the cam-
paign of the National
Education Association
against periodicals which
have been critical of cer-
tain legislative measures
favored by powerful pres-
sure groups. An important
statement concerning this
is in the January issue of
the Reader's Digest. This
magazine has built its
enormous circulation over
the years by printing ar-
ticles that come close to
the immediate personal
and civic affairs of Amer-
ica's great main street. It
has always had the cour-
age of the convictions of
its editors.
*
In the present instance,
the trouble started with
the publication of an ar-
ticle, more than a year
ago, advocating more econ-
omy of types of school
construction. Clearly, this
was to show that if School
Boards generally over the
country would spend what
they have in more econom-
ical construction, there
would be little or no jus-
tification for the clamor
for Federal aid.
The NEA thereupon
launched an attack upon
the Reader's Digest, im-
pugning the accuracy of
the article and, as the
Digest's editorial says,
"twisting the theme," mak-
ing "every effort to con-
fuse the issue with irrele-
vancies, distortions and
quibblings over questions
of fact." Thereupon the Di-
gest published two articles
in 1958 which revealed the
extravagances in school
construction and the de-
cline in quality in public
school instruction.
Then the attacks by the
NEA and allied pressure
groups—there are many of
these—became more and
more virulent.
*
Nobody can object to a
lively argument over as
important a public inter-
est as educational methods
and content and school
construction. A free ex-
pression of opinion can
result in a sharper sense
of responsibility on the
part of all school author-
ities. That is the way of
democracy. To tolerate it
is the essence of real lib-
eralism.
But another and vastly
more sinister drive, ac-
cording to the Reader's
Digest, has been under
way. Some educators have
threatened a boycott
against the use of the
magazine in the schools as
a teaching aid. This sort
of use of magazines has
been a practice in schools
a long time. It is an indis-
pensable means of supple-
menting the books which,
in the nature of things,
are not current and
abreast of immediate pub-
lic problems. This sort of
boycott, the Digest points
out, makes the students
and the teachers in the
schools the chief victims.
★
I would like to add that
in my role as a free and
independent journalist I
have been likewise criti-
cal of the claims of the
NEA, of its pressure for
Federal aid, and of the
quality of school construc-
tion and of much of pres-
ent-day teaching. Conse-
quently, a great many
letters have been ad-
dressed to the editors of
Newsweek, to which I
contribute a weekly ar-
ticle, not only denouncing
the authenticity of my
statements but making
personal attacks and can-
celing subscriptions.
At least one such letter
came, of all things, on the
letterhead of the NEA.
There have been many
editors and circulation
managers during the years
when I have published
1300 weekly articles, and
no one has yet edited one
or even suggested their
content. I am in a fortu-
nate position, as are New-
week and the Digest. We
can ignore boycotts and
threats. But this cannot
be true of many of those
upon whom their pressure
group attempts to enforce
conformity.
★
My reply to the NEA of-
ficially was that "I am
rather surprised that a re-
sponsible officer of a teach-
ers' organization, which of
all others should be dedi-
cated to free expression of
opinion and facts, should
favor utter conformity
with his ideas in every-
thing he reads." Much
stronger language was in
my mind when I wrote
that mild expression.
I can assure him and the
organization he represents
that the fight will go on
for sound teaching in
sensibly constructed build-
ings.
