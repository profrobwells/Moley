RAYMOND MOLEY:
New Encroachments
on Local Authority
Certain senators elected
in large industrial states
are, it is reported, plan-
ning to press legislation
making the bombing of
churches and schools a
federal offense, with en-
forcement by the FBI and
the federal courts.
Every decent American,
north and south, has been
horrified by the conduct of
certain creatures who
have committed these
crimes. The indignation
thus aroused is fully
shared by state and local
authorities in the places
where these atrocious acts
have been perpetrated.
However, if this propos-
al to relieve these state
and local authorities from
responsibility is the result
of the rush of Sen. Javits
and Sen.-elect Keating to
Atlanta since the election,
several second thoughts
are in order.
The political motives of
those senators to make
their well-publicized trip
are understandable. In
politics such a trip with
attendant publicity seems
to make any motive worth-
while.
The proposal to make
the bombing of churches
and schools a federal
crime may well be re-
garded as an omen of
things to come as federal
money and authority creep
over the nation. This is
an aspect of federal aid
which has been singularly
neglected.
If the federal govern-
ment is to build schools,
contribute to the payment
of teachers and provide
scholarships, what is to
prevent the federalizers
from insisting that federal
police protect these fed-
eral investments?
After federal money has
seeped into every cranny
of the states the urge for
regulation and protection
by federal police agencies
will come as a matter of
course. It is hardly too
much to say that this will
mean a police state in al-
most every sense of that
term.
When Franklin D.
Roosevelt was President
this writer was designat-
ed by him to make a study
of racketeering and kid-
naping and to see what
proper measures might be
taken to meet that sort of
criminal activity. Mr.
Roosevelt or Louis Howe
had already instructed the
attorney general to go
ahead with the preparation
of bills for enactment by
Congress.
Fortunately, before I
made a report, I went to
see the chairman of the
House Judiciary Commit-
tee, Hatton Sumners of
Texas. I found that fine
constitutionalist and law-
yer in a towering rage.
He pointed to a pile of bills
on his desk which had
been sent over by the at-
torney general.
On examination, the bills
were found to be an aggre-
gation of the worst-consid-
ered-and-drawn documents
which we had ever seen
proposed by a responsi-
ble government depart-
ment. Some, designed to
make racketeering a fed-
eral crime, would have
prohibited the existence of
a labor union at all. They
would have been an illegal
conspiracy. The net of the
bills would have gripped
the states and local gov-
ernments in a federal octo-
pus.
Needless to say, Sum-
ners consigned most of
those bills to the waste-
basket and then devised
the kidnaping and racket-
eering measures which are
now the law.
Sumners pointed out
that not only would hys-
terical dumping of new
duties on the FBI utterly
destroy the unique charac-
ter of that agency but
would cause local authori-
ties to throw up their
hands and let the Federal
government take over.
In addition, there was in
his argument the over-
whelming consideration
that since law enforce-
ment should be kept close
to the people the denial to
them of their constitution-
al responsibility and au-
thority would also deny
them essential liberties.
This is a peril which is
created by every new fed-
eral activity. It is appar-
ently unnoted by those
who propose hysterical
measures to turn every-
thing over to Uncle Sam.
