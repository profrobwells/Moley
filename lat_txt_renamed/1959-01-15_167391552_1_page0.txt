A CALL FOR
PROPHETS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The latest recruit to
what eggheads call "goal-
ism" is President Eisen-
hower. A sizable part of
his message is devoted to
the suggestion that there
be appointed, perhaps by
the President, a group of
"educators and represent-
atives of labor, manage-
ment, finance, the profes-
sions, agriculture and
every other kind of useful
activity."
This collection of what
he calls "selfless" individ-
uals would survey us and
plan what we should all
do to attain certain
"goals" in five or perhaps
10 years.
He mentions that there
was that sort of body in
1931, which submitted
what was called "Social
Trends" in two fat vol-
umes. I remember that
document well. Someone
gave me a copy when the
plans of Gov. Roosevelt
were being made. It con-
sisted of hundreds of
pages of exceedingly dull
prose, graphs, and tables.
So far as I know, it had
no influence and dropped
into the dusty obscurity
of library shelves. For all
that it said was more at-
tractively presented in
hundreds of other places.

Someone seems to have
recently called it to the
attention of the President
—perhaps somebody who
would like to have employ-
ment in a similar scholar-
ly reproduction of what
is generally known.
Goalism is a very popu-
lar pastime these days.
Nelson Rockefeller, with
the itch to get into poli-
tics, had his Brothers
Fund spend a large chunk
of family money on a lot
of reports which, embla-
zoned in the press, helped
set the stage for his politi-
cal coming-out party.
These reports are now
worth about the same per
hundredweight as aban-
doned campaign literature
or old newspapers.
But don't we have plen-
ty of government prophecy
departments already scan-
ning things and getting
their gist, over to the gov-
ernment printing office?
To list a few, we have the
President's own Council of
Economic Advisers and
the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, the Department of
Agriculture has a big
prophecy bureau whose
interest goes all over the
national map, and there is
the same sort of thing in
the Commerce Depart-
ment. Then there is the
Federal Reserve Board
a-planning and a-plotting
and a-goaling. The federal
government has many oth-
er agencies doing it, such
as the Census Bureau.
Outside the government
plenty of "selfless" people
are issuing things along
that line. There is the Na-
tional Bureau of Economic
Research, the Conference
Board, the AFL-CIO eco-
nomic seers and many
trade associations such as
the NAM and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

There were also the two
Hoover Commissions with
reports. These were well
worth while so far as
pointing out what the fed-
eral government ought to
do about planning itself.
But only the more innocu-
ous recommendations have
been seriously considered
and adopted by the Presi-
dent and Congress.
It would seem to me that
before the federal govern-
ment sets out to plan what
175 million people should
do in the next five or 10
years, it might plan a little
about its own messy,
shapeless, and grossly ex-
pensive self. Just the other
day the comptroller gener-
al of the United States is-
sued a report calling the
attention of Congress to an
agency that has done noth-
ing since 1957 and recom-
mending that it be liqui-
dated.
I haven't checked re-
cently, but I believe that
there are government
agencies — useless and
pointless—that originated
in the days of the Civil
War. Even when an agen-
cy's power has been elim-
inated by Congress, there
is a skeleton organization
left to liquidate it. It is
wonderful how long some
bureaucrats can keep up
the job of liquidation.
These skeleton bureaus are
in the government's closet.
Something might be done
with them now that econ-
omy is the order of the
day.
