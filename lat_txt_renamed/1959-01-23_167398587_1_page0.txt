President Eisenhower
has shown a soldier's cour-
age as well as long-sighted
economic statesmanship in
selecting a balanced budg-
et and inflation as his
fighting issue with the new
Congress.

The odds are fearfully
against him. And he labors
under a political handicap
which he will find de-
pletes his energies as
much as the physical bur-
dens he has suffered
through his heart attack,
his ileitis and his slight
stroke. This is his position
as a President in his last
two years of office.

The enemy which he
faces is inflation. The
shrinking of the dollar by
that name is publicly op-
posed by everybody, but
also the essence of it is fa-
vored by innumerable
somebodies.

Inflation, everyone
agrees, is a malignant nar-
cotic. But like many other
dangerous drugs, it can be
sold under other, perfectly
innocent and attractive
names.

There is, for example,
"expanded human welfare
benefits," the main politi-
cal promise in the cam-
paigns of many a member
of this Congress. They fa-
vor, as Sen. Johnson's
sophistry puts it, a bal-
anced budget, but also a
balanced status of human
welfare.

There are those Cham-
bers of Commerce that
decry an unsound fiscal
system, but believe that
their particular handouts
for their special bailiwicks
are possible within the
limits of a balanced
budget.

There are the economic
sophists who confidently
say that if the federal gov-
ernment spends a lot,
there will be a lot of new
revenue coming in from
rising production.

There are the union
leaders, who claim that
higher wages and more
benefits can be extracted
from the profits accruing
from more production.

Finally, and most im-
portant of all, there are
the debtors-vastly more
numerous than those who
suffer under the limits of
fixed incomes-who wel-
come the prospect of pay-
ing back in dollars less
valuable than the dollars
they borrowed.

But against these inter-
ests and sophistries there
is the undeniable peril of
inflation per se. The real
danger of an increasing in-
flation is that it is fed
mostly by psychological
factors.

It comes in three phases.
First, there is the stage in
which the supply of mon-
ey is increasing and pass-
ing from hand to hand at a
faster rate than the sup-
ply of goods available for
purchase.

Second, there is the
phase in which there is
fear of scarcity of goods,
which induces a scramble
for goods and services
with offers constantly ris-
ing.

Third, there is the phase
in which a real fear con-
cerning the value of mon-
ey is realized. This has
been characterized in
many countries in many
eras of history as a flight
from the franc or pound or
mark, or any other unit of
value.

This is one of the most
deadly of all economic per-
ils, because if it happens,
there will be a flight from
the securities of the gov-
ernment. And when that
happens, the foundation of
all security is shaken -
the credit of the govern-
ment itself.

If that phase is reached,
a spendthrift Congress will
have trouble in financing
its own deficit spending.
For when people will not
buy the bonds and supply
the money for all the
"good" services that buy
votes, all security is
shaken - personal, finan-
cial, and industrial.

The perils of that third
phase are something that
the President clearly can-
not use as a means of sum-
moning public support.
For to dwell upon it would
produce the very fear that
might loose the flood of
hysteria. But it is some-
thing that reasonable peo-
ple should realize without
being told.

Where we are at this
moment in this cycle is
anyone's guess. But its in-
exorable course is as cer-
tain as decay, death, and
dissolution.

The President must in-
duce caution without excit-
ing fear. That is a formida-
ble task. But it is one in
which he deserves the sup-
port of all men who can
reason and who love their
country.
