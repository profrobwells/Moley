Edward R. Murrow's
radio presentation of com-
mercialized vice in the
world of business has very
considerably stirred the
officials in New York City
who are responsible for
law enforcement. I am
not concerned in this
piece with the validity of
the questions which are
raised about whether the
conditions revealed actu-
ally exist, or with the mo-
tives of the people who
put the show together, or
with the matter of taste
involved.
But it seems to me that
there is in this sensation-
al incident a basic prob-
lem which should pro-
foundly concern the peo-
ple who are running the
broadcasting business. As
I see it, these networks
are trustees of a part of
the public domain under
the laws and regulations
of government.
In providing entertain-
ment as well as news and
nalism, has a long and dis-
tinguished past.
Both have recognized
that they must provide
not only entertainment
but leadership in public
opinion, leadership ex-
pressed sometimes in re-
vealing the ills with
which society is afflicted,
along with the worthy ob-
jective of making society
and people better.
The Murrow perform-
ance was a confusion of
the two functions. If the
same sort of expose had
been done under the tra-
ditions of newspapers, the
characters in it would
have been named or at
least made sufficiently
known so that they might
provide a means by which
the machinery of law en-
forcement might get at
the evil and do something
about it.
The characteristic pat-
tern of a newspaper cru-
sade is, first, to expose a
situation of this sort.
delinquents, act out the
situation. That was true
in such plays as "Dam-
aged Goods" or "Mrs.
Warren's Profession."
They were shows, and
they had lessons to teach.
A sensational example
of confusion occurred
when Orson Welles staged
an invasion from Mars.
Panic gripped New Jer-
sey and New York be-
cause people didn't know
whether they were listen-
ing to news or fiction.
In the Murrow case,
nothing has been provid-
ed to help law enforce-
ment, although the char-
acters are presumably
real. When there was
pressure for identification,
the sanctuary of journal-
ism was sought. But was
it wholly journalism and
thus entitled to the im-
munities and privileges of
journalism?
Here was confusion
more confounded by the
hour. Mr. Murrow is gen-
information concerning
public affairs, they play
two roles. They are defi-
nitely in show business.
They are also in a sort
of journalism.
Each of these activities
has its rules, regulations,
and traditions. Both lines
of activity, show business
and journalism, have de-
veloped their methods
and principles over a long
period. For while radio
and television are rela-
tively new, the drama is
very old indeed. And jour-
Then the newspaper ex-
pects the officials of law
enforcement, to get into
the act. Then the news-
paper publishes what is
being done by the law en-
forcement people. Most
crusades are designed to
lead to government action.
In drama with social
significance the lesson is
real and the situation is
supposed to be typical.
But the characters and
the exact plot are fiction-
al and are known to be
such. Actors, not actual
erally billed as a news-
man, but is he also in
show business? Was he
Shaw or was he Hearst?
The whole situation re-
veals a confusion in this
new industry of broadcast-
ing. No one questions
their service in providing
both entertainment and
information. But they
must be sure that they
don't change hats in the
middle of the perform-
ance.
