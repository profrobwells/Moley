RAYMOND MOLEY:
Proposal Jeopardizes
Independence of FRB
Despite the limitations
put upon what was called
the "fool" employment bill
in 1946 by Sen. Taft and
others, the measure still
presents opportunities for
liberal moves toward an
economic dictatorship. In
the present session of Congress, Sen: Clark of Pennsylvania and Rep. Reuss of
Wisconsin have introduced twin bills which
provide two drastic
changes in the operations
under the act.
*
Section 1 of these bills
would require the President to make recommendations in his annual economic report regarding
monetary and credit policies which now rest exclusively with the Federal
Reserve Board. Then, if
the board disagreed with
the President, the latter
would be required to report the disagreement,
with reasons, to Congress.
Sen. Clark argues that
this section would merely
require the President to
take into consideration the
whole economic front, including credit and monetary policies, policies now vested in the Federal Reserve System. He claims
that this "would not impair the status of the Federal Reserve Board as an
independent agency."
No, it would simply
compel the President to
throw the great power of
his office into disagreement with the board. In
that case Sen. Clark and
others of his point of view
would call for "unified"
policy and force the board
into the complete control
of the President and the
Secretary of the Treasury.
*
I wish that the late Sen.
Carter Glass might be in
the Senate and witness
this attack upon the system of which he was a
major architect. He would
point out that the far-sighted purpose of the
wise people who created
the Federal Reserve Board
was to put on guard over
credit and monetary policy a sort of supreme court,
safely removed from the
political expediencies and
schemes of a politically
minded, elective President. This point has been
argued again and again in
the 45 years' life of the
board and has always ended with the board remaining independent. It has
stood firm even against
the efforts of strong Presidents to influence its policies. The present chairman of the board, William.
McC. Martin, has vigorously opposed the Clark-
Reuss proposal.
The former chairman of
the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, Edwin G. Nourse, makes a
telling point against the
Clark-Reuss idea. He says
that while the President's
economic report comes out
only once a year, the regulation of credit and monetary policy is a week-to-week matter. Also, the
Federal Reserve Board is
equipped with machinery
to appraise the economic
weather through the far-flung Federal Reserve System, and it is vastly more
competent to use the necessary judgment in this
field.
*
Section 2 of the Clark-
Reuss bills would require
the Council of Economic
Advisers to request management and labor to justify at public hearings any
contemplated price and
wage increases which the
council or the President
think would threaten dollar stability. Then, if the
council considered it wise,
it might issue advisory
statements.
Here again Nourse
makes a telling point. He
asks: "When, and how, are
you going to find out that
price or wage increases
are pending?"
Overshadowing the
practical objections to the
Clark-Reuss plan is its underlying purpose to create
in the federal government
the means for an economic
planning dictatorship.
Necessarily this would be
political, since the President is a political officer.
*
One of the basic
thoughts in the minds of
most of the economic
statesmen who created the
Federal Reserve System
was measurably to decentralize the control of credit
and take this vital function away from powerful
banking interests on Wall
Street. It would indeed be
ironical if this means to
break a private monopoly
should be the instrument
for the creation of a social-
istic government monopoly.
