RAYMOND MOLEY:
New Governors Must
Face Up to Promises
Political Micawbers who
buy votes by unscrupu-
lous, irresponsible appeals
to public hankering for
something for nothing
sometimes find that suc-
cess is very costly. The
heads of some of the can-
didates who wallowed in
publicity after their glo-
rious victories in Novem-
ber now rumple the pil-
lows in the governor's
mansions in long sleepless
nights.
For unlike the happy
Senators and Congress-
men, whose equally un-
scrupulous promises can
be redeemed by whirring
printing presses, gover-
nors must measurably pay
as they go.
The agonies of three of
these promising princes
we are able to witness
with a grim satisfaction,
tempered only by the real-
ization that our money,
not theirs, is involved in
the painful operations that
lie ahead.
Nelson Rockefeller is
finding that it is one thing
to sponsor, with inherited
tax-exempt money, the
reports of the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund envision-
ing a happy citizenry of
moochers on government
bounty, and another mat-
ter entirely to face these
people as lacerated tax-
payers.
I have in these chron-
icles as far ago as last au-
tumn described some of
his promises, including a
pledge to our Puerto Rican
brethren that they should
have relief money without
any resident requirement
and live without honest
toil in government hous-
ing.
One of his troubles is
that he succeeded as gov-
ernor an equally lavish
exponent of the welfare
state, Averell Harriman,
who made merry with the
nest eggs left by a more
prudent Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey.
*
It isn't a matter of par-
ty, because whenever a
Connecticut resident meets
a New Yorker these days
he makes merry about his
Gov. Ribicoff, a Democrat,
who started his second
term with a wholesale
slaughter of bureaus and
tax-eaters in the govern-
ment.
In Michigan the inexor-
able, soulless balance sheet
has finally got Mennen
Williams in a corner where
neither his personal charm
nor Walter Reuther can-
help. While Rockefeller
needs, he says, $277 mil-
lion in new revenues, Wil-
liams needs $140 million.
He says that the state's
tax structure is "confused,
complex, inadequate and
inequitable." But he has
been governor quite a
while and apparently
failed to make the neces-
sary reforms.
The real fact is that not
only is the state's tax
structure "confused, in-
adequate and inequitable,"
but so is the governor. He
is not, however, "complex."
*
In California Gov. Ed-
mund G. Brown is pad-
dling among the same fis-
cal waves as Rockefeller
and Williams. For he has
a hungry Legislature on
his hands, together with
the stark cash-on-demand
Democratic platform on
which he ran staring him
in the face. That platform
consisted of a most fantas-
tic program for collectiv-
ism.
The only hope for Cali-
fornia taxpayers is that
Brown will be faithless
enough to abandon it, now,
that he no longer needs it,
and try to prevent a rush
of business from the state.
He says he needs almost
as much as Rockefeller—
$256 million. Some of his
Democratic colleagues in
the Legislature are consid-
ering a raid on certain
state trust funds to ease
the peril of higher taxes.
All these governors prob-
ably will be "favorite sons"
in the 1960 conventions.
They coldly calculate that
by that time people will
forget their tax hurts and
be prey for more abundant
promises.

It would seem to me
that the Hon. Richard M.
Nixon is too intelligent a
politician, as well as too
honest a man, to overlook
this situation of his rivals
in his researches as head
of the President's Com-
mittee on Inflation. For
one of the reasons ad-
vanced for more inflation-
ary spending by the feder-
al government is that the
states are unable financi-
ally to do things for them-
selves.
The wanton promises
and succeeding extrava-
gant spending in the states
are a major reason for the
"need" for federal aid—if
it be need. And so let there
be light, not only on fed-
eral waste, but state and
local waste as well.
