False Economy Can
Threaten Security
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

While other senators are
carrying on day after day
about our defense defi-
ciencies. Sen. Kefauver is
arguing for a proposition
which is much more dan-
gerous to our internal
safety than many of the
items they are talking
about.
It seems that the Ten-
nessee Valley Authority
has needed a new 500,000
kilowatt turbogenerator, a
very large one, said to be
the largest ordered instal-
lation of the kind in the
United States. Bids were
received from three firms
--Westinghouse, General
Electric, and C. A. Par-
sons and Co. of England.
The two American firms
asked something more
than $19 million; the Eng-
lish bidder, something
more than $13 million. The
saving would thus be $6
million. The reasons given
by the TVA for favoring
the English firm were
mainly on the basis of
economy. Sen. Kefauver
defends the TVA with his
usual charges about mo-
nopoly and unnecessarily
high prices.

The argument about the
difference in costs is an-
swered by a group of
American companies in-
cluding, besides the two
mentioned above, six other
manufacturers.
They point out that la-
bor costs account for the
difference. The average
hourly earnings in Ameri-
can companies are two and
a half times those in Eng-
land. And half the cost of
American products of this
kind represents the cost of
labor. The unions in-
volved are supporting the
protest of the American
companies.
Sen. Kefauver seems to
think that these mammoth
machines are mass produc-
tion affairs, like refrigera-
tors or stoves. They cer-
tainly are not. Each gen-
erator of that kind is a
special problem needing
individual plans, tools and
workmanship. Construc-
tion is a long job. The
parts are not interchange-
able. The installation made
by ene company cannot be
repaired or parts replaced
by another company.

Hence, if anything goes
wrong with the Parsons
generator, Parsons must
provide the parts and re-
pairs. In an emergency,
such as war, if American
companies should have to
undertake to repair the
Parsons installation
months and years would be
required to tool up and
manufacture the parts.

Moreover, with the con-
tinuing awarding of such
equipment contracts to
European concerns, our
companies would in large
part have to discontinue
such manufacturing. For
60% of their business has
been with the government.
That makes this sort of
manufacturing available to
the general market at a
reasonable cost.
The trend by agencies
created and supported by
the federal government to
buy abroad has been going
on progressively for a
long time. Of the total or-
ders of heavy power trans-
formers since 1952, the pro-
portion that has gone
abroad has gone up from
27% to 80%. In 1956, the
Army Corps of Engineers
bought 26% of its power
equipment from abroad;
the Bonneville Power Ad-
ministration, 39%, and the
Bureau of Reclamation,
47%.
This trend is bad for
American labor standards;
for the stockholders in the
companies, who number in
the millions; for American
customers, and, most im-
portant, for the security of
the nation.

The petition of the
American companies is be-
fore the Office of Civil and
Defense Mobilization. If
this body, which is
charged with the protec-
tion of national security,
decides that this is a
threat it will so report to
the President, who is re-
quired by law to adjust
such imports. The issue
will probably come to a
head in a few weeks.
The British, incidental-
ly, do not buy heavy elec-
tric power equipment from
foreign sources.
