Subsidized Housing
Raid on Taxpayers-
Three proposals for a
variety of kinds of hous-
ing at federal expense are
before Congress.
The administration's
bill compared with the
others is modest, although
it fails to come to grips
with the essential vices in
this sort of spending. Since
it Has no chance in this
Congress, we may forget it
and turn to the ones which
are almost certain to be
enacted in a somewhat
compromised form.
*
The Sparkman bill was
passed by the Senate Feb.
5. While it is an irresponsi-
ble raid on the taxpayers
of the country, it is some-
what scaled down from the
measure pressed by Sen.
Clark of Pennsylvania.
The Sparkman bill
would provide $2.1 billion
for "urban renewal,"
which means, in plain Eng-
lish, tearing down some
sections of cities and build-
ing large apartment build-
ings for people in low and
medium income groups.
The money would be spent
over a period of six years.
There would be $300
million in loans for college
housing; loans to colleges
for classrooms and educa-
tional facilities amounting
to $125 million; $150 mil-
lion for veterans' housing
loans, and $10 billion in
FHA insurance authority.
The bill now passed by
the House Committee on
Banking and Currency is
somewhat different in de-
tails but also commits the
treasury for about the
same $10 billion for FHA
mortgages.

In order to illustrate the
vice in these measures, it
will suffice to call attention
to the comments made by
the minority report of the
House committee. For the
measure would commit
taxpayers far into the next
generation for an inde-
terminate and doubtful
need.
The trick in both bills is
to have them seem to place
very little or no addition
to the amount of spending
in the fiscal year begin-
ning next July 1. This is an
insincere and pious ges-
ture toward balancing the
next budget. The bills
would result in increased
spending for 45 years in
the future. The total bill in
the House committee vas-
sion would be $5.8 billion.
Let us look at this com-
mitment in the light of
what federal housing aid
was intended to do when
it originated back in the
1930s. The depression had
left a big deficit in housing.
It was said by someone
then that new construction
hardly made up for the
houses burned down each
year.
It was recognized that
the building of houses with
the large amount of pri-
vate money then in sav-
ings of various kinds
would help pick up heavy,
capital goods industry,
which was in a state of de-
pression even after 1933.
The justification for grants,
loans and the guarantee of
mortgages by the federal
government was that they
would help turn the flow of
private money in insurance
companies and the like
into needed building.
*
But it was recognized
that the emergency would
pass as soon as a few
years' building was com-
pleted. In short, it was re-
garded as an emergency af-
fair.
Now, as the decades
pass, we realize that we
are committed to an en-
tirely different proposi-
tion. This is to subsidize
the rent of a large part of
the population, not just the
low-income people but with
every passing year people
with higher and higher in-
comes.
Some of the early pub-
lic housing projects are
already obsolete, ill-kept,
broken-down slums. Un-
der the present philoso-
phy of something for ev-
erybody, meanwhile, peo-
ple are flocking into the
cities in search of better
employment and claiming
the right to subsidized
housing. Into New York
City alone flow hundreds
of thousands of Puerto
Ricans.
*
We have established an
entirely new class with a
claimed right to this help.
What was once an emer-
gency is a policy. What
was once a lift for the
needy is a right for many
who are not needy at all.
And note that the
House bill would give, not
loan, $5.2 billion of this
obligated money.
