'Liberal' Frustration
and the Housing Bill
A $6.1 billion omnibus
housing bill is now held
more or less securely in
the Rules Committee of
the House of Representa-
tives. Liberals will scream
about this frustration, and
the first real test of their
capacity to override the
committee will soon come.
The objections of the
conservatives who have
checked this measure are
numerous and important.
For its great size would
greatly unbalance the
budget and fan the blaze
of inflation; its provisions
would permit direct bor-
rowing from the Treasury
and thus the bypassing of
the appropriations commit-
tees of both houses; it
would, through contract
authorizations, commit fu-
ture Congresses to proj-
ects which might not be
needed or wanted.
*
It would also enlarge
and continue the devious
practice of providing tax
exemption for vast
amount of bonds and thus
provide a convenient
means by which rich indi-
viduals and corporations
would avoid taxes; under-
mine local responsibility
for urban renewal; project
for nearly half a century
into the future subsidized
housing for progressively
higher income people; and,
what is most serious,
make an ever-increasing
proportion of the Ameri-
can people dependent
upon the federal govern-
ment for the roofs over
their heads.
While not directly relat-
ed to this bill, but bearing
on the general administra-
tion of existing housing
programs, several studies
were made by Comptroller
Gen. Campbell. His criti-
cisms were directed to
military housing. This re-
vealed a lack of emphasis
on economy, the failure of
the FHA to adjust the bid
prices to comply with the
terms of bids, the exces-
sive costs in title search
and insurance, and inade-
quate criteria for the size
of housing units.
*
The fate of the bill may
well be determined by the
two-thirds liberal member-
ship of the house, lashed
on by innumerable lob-
bies, uplift organizations,
and other special interests.
Most serious in this pro-
gressive growth of public
housing is the extent to
which it permits bureau-
cratic snooping into the
private affairs of benefi-
ciaries. It will illustrate
the logic through which
the welfare state levies
great charges against per-
sonal liberty.
The question of racial
integration in public hous-
ing is already settled in
previous congressional en-
actments. But one impor-
tant matter for those who
are the beneficiaries of
these anti-segregation
measures is whether what
they gain in the legal
right to live near and
among people of the oth-
er race is worth what
they lose in other sorts of
rights.
*
A personal reference
may illustrate this point.
We have a fine, faithful,
competent, proud Ameri-
can citizen who for com-
pensation assists with the
maintenance of our house-
hold. She maintains a per-
sonal residence in a pri-
vately owned apartment
house. This is subject to
the rent control law of
New York.
Yesterday she brought
me a bureaucratic form
embodying a demand by
the landlord for an in-
crease of her rent. Amid
all of the printed falde-
ral appears the typed-in
name of a young woman
whom she has taken in to
live with her.
She would prefer to live
alone, but since she must
help to provide the eve-
ning meal which is essen-
tial for the maintenance of
the life of this writer and
his family, she is absent
from her home until 9
p.m. On two occasions be-
fore she took in the com-
panion, her apartment was
burglarized and valuable
property was stolen.
Hence, the presence of
her companion is essential
to the protection of her
premises.
*
The point of the demand
for more rent is apparent-
ly the presence of this
companion.
What I wanted to write,
in helping her to answer,
was that it is none of the
bureaucrat's infernal busi-
ness why a guest should
be occupying a room in an
apartment, the rent of
which had been fixed in
line with a fair degree of
maintenance and conven-
ience. But such an answer
from her would have been
a reason for haling her be-
fore the bureaucrat - for
explanation.
This incident deals with
rent control, not public
housing. But it suffices to
show the way of bureauc-
racy with the liberty of
an American.
