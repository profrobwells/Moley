Harassed congressmen
and senators must be ut-
terly distracted in trying
to discover what they are
asked to vote upon. Cer-
tainly the innocent by-
stander, the taxpayer who
must pay the bills, is com-
pletely in the dark.
And this writer, whose
business is to follow and
comment upon current
legislation, has, until re-
cently, been greatly con-
fused about the distinc-
tions, if any, among three
costly schemes before Con-
gress.
These are urban renew-
al, area redevelopment and
communities facilities. At
first, glance they all mean
the same thing. All would
pour billions of federal
money into cities. All have
to do with building and all
are the assumption of re-
sponsibilities by the feder-
al government of activities
which used to be financed
and promoted by local gov-
ernments and local private
corporations and individu-
als.
Together, they would
impose federal plan-
ning involving the whole
economy. And this as-
sumption of a local func-
tion is eagerly sought by
mayors and local private
promoters.
Let us see just what
they are:
Urban renewal has been
going on for 10 years. It
has a bureaucracy of its
own, the Urban Renewal
Administration, which is
a division of the Federal
Housing and Home Fi-
nance Agency. It lends
money to local authorities
for city planning and
makes grants for federally
approved slum clearance,
including collateral mat-
ters such as the construc-
tion of streets, water serv-
ice and sewerage.
The federal government
pays two-thirds of the
cost, and the local authori-
ty one-third of the net
cost. Since these grandi-
ose projects involve mov-
ing people from their ex-
isting places of residence
or business, Uncle Sam
must find and pay for re-
location.
The tremendous omni-
bus housing bill which al-
ready has passed the Sen-
ate would provide for ur-
ban renewal $2.1 billion
over six years for federal
capital grants. The House
committee would provide
$1.5 billion over three
years, while the President
has asked for $1.5 billion
over a longer period, with
provision for gradually
getting the federal govern-
ment out of the business.
This bill may be stopped
in the House, as it was
last year. And if passed,
it might be vetoed by the
President. But whatever
happens, the senators who
voted for it have paid the
first installment on their
promises to the voters who
elected them.
The Community Facili-
ties Administration might,
if it were justified at all,
seem to fall within the
same area as urban re-
newal. But it has its own
bureaucracy, a division of
the Federal Housing Agen-
cy. It advances money
to small communities for
public works. The present
bill would expand and ex-
tend the operations of this
giving and loaning agen-
cy by a billion dollars.
The area redevelopment
bill which has passed
the Senate is a pet of Sen.
Paul Douglas. It would set
up another bureaucracy
called the Area Redevel-
opment Administration.
This would designate
places for "redevelop-
ment" in both industrial
and rural areas, more
plants and businesses, set
up all sorts of public fa-
cilities, and provide for vo-
cational training (another
educational agency). This
would cost around $300
million.
Since all three of these
projects, if justified at all,
could be done under one
bill and one administra-
tion, the sponsorship
shows how much mere
semantics is involved in
legislation. All have their
sponsors, which spreads
the credit for handouts,
and since each has its
own setup of bureaucrats,
much new work is pro-
vided for ever-increasing
bureaucracy.
All involve large spend-
ing now, and once bureaus
are set up and precedent
established, they would go
on for an indefinite time,
with ever-increasing
grants. Also, all would
weaken the capacity of lo-
cal governments and pri-
vate investors to do the
job themselves.
