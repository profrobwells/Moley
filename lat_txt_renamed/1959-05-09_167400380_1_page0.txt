The Absurd Reality
of Deficit Spending
Since every succeeding
election brings to Congress
new refugees from aca-
demic life fully equipped
with the jargon and
theory of what is being
taught there, it is neces-
sary to meet these theore-
ticians on their own
grounds.
The prevailing economic
philosophy of the liberals
in Congress, as manifested
in the many spending bills
now pending, clashes
sharply with the de-
termination of President
Eisenhower to fight infla-
tionary spending with
every weapon, including
the veto:
*
In this the President is
advised and briefed by
certain members of the ad-
ministration such as Secre-
taries Anderson, Benson
and Strauss.
The anointed prophet of
the liberal point of view is
the late John Maynard
Keynes, perhaps the most
influential economist of
this generation. He pro-
vided the rationalization
of heavy deficit spending.
And the main precept
which he left was the so-
called "multiplier theory."
I offer here the defini-
tion which Keynes pro-
vided in his major work,
"General Theory of Em-
ployment, Interest and
Money":
"In given circumstances
a definite ratio, to be
called the multiplier, can
be established between in-
come and investment and,
subject to certain simplifi-
cations, between the total
employment and the em-
ployment directly em-
ployed on investment."
*
Without getting into the
vast paraphernalia of
technical jargon and for-
mulas with which this is
established in the Keynes
book, I shall try to reduce
it to terms applicable to
the purposes and rational-
izations of the liberals.
Keynes, in advising
President Roosevelt in the
early 1930s, applied this
theory to the depressed
conditions in the Ameri-
can economy, then charac-
terized by a lack of invest-
ment and widespread un-
employment. He advised
that government spend
large sums of money, even
borrowed money.
Then this theory, as
stated in his book, held
that a dollar spent by gov-
ernment on public works,
even unnecessary and un-
productive works, would
yield 10 times the employ-
ment throughout the
economy which was used
directly on the govern-
ment project involved.
In a magnificent book,
just published (D. Van
Nostrand Co.), "The Roots
of Capitalism," by John
Chamberlain, this is re-
duced to its absurd reality:
"Money spent by gov-
ernment to put men to
work . . . would turn up
partly as consumption and
partly as savings . . . the
new consumption money
would go round and round
in the economy, 'leaking' a
little into savings with
each turn of the spending
cycle.
"Big fleas have little fleas,
"Upon their backs to bite
'em.
"And little fleas have less-
er fleas,
"And so ad infinitum.
*
"Only in the Keynes
version, the fleas are de-
clining increments of con-
sumption as the govern-
ment money injections
pass from hand to hand,
growing smaller all the
time as 'savings'—the
extinction of debt, the pay-
ment of insurance premi-
ums, etc.—tend, at least
momentarily, to sterilize
some of the purchasing
power."
The liberal spenders in
Congress, in following this
Keynesian mythology, con-
veniently ignore many ob-
jections, two of which are
these: The idea didn't
work in the 1930s. Unem-
ployment failed to improve
until the war, despite con-
tinuous deficit spending.
And the proposal of cur-
rent liberals to unbalance
the budget by around $10
billion could not greatly
affect employment. It took
a war, with spending of
$100 billion to $200 bil-
lion, to extinguish unem-
ployment of 9 million.
It also ignores the fact
that heavy taxes and in-
flation will kill vastly more
private venture capital
than anything the govern-
ment can spend.
The liberals also ignore
the Keynes provision that
when prosperity returns to
an economy, as it has right
now, the spending should
be cut off. But Keynes ig-
nored the basic principle
of American politics—that
spending gets votes, and
when once it is adopted
Congress will never put
the theory in reverse.
