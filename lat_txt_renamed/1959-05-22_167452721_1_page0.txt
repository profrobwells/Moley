Omnibus Housing Bill Provides
a Bonanza for Special Interests
Speaker Sam Rayburn
has redeemed his promise
to the House "liberals" by
bringing the omnibus
housing bill out of the
Rules Committee and onto
the floor where it was
passed yesterday.
Only a few organiza-
tions, such as the Nation-
al Association of Real Es-
tate Boards struggled
against the tide.
There is something for
so many special interests
that the "standby" queue
is miles long.
*
Included in the omni-
bus bill is something for
rich people seeking tax
exemption through the
billions in bonds which
will be issued, land spec-
ulators seeking windfalls
from the purchase and re-
sale of property, urban
planners who will get em-
ployment from the federal
grants for "urban plan-
ning" (there is even some-
thing for the training of
planners), people interest-
ed in "mortgage assist-
ance," "elderly persons"
seeking cheap housing,
colleges wanting new
buildings, veterans, farm-
ers seeking new houses,
hospitals, and many oth-
ers.
I have already com-
mented upon two features
of the housing operation
now in practice — the
windfall to the rich who
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
buy tax-exempt housing
bonds, and the windfall to
the people who buy back
at a bargain price the land
condemned and acquired
by the government.
An additional word
about those bonds. The
House bill would bring
the total amount of such
bonds to $14.4 billion.
Unlike the bonds of the
federal government, they
are tax exempt. The gov-
ernment must pay 4% or
more for the money to re-
deem these, which bear
3% interest. Thus, there
would be an increasing
burden of federal debt,
while those able to pay
taxes are enjoying exemp-
tion. The people who must
pay for an $80-billion gov-
ernment must pick up the
tab.
*
There is space here to
consider only one addi-
tional feature of the bill,
perhaps the most serious
of all. The concept of pub-
lic, subsidized housing
originated in the desire to
help really needy people
living in miserable places
to get a decent roof over
their heads. Hence, in ear-
lier laws there was some
semblance of an income
test and limit for those
permitted to have space.
This has been gradually
eased.
But this bill would
leave the matter wide
open. It would open pub-
lic, subsidized housing for
an indeterminate number
of higher-income families.
The bill would permit oc-
cupancy by all families
without a ratio between
the gross family income
(not just the income of
the head of the family but
of all earning members)
and the rent charged. The
public housing commis-
sioner has said that even
under the formula inter-
preting "lowest - income
group" (in the present
federal law), the family
income can go as high as
$9,800 a year.
★
An interesting angle of
this was pointed out in
the Boston Herald last
month concerning state-
aided housing projects in
that city. Members of the
police and fire depart-
ments have recently been
granted a very substantial
raise in pay. But the Bos-
ton Housing Authority
then sought to raise the
income ceilings of the
state-aided housing proj-
ects so that the 353 po-
licemen's and firemen's
families would not be dis-
turbed.
No one objects to a
good rate of pay for these
essential public services.
If a raise is needed and
deserved and possible,
they should get it in pay.
But the policy of provid-
ing housing as a fringe
benefit is in line neither
with their own dignity nor
public policy. For services
should be compensated for
with pay which can then
be spent in a free market.
