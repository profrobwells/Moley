Opposition to Strauss Is Based
on Motives Unworthy of Senators
A necessarily brief serv-
ice as secretary of com-
merce would neither add
to nor detract from Lewis
Strauss' reputation as a
public servant and private
citizen. His status in both
capacities is secure and
distinguished.

ture of atomic energy as a
servant of mankind.
Strauss labored indefatiga-
bly to promote both ends.
But other motives en-
tered into the opposition
which are easy to see. The
desire of senators like Ke-
fauver and Gore and O'Ma-
honey to create a govern-
ment monopoly in the gen-
eration and distribution of
electric power has reached
the proportions of a pas-
sion. Other senators are
consumed by the same
zeal.
But the bitter opposition
to him by senators of the
United States has been
based on motives that im-
pair public confidence in
the great institution they
represent. That confidence
has been lessened in the
last few years to a deplor-
able degree.
At the very heart of the
opposition has been the
personal feeling of Sen.
Clinton P. Anderson,
chairman of the Joint Com-
mittee on Atomic Energy.
The very multiplicity of
Anderson's charges casts
doubt upon the strength of
any of them.

When a good prosecutor
has a good case, he can be
content to rest it upon one
or very few facts. How-
ever, in this case almost
every conceivable charge
has been leveled against
the nominee. His integrity,
proved in years of public
affairs, has been assailed.
His capacity has been chal-
lenged, despite the stark
fact that the secretaryship
of commerce is a relatively
unimportant office.
For the Senate to back
such charges is to injure
not Strauss but the Senate
itself.
Perhaps more tact, less
cozening, and more flat-
tery might have created
better relations long ago
when the then AEC chair-
man and the senator were
compelled to deal exten-
sively with each other.
But it should be remem-
bered that the position of
Strauss in the AEC in-
volved immense responsi-
bility and exacting deci-
sions. Not only was the se-
curity of the United States
involved but also the fu-
And on that point,
Strauss was seeking to car-
ry out the declared policy
of Congress and the Presi-
dent to encourage private
investment to assume a
larger and larger part of
the cost of bringing power
generated by the atom to
the services of the people.
Even David Lilienthal,
former chairman of the
AEC and certainly no en-
emy of public power, fa-
vored private develop-
ment. Strauss, with his
long experience in busi-
ness, was well aware of
the vast amounts of pri-
vate investment in the
hands of all sorts of Amer-
icans who might assume
that cost and at once save
taxpayers and prevent
government monopoly in
that field.
The clamor of some
scientists, some commen-
tators, many fellow travel-
ers and their soft-headed
sympathizers for the de-
struction of the man who
assumed major responsi-
bility for removing J. Rob-
ert Oppenheimer from ac-
cess to information vital to
national survival was a
big factor in the opposi-
tion.
In that instance, Strauss
and the others who con-
ducted the examinations
were most diligent to dis-
close all the facts.
Those facts prove to
anyone who reads the rec-
ord that Oppenheimer,
while not a Communist
himself, was, so far as his
associates and connections
were concerned, guilty of
incredibly bad judgment,
to say, the least. And in a
public position involving
the critical struggle be-
tween international com-
munism and human free-
dom, bad judgment is as
dangerous as bad inten-
tions.
No one questioned Op-
penheimer's skill as a sci-
entist. What he lacked
was plain common sense.
And to make matters
worse, his attitude toward
the development of the
hydrogen bomb, a decision
which is not for any sci-
entist to make, has proved
it would have resulted in
a tragic mistake.
Finally, among senators
a petty yearning to play
politics by embarrassing
the President has seemed
to be widespread. In this
case they have been vio-
lating an unwritten rule
that the President is en-
titled to choose his own
cabinet members unless
some gross defect is pres-
ent which would clearly
disqualify the nominee for
the job.
*
Only by the use of gross
imaginings could anyone
say that Strauss is not
qualified by his experience
in business to serve well
in the post. The Senate
even approved of Henry
Wallace for secretary of
commerce, although he
was not only totally inca-
pable of understanding
business but was ideologi-
cally opposed to free en-
terprise.
Further, the Wallace
appointment, as President
Roosevelt said in his let-
ter to Jesse Jones at the
time, was made because
the former vice-president
had labored prodigiously
as a speaker in the 1944
campaign.
All these motives will
scarcely bear favorable ex-
amination in years to come.
