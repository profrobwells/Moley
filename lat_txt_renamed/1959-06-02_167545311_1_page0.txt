Rockefeller's Dwindling Strength
and Nixon's Surging Popularity
If Gov. Rockefeller's
friends, augmented by
Vice-President Nixon's
enemies, attempt the blitz
that worked so successfully
for Wendell Willkie in
1940 and Gen. Eisenhower
in 1952, their major argu-
ment will be that Mr. Nix-
on, if nominated, cannot
be elected. The task will
be much harder in 1959
and 1960 than on the two
earlier occasions.
In 1940, Messrs. Taft
and Dewey were headed
for a deadlock, which
made the entry of a dark
horse most attractive. In
1952, Sen. Taft was not
well managed and, while
he was a statesman of
great caliber, he was not
an accomplished politician.

Neither of these handicaps
will hamper the vice-
president. He will be han-
dicapped by no deadlock
unless the New York gov-
ernor shows strength that
now seems improbable, and
no still darker horse is by
any possible stretch of the
imagination in sight. Nixon
is a much more astute
politician than was Taft
and his prospective man-
agement will be very able,
indeed.
It is also true that Gov.
Rockefeller has none of
the immense prestige pos-
sessed by the conqueror of
Europe. He is an attrac-

tive young man with a
name that has become well
known, with a victory in
New York to his credit.
That is about all.
But close attention will
be paid to all straws in
the wind indicating the
relative public preference
for one or the other of the
two possible Republican
candidates. The Gallup
Polls have shown a stead-
ily continuing gain by the
vice-president since the
November election. The
gap is now very substantial.
The Rockefeller popularity
in New York is much
lower than it was in No-
vember. Private canvasses
show that if there were
a Harriman-Rockefeller
election now, the former
would be elected by a
landslide. Higher taxes
are the main cause of the
disillusionment of New
York voters.
A California poll taken
in April by Consolidated
Facts and summarized in
the Los Angeles Times
shows a heavy preference
for that state's native son,
the vice-president. The
poll covered all of the
state and was weighted to
allow for the larger counties.
Among Republicans, it
shows that Nixon was preferred
by 51%, Rockefeller
by 21%, with the
remainder of "no opinion"
or "others."
On the Democratic side,
where a great majority of
voters are registered, the
relative Nixon-Rockefeller
strength is indicated
by how each is preferred
against Sen. Kennedy and
also Adlai Stevenson.
Running against the Massachusetts
senator, Nixon
would get 39%, Kennedy
47%. Rockefeller
would get 37%, Kennedy
45%. This shows, I believe,
the loose party ties
of registered voters in
California.
*
Against Stevenson and
among Democrats, 42% favor
Nixon and 43% favor
the former Democratic
candidate. Rockefeller
would do slightly better,
with 43% for him and
41% for Stevenson.
A striking thing in these
polls is that even among
Republican members of labor
unions the vice-president
runs ahead of the
New York governor, 38-
26. The Republican women
prefer Nixon by 52-19.
Thus, there are relatively
more Nixon supporters
among women than men.
There are straws in the
wind, but it is clear that
if a Rockefeller movement
is to gain any momentum,
the vice-president must
make some serious blunders
or the New York governor
must perform something
of a miracle.
