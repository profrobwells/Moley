The storm of public
opinion, with congression-
al action impending,
which has followed the in-
defensible Watkins case
may or may not have af-
fected the Supreme Court's
decision in the new Baren-
blatt case: But if ever a
complete reversal of opin-
ion has been demonstrat-
ed, this is it.
It is notable, also, that
the new justice, Potter
Stewart, provided the vital
vote. If this new position
of the court is main-
tained, the possibility of
holding in check by legal
means those members or
supporters of a foul and
alien conspiracy to destroy
our government, and with
it the vitals of our nation,
is greatly strengthened.

Since Barenblatt had
been a teacher in Vassar
College, this opinion
should be ample warning
to the softheaded gentry
who hide behind their
academic robes while they
prey upon the immature
minds of youngsters whom
they profess to teach.
The security of tenure
enjoyed by academic peo-
ple not only implies great
freedom to search for
truth but it also implies
a grave responsibility. For
the greater the security
and freedom a teacher en-
joys, the greater his re-
sponsibility to protect the
integrity of a nation which
has made his position pos-
sible.
In the Watkins case,
there was a flagrant as-
sumption that the court
might not only pass judg-
ment upon the procedural
methods of congressional
committees but also, at
least by implication, deny
Congress the right to de-
termine what should be
investigated. This deci-
sion, together with others,
practically denied Con-
gress as well as the states
the right to decide what
was pertinent to national
security.

The extent to which the
Watkins and other deci-
sions might go if un-
checked is indicated by
the amazing language in
the Black dissent in this
present case. He wrote,
with Warren, Douglas and
Brennan (by implication)
agreeing, that "we cannot
outlaw (the Communist
Party) as a group without
endangering the liberty of
all of us." Then he adds
this statement:
"Once we allow any
group which has some po-
litical aims and ideas to be
driven from the ballot and
from the battle for men's
minds because some of its
members are bad and some
of its tenets are illegal, no
group is safe. Today
Communists or suspected
Communists have been de-
nied an opportunity to
work as government em-
ployees and in just
about any other job. In to-
day's holding they are sin-
gled out and, as a class,
are subjected to inquisi-
tions which the court sug-
gests would be unconstitu-
tional but for the fact of
'communism."
Consider this language.
A band of blackhanders
forms a political or social
club and applies for a
charter, inserting recrea-
tion and cultural develop-
ment among its purposes.
The fact is that among its
stated or proven purposes
is the pooling of the skills
and energies of its mem-
bers to rob, kill and cheat
the public at large. What
this strange Black opinion
is saying is that such an
outfit cannot be sup-
pressed without endanger-
ing all organizations with
recreation and cultural de-
velopment as their pur-
poses.
Why cannot the Com-
munist Party be outlawed?
The nation through its
government sets up the
party system to carry on
the great democratic func-
tion of nominating and
electing its public serv-
ants. Whatever authority a
party has is derived from
such laws. Cannot the leg-
islative authority, federal
and state, which creates
parties determine their
legitimacy?
★
In the case of the Com-
munist Party, we have an
outfit whose proven pur-
pose is to destroy the very
government under which
it's permitted to organize.
To say that some of its ac-
tivities may resemble
those of the Republican
and Democratic Parties is
merely to say that it must
do that in order to qualify
under the purpose of the
law.
But when its legitimacy
is reviewed, all, not some,
of its objectives must be
brought into review. And
such review should be by
the body which created it,
not the Supreme Court of
the United States.
