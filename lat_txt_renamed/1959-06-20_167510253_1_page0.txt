RAYMOND MOLEY
U.S. Stands Firm
on Shipping Policy
With Geneva in most
headlines, there has been
little notice of another international
meeting in
Washington, over a serious
difference between
the United States and European
maritime nations.
The outcome should be
good news to Americans.
For, at long last, the United
States has participated
in an international conference
and emerged completely
victorious.
For some years there
has been bitter criticism
in European shipping circles
concerning the maritime
policies of the United
States. This has been
officially echoed in the
legislative bodies and cabinets
of those countries.
*
Also, there is the International
Transport Workers
Federation, which has
close links with some of
our own not-too-savory
American maritime
unions. All these have
converged in a continuous
attack upon American official
shipping policies.
Three points concern
them: our subsidies to
American ships; our 50-50
law, which requires half
of our giveaway stuff to
be carried in American-
Flag vessels, and our
American-owned ships
which, because of excessive
U.S.-flag costs, are
registered in Liberia, Panama
and Honduras.
The European bitterness
has been intensified
in the past two years because
of a depression in
world shipping. This they
blame upon the foregoing
official policies of the
United States.
*
And so there came to
our State Department in
Washington a large convocation
from Britain, Sweden,
Norway, Denmark,
Belgium, France, West
Germany, and Italy. There
were to be "informal
talks," but their purpose
was to argue, bluster,
bluff our conciliatory State
Department into agreement
with them. But this
time it was Uncle Sam
they had to deal with, not
Uncle Sap.
In a presentation which
was the embodiment of
friendliness and sympathy
with complete firmness
behind it, Undersecretary
Douglas Dillon, heading
the American representatives,
explained and upheld
our policies. There
was no backing away from
any of the three policies.
And so the diplomatic invasion
was repelled decisively.
*
Dillon pointed out that
it was wholly wrong and
unfair to blame American
policies for the depression
in European shipping. The
real cause is that extensive
world-wide shipbuilding
between 1953 and 1957
has knocked out of competition
aged and inefficient
vessels. In addition,
the abnormal demands for
ocean transport characteristic
of post-war needs, the
Korean war, and the Suez
crisis have ended.
So far as our giveaway
cargoes are concerned,
they represent only 6% of
our ocean trade. Furthermore,
American-flag ships
carry only about 15% of
our foreign trade. Thus,
we are providing a very
large amount of business
for the ships of those European
countries.
As for the governmentally-approved
practice of
registering ships in Liberia,
Panama and Honduras,
Dillon said that "we
see no alternative but to
continue on the present
course" until and unless
U.S.-Flag costs can be reduced
to a level competitive
with European shipping.
*
These high costs are
due in large part to the
abnormally high wages of
seamen in American
unions. In short, so far as
oil and iron ore are concerned,
labor costs under
the American flag have
priced unsubsidized American
ships out of operation.
Since the transportation of
these bulk commodities is
vital to our national economy
and defense needs,
the Liberian, Panamanian,
and Honduran flags are
essential to our national
interests.
And so the convocation
of protest from Europe
returned empty handed. It
would be well that they
seek the causes of their
shipping depression in
their own mistaken policies
of the past.
