The Eastland Bill: It Would End
Confusion on Subversion Laws
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The small state of New
Hampshire has been
known from colonial days
for its product of a very
special variety of common
sense. From time to time
its lawyers and jurists
have pierced the web of
legal quibbling and led the
way into the free air of
reality. Nearly 90 years
ago, the Supreme Court of
that state in two famous
decisions broke through a
century or more of confu-
sion about what consti-
tutes insanity as a defense
in criminal actions, with a
workable solution which is
still cited by authorities in
that field.
*
In the much discussed
and criticized case of
Yates et al. v. United
States, decided two years
ago, a quibble appeared in
Mr. Justice Harlan's ma-
jority opinion about what
would constitute a crime
under the Smith Act's pro-
vision making it unlawful
for any person "to know-
ingly or willfully advo-
cate, abet, advise or teach
the duty, necessity, desira-
bility or propriety of over-
throwing or destroying
any government in the
United States by force or
violence."
The Harlan opinion held
in substance that this pro-
vision of the Smith Act
does not prohibit advocacy
and teaching of forcible
overthrow of the govern-
ment as an abstract prin-
ciple, divorced from any
effort to instigate action to
that end.
The case involved 14
members of the Commu-
nist Party in California
and in many respects was
on a level with the famous
Dennis case, which was
tried before Judge Medina
over many tumultuous
months. The convictions
therein were upheld by
the Supreme Court.
It would seem that the
issue comes down to the
immediacy of the incite-
ment to action. If I read
the case correctly, such
teaching or advocacy
would be lawful if it did
not incite to action im-
mediately.
To correct this construc-
tion of the Smith Act,
Sen. Eastland has intro-
duced a bill which would
make such advocacy un-
lawful without regard to
time. This bill, among
others, was created by a
committee of the Ameri-
can Bar Assn. after many
months of labor.
In a statement support-
ing the bill, Atty. Gen.
Louis C. Wyman of New
Hampshire cut through
the cobwebs of the Yates
opinion to the essence of
what was intended by the
Smith Act. Wyman is no
stranger to the problem
involved. He is chairman
of the committee on inter-
nal security of the Nation-
al Assn. of Attorneys Gen-
eral and a member of the
ABA's special committee
on Communist tactics,
strategy and objectives.
He argued the case of
Sweezy vs. New Hamp-
shire and also the Nelson
case before the Supreme
Court, in both of which the
Supreme Court assumed
broad legislative functions.

Wyman said in his state-
ment:
"This play of words (the
Harlan opinion) eviscer-
ated the plain congression-
al intention of the Smith
Act... By the formula
pronounced in Yates et al.
v. United States, it now
seems necessary for gov-
ernment to wait until a
putsch is very close to
reality before it may pros-
ecute... Sedition and sub-
version is neither candy-
making nor lobbying.
Those who argue that
speech is not action in this
field confuse the forest
and the trees. Subversion
of free government is al-
ways preceded by much
speech which, when ex-
tended to intentional advo-
cacy of sedition, must lose
its privileged character or
see judicial invitation to
termites in our constitu-
tional foundation."
Further, in speaking of
the special privileges de-
manded by people in aca-
demic life in the matter of
such advocacy, Wyman
commented that "surely
we cannot have one type
of freedom of speech in
the intellectual community
and another for the aver-
age citizen in public life."
*
In its practical applica-
tion, the law as interpreted
by the Supreme Court in
the Yates case would stop
all efforts by government
to protect our institutions
against communism. For a
conviction after the audi-
ence has been whipped in-
to a howling mob would be
locking the stable after the
loss of the horse. Commu-
nistic action is developed
over a long period of in-
doctrination. To provide
internal security, it is es-
sential that the teaching
be suppressed in its in-
cipient stages. To wait un-
til the trigger has been
pulled is a mere futility.
There must be a means of
prohibiting the loading of
the gun.
