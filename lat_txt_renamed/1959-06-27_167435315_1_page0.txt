The amendment to the
Smith Act which would
give the states concurrent
power to investigate and
punish sedition, embodied
in HR 3 and S 3, was, as
almost everyone knows,
prompted by the Supreme
Court decision two years
ago in the case of Steve
Nelson. In that case, the
validity of the Pennsyl-
vania law was involved.
The hearings on the
Senate bill provided
plenty of argument con-
cerning the inseparability
of state and federal gov-
ernment in protecting gov-
ernment against commu-
nism. Historically, there
was the concept that the
federal government was
our protector against for-
eign enemies, and the
states against "malice do-
mestic."
Communism is the "en-
emy without" and the
"enemy within" as well.
So the common sense of
the matter is that the two
governmental authorities
share indivisibly in the
fight against an insidious
enemy.
It has seemed to me that
more attention might be
given to the plain intent
of the Constitution, which
in Article IV, Section 4,
provides that:
"The United States shall
guarantee to every state
in this Union a republican
form of government, and
shall protect each of them
against invasion, and, on
application of the Legisla-
ture or of the Executive
(when the Legislature
cannot be convened)
against domestic vio-
lence."
In this instance of Com-
munistic sedition it might
be argued that "on appli-
cation," etc., the federal
government should pro-
vide internal security
against the "domestic vio-
lence" inherent in teach-
ing that government
should be overthrown by
force or violence, which is
communism.
But the more important
stricture of this section
is that a "republican form
of government" shall be
guaranteed. How this
guarantee might be en-
forced is not clear. It
might present grave diffi-
culties.
A possible example of
this problem is illustrated
by an incident of which I
was a witness in 1934 or
1935. At a luncheon at
which President Roosevelt,
Atty. Gen. Cummings and
Felix Frankfurter, then a
professor at Harvard, were
present, the question of
Huey Long's practical dic-
tatorship in Louisiana was
discussed. The President
cited the constitutional
provision guaranteeing a
republican form of gov-
ernment and asserted that
certainly Louisiana was
not enjoying such a regime
under Huey Long.
The suggestion was
made that federal forces
might be used to enforce
the guarantee. Both Cum-
mings and Frankfurter in-
terposed heated objections
to such a course, and the
President dropped the sub-
ject. This suggestion was
not seriously made. It was
one of those things he
called his "brainstorms."
But the two lawyers men-
tioned certainly were seri-
ous about their objections.
The answer to the prob-
lem is not federal inter-
ference but authority
within the state not only
to protect its own form of
government but to make
sure that it shall not be a
breeding ground for a na-
tional network.
It is, as Atty. Gen. Louis
C. Wyman of New Hamp-
shire said in the hearings,
"Inconceivable that the
federal government might
be destroyed without also
destroying the safety, se-
curity and sovereignty of
the individual states."
It is also true that it is
inconceivable that the fed-
eral government can be se-
cure without the utmost
co-operative effort with
states toward investigating
and prosecuting subver-
sion, wherever it has its
origin.
This should be clear
even to the quibbling law-
yers who have been oppos-
ing HR 3 and S 3. The de-
cision of the Supreme
Court recently in the case
of Uphaus vs. New Hamp-
shire (which was initiated
and argued by Mr. Wy-
man) clears the atmos-
phere considerably. It held
that a state could "proceed
with prosecutions for sedi-
tion against the state it-
self; that it can legitimate-
ly investigate in this area
follows."
However, since this case
was decided by a bare ma-
jority of one, the only safe
course is an act of Congress
clearly providing that the
states shall have concur-
rent jurisdiction in the
field of sedition.
