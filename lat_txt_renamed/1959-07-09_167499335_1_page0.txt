Red Propaganda Fairs Are Fooling
People Who Should Know Better
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
That the present flurry
of Communist propaganda
through fairs has its vic-
tims is shown by the un-
critical acceptance of it
by some Americans. One
notable commentator who
should know better has
this to say concerning the
Russian exhibit in New
York:
"What the Russians are
saying by their exposition
in New York is that their
own internal development
is their paramount inter-
est. If this is true, as it
appears to be (etc.),
since 1917 there has been a
change in the Communist
doctrine. The current
idea is that the example of
the spectacular develop-
ment of the Soviet Union
will be contagious in the
backward countries in
Asia and Africa."
*
So let us examine this
naive idea in the light of
what Asians actually be-
lieve and also with a re-
minder to ourselves of the
bellowings and threats of
Khrushchev and the long,
fruitless quest for a Ger-
man solution at Geneva.
In May, when a ridicu-
lous claim of industrial
progress came from Com-
munist China, some Ameri-
cans took the stuff seri-
ously. Among the claims
made then were that the
Red Chinese had attained
a production of 12 million
tons of steel. This claim
was for steel, not pig iron.
In Japan, where certain-
ly more is known of what
China is producing that in
any other country on
earın, this claim is an ob-
ject of merriment. Even
Red China's pig iron is,
by the standards of any
modern industrial nation,
worthless stuff.
Moreover, the countries
of Southeast Asia—which
must be the "Asia" men-
tioned by the commentator
quoted above, are rapidly
acquiring a substantial dis-
taste for Communist trade
and for the Red Chinese
government itself.
*
These countries have
found to their regret that
communism can neither
deliver the goods nor abide
by even the elementary
rules of civilized trade in-
tercourse.
Last year, with a great
hullabaloo of propaganda,
the Red Chinese began
what was billed as a "trade
war" with Japan. Large
quantities of low-priced,
government-subsidized,
and low-grade goods were
dumped into Southeast
Asian countries.
Instead of hurting Japan
or winning those countries
to a common front against
the United States, the
"trade" onslaught hurt the
infant industries of the re-
cipient countries and, inci-
dentally, caused trouble in
Communist China.
The government in Pei-
ping flooded Singapore
with bicycles and sewing
machines. Almost imme-
diately this caused a
shortage in China and
there were rumblings of
protest. And so the flow
had to be cut back.
Thailand and Laos have
no trade relations with Red
China and decidedly want
none. Other countries, in-
cluding Burma and Malaya,
have severely cut back
trade with Peiping be-
cause of the dumping prac-
tices.
In many of those coun-
tries traders from Red
China are being firmly told
to get out. In some areas
in Southeast Asia the
dumping of rice, which
China can hardly spare,
has seriously injured the
economies of countries
which must live on rice as
an export item.
*
These countries have al-
so found that in the field
of international trade the
morals of Red China are
so loose that no trader can
safely rely upon promises
of payments or deliveries.
So far as Russia is con-
cerned, it would seem that
with its ally faltering it
should provide some help.
But what with the energy
and industrial production
it requires to impress the
West, there is nothing left
to rescue communism in
Asia.
When will people, in-
cluding somewhat intelli-
gent economists, learn that
"backward" countries gain
only by trading with mod-
ern industrial nations such
as the United States, Ja-
pan and those of Western
Europe. Only by infiltra-
tion and conquest by force
can communism be spread
—never by trade alone!
