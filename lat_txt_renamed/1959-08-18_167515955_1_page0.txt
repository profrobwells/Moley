The Keogh-Simpson bill
(H.R. 10), presents a poser
to almost every American
citizen. There are power-
ful arguments for it by
those who would benefit
- arguments with which
many who would not ben-
fit will agree. There are
also strong arguments
against it—arguments
made in particular by the
U.S. Treasury.
This piece is merely to
state the case and the
argument, for whoever
may be interested. My dis-
interest stems not only
from the fact that I would
personally not benefit. I
must admit—and some
readers may smile—that I
am unable to form a clear
judgment on the matter.

The bill would enable all
individuals who pay Social
Security self-employment
taxes to defer federal in-
come tax payments on
sums up to 10% of their
annual self-employment
earnings, or $2,500, which-
ever is the smaller amount,
provided they set aside
that sum in approved
private insurance com-
panies or trust companies
for annuities after the age
of 65. There would be a
lifetime ceiling of $50,000
on such deductions.
This would affect 7,500,-
000 persons—lawyers, doc-
tors, public accountants,
realtors, farmers, inde-
pendent writers, members
of the New York Stock Ex-
change and others. It
should be noted that most
of these self-employed
were not under regular

Social Security until a
few years ago.
The Treasury is against
the bill for several rea-
sons. First it would mean
the loss of $365 million in
federal revenue, no small
item in these days when
a balanced budget is so
desirable. Next, it would
set a precedent because
there would still be some
32 million employees of
small businesses who are
not covered by private
company pension plans
and who have nothing to
provide for their old age
but their Social Security
payments.
If they should also be
blanketed under the Ke-
ogh-Simpson plan—and
there is sentiment for that
—the Treasury loss would
be $1.2 billion. If all tax-
payers were allowed such
an exemption, the loss
would be $3 billion. Oppo-
nents also say that this
is obnoxious because it is
"class legislation."
One need not bother
about this "class legisla-
tion" talk. Congress has
been passing class legisla-
tion for many years. The
first income tax law was
class legislation because it
failed to cover large ele-
ments in the population.
The original Social Se-
curity Act was class legis-
lation in that it failed to
cover millions just as de-
serving as those who
would benefit. How about
farm supports, public
housing and much of the
rest of the welfare legisla-
tion on the books?
Supporters of the Ke-
ogh-Simpson bill argue
that these self-employed
have no such protection as
the corporate pension
plans, which already take
a $7 billion bite from rev-
enues. Some of the bene-
ficiaries of these corporate
plans make a great deal
of money, much more than
a majority of the self-em-
ployed.
It is also argued that
the Keogh-Simpson plan
would be anti-inflationary
because it would channel a
lot of money into insur-
ance companies and banks
and then be available for
investment in job-and-
profit—producing indus-
try.

Moreover, a consider-
able part of the savings
would be invested in fed-
eral bonds, which certain-
ly need buyers now. It al-
so is argued that it would
encourage self-help
through thrift, certainly a
greatly neglected virtue
these days when most of
us are living on futures.
There are the argu-
ments. Take your choice.
My own observation is
that we shall have more
and more "class legisla-
tion" until all are getting
benefits and security. Then
there will be no security
for anyone.
To drag out a sentence
I have used many times
before, "You can subsidize
some of the people all the
time, and all of the peo-
ple some of the time, but
you can't subsidize all of
the people all of the time."
I wrote that 10 years ago,
but now I am wondering
about it.
