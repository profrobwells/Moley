Conservatives Well Organized
for British Election Next Month
The political chips are
down in Britain for a bat-
tle for control of the gov-
ernment during the next
five years. Seizing the best
of all moments for a test,
Prime Minister Macmillan
has called on the queen,
who, in turn, will dissolve
Parliament, and an elec-
tion for members of the
House of Commons will
follow on Oct. 8. An elec-
tion must be held before
next May, which would
terminate the term of the
House elected in that
month in 1955. British cus-
tom gives the party in
power the advantage of
fixing the specific moment
and that responsibility
rests upon the prime min-
ister.
Every practical consid-
eration favored Macmil-
lan's choice of a date. The
Khrushchev visit will be
done and the President no
doubt will be cogitating
whether a summit meet-
ing will be held. Or he
will have decided to have
one. This is regarded in
Britain as an event de-
voutly to be wished. By
Oct. 8 no one will know
what a summit will ac-
complish, but hopes will
still be high in the British
heart.
I was in England when
the campaign was going
on in 1955 (as I shall be
next month). In the midst
of the campaigning then

the President's announce-
ment of his willingness to
meet the heads of state in
Geneva contributed a mil-
lion votes to the Conserva-
tives' cause. By the time
the Geneva meeting was
over, with disappointing
results, the Conservatives
were safely installed for
five years, barring a great
crisis which sometimes
wrecks, untimely, any gov-
ernment.
partially remedied by the
more or less cordial rela-
tions between Hugh Gaits-
kell and Aneurin Bevin.
The real difficulty of the
Labor Party is in finding
some new dress for an old
and shopworn socialism.
Nationalization has been
tried and the British peo-
ple found it wanting.
The trade unions have
been restive under the
burden of supporting a
political party which
seemed to be going no-
where. Unpopular strikes
have broken out, to the
great inconvenience of the
public.
Later, Macmillan suc-
ceeded the ailing Sir An-
thony Eden. For a period
after the latter's resigna-
tion and the Suez crisis
the fortunes of the Con-
servative government
were very low indeed. But
Macmillan, who seemed
strikingly like a typical
stuffy statesman, has
proved to be a remarkable
leader. Except for an oc-
casional revolt by individ-
uals, he has kept his par-
ty together.
R. A. Butler, the sec-
ond in importance in the
party, is a master of fi-
nances and general com-
prehension of govern-
mental affairs. Prosperity
has blessed the countryâ€”
a condition which always
helps. And while the
United States has held in
check the British desire
to concede a lot to the So-
viet and Red China, Mac-
millan has held firm the
Anglo-American ties.
The Labor Party has
been torn by dissent, only

But most important in
the advantage of the Brit-
ish Conservatives is their
party organization. This
began to be apparent in
the reversal of 1950 and in
the campaigns of 1951 and
1955. The Labor Party
simply has been unable to
maintain a trained, effi-
cient organization in the
constituencies. What I saw
of it in 1955 was a sad
sight.
On the other hand, the
Conservative local organi-
zations are alive, compe-
tent, with well-educated
and politically trained,
year-around agents. This
is the assurance that every
potentially sympathetic
voter is reached and fol-
lowed up. This, as the
AFL-CIO COPE has shown
in this country, is indis-
pensable to success.
