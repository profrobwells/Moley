Congress Invites Disaster Through
Failure to Act on Interest Rates
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
DALLAS, Tex. — The
"new" Eisenhower who
has resolutely taken mat-
ters into his own hands
was not created by the ab-
sence of Sherman Adams
or his approach to the end
of his terms as President.
He has within these past
six months been moving
under the threat of a real
financial disaster to the
country.
And no one is more re-
sponsible for bringing him
to this realization, after
six years of pretty expen-
sive policies, than his Tex-
as secretary of the treas-
ury, Robert Anderson. His
vetoes of spending bills
are secondary to his battle
with Congress to take the
ceiling from the interest
rate on government bonds.
For this is the very heart
of a financial storm that
is bearing down upon us
by the day.
No one has so clearly
made this plain to him and
to Congress as has the
Treasury secretary, who,
in his home city down
here, is a man who knows
what he is about and who
has the capacity to ex-
plain financial affairs in
terms that everyone can
understand.
In June the President
sent an urgent message to
Congress saying that the
credit of the government
required that the legal
ceiling on the interest
rates of the 4¼% long-
term marketable bonds
and the 3.26% limit on
Savings Bonds should be
removed, with discretion
in the administration to
fix these according to the
conditions prevailing in
the market for money.
Two days later Secre-
tary Anderson presented
to the House Ways and
Means Committee one of
the finest and most rea-
sonably clear statements
on financial policy that has
appeared in recent years.
For two critical months
Congress, busy with poli-
tics and little raids on the
Treasury, ignored this ad-
vice. Things were getting
worse, and on Aug. 12
the House Ways and
Means Committee tenta-
tively approved the prin-
ciples presented in bills
by Reps. Simpson of Penn-
sylvania, a Republican,
and Harrison, a Virginia
Democrat. These bills
would have met the Presi-
dent's recommendations.
*
A week later the com-
mittee changed its mind
and decided to do noth-
ing. On that same day
the secretary sharply
warned the committee of
its dangerous delay, say-
ing:
"A nation cannot af-
ford to sit idly by at a
time of rising levels of
business activity and allow
a situation to continue in
which both the fact and
the fear of inflation can
be generated.
"We have tried to make
clear that under present
restrictions the govern-
ment in the management
of the debt can actively
contribute to the inflation-
ary pressures by being
confined to short-term fi-
nancing, which, the short-
er it gets, is more like
money." He might have
said "printing money," for
that is about what it
amounts to.
The President followed
with a more urgent mes-
sage, saying that "no is-
sue of greater importance
has come before this ses-
sion of Congress." He
again urged action on his
earlier recommendation.
*
The committee labored
for a few days and brought
forth a mouse of a bill
which a minority of the
members condemned in a
very strong report. It re-
moved the ceiling on the
Savings Bonds, which are
only one-seventh of the na-
tional debt, but did noth-
ing about other long-term
securities.
In the Senate the size of
the mouse was reduced
still more. The critical
days ahead may well com-
pel the President to call
Congress into special ses-
sion. Perhaps such a spec-
tacular move will be the
only means of bringing
public attention to the
most serious problem be-
fore us all.
Interest rates on govern-
ment securities are not
just a technical question
of concern only to banks,
life insurance companies
and the government. They
are a grave threat to all
of us. In another column
I shall attempt to make
that clear.
