RAYMOND MOLEY:
Space Shots Create
Cosmic Complexes
WITH RAYMOND MOLEY JR.
The cosmic complexity
of considerations and im-
plications of Soviet and
American probes into
space may be too much
for laymen to comprehend.
But we should be spared
certain misconceptions
concerning U.S. and So-
viet progress in this field.
For a good deal of our
income is being devoted to
the race into space, and
now that the Russians
have slammed a larger ve-
hicle into the craters of
the moon, there will be
greater pressure to launch
"crash programs" to over-
take the high-flying Slavs.
First, it should be un-
derstood that U.S. scien-
tists are by no means in
accord as to how far ahead
the Soviets are in time.
Chiefs of rocket projects
naturally desire greater
appropriations with which
to advance their undertak-
ings and are inclined to
emphasize "the Soviet
lead."
Unquestionably,
the propaganda or public
relations impact of being
"first" is great. Mr. Khru-
shchev, whose sense of
timing is superb, has man-
aged to incorporate the
achievements of Soviet
rocketry into his travels.
A prominent scientist
here has made the inter-
esting point that the prop-
aganda value of hitting
the moon is far greater
and more important to the
ruling class of the USSR
as it affects their own sub-
jects. It "proves" advance
to a people who have been
deprived of many things
to make such an advance
possible.
Surely, it may even
have an adverse effect on
communism's interests in,
let us say, the United
States. For it spurs us to
more frenzied efforts in
perfecting our defenses
and weapons system.
Also important is the
point that we are more
pragmatic in our approach
to scientific matters. Prop-
aganda has great value
and has received too little
attention in free societies.
But there are other con-
siderations. American sci-
ence and engineering must
be applied to satisfy a
free people and its repre-
sentatives. Utility receives
emphasis here.
The Soviets made their
play for huge rockets years
ago and came up with out-
standing space fuels. On
the other hand, they en-
joyed the initiative in
knowing where and when
they might instigate ten-
sions and trouble and how
far they could go.
Against this the United
States has had to develop
a multitude of weapons
systems to meet any
emergency. It may be ar-
gued in the future that the
fact that the United States
could do so and stay so
close to the totalitarian
development of space mis-
siles is the most remark-
able achievement.

Much of the free world
has remained free because
of the versatility of our de-
fense. Thanks to superb
developments in Navy,
Air Force and Army weap-
ons, it may be said that
our limited military forces
exercise an enormous de-
terrent influence.
Think, too, of the almost
single-minded attention
Mr. Khrushchev has given
to exploiting what is really
a limited application of sci-
ence and engineering.
The massive profile of
science has many aspects.
But what outstanding
achievement in the soli-
tude of the biochemist's
or medical researcher's
laboratory can compete
with the space vehicle
which may be viewed from
rooftops, photographed,
given great dramatic treat-
ment on newspapers' front
pages to stir the public's
imagination.

Further, the broad ap-
plication of forward steps
in science, engineering,
medicine and other fields
to the well-being of entire
populations simply does
not have the "it" of Buck
Rogers science fiction come
to life.
In a republic there are
many calls upon the na-
tional issue. To survive,
politicians must meet or
make the gesture of at-
tempting to meet these de-
mands. In a socialist state
of the Soviet type such
considerations may be giv-
en short shrift. There,
minimal concessions to a
people unused to an abun-
dant material life will sur-
fice.
