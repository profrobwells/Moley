RAYMOND MOLEY:
Sen. Lyndon Johnson
Ready, Able, Willing
WITH RAYMOND MOLEY JR..
If, as in the years in the
early 1800s, "King Caucus"
reigned in Washington,
Lyndon Baines Johnson,
senior senator from Texas
and majority leader, would
be so far ahead for the
1960 Democratic nomina-
tion that Sens. Kennedy,
Humphrey and Symington
would be well advised to
save their money and
breath.
★
For the Texan has the
great advantage as a Pres-
idential hopeful of the fa-
vor of those who know him
best, the Democratic mem-
bers of Congress. This is
no small tribute to his in-
credible energy, his skill
as a parliamentarian, his
sense of justice and bal-
ance and his capacity to
reconcile almost hopeless-
ly divergent points of view
in a party which is held to-
gether only by a long-es-
tablished trade name.
Political opponents who
have had high place in the
opposition party, such as
former Sen. Knowland and
Vice President Nixon, re-
spect and personally find
a measure of agreement
with Johnson on methods.
Such favorable attri-
butes and advantages led
many observers to believe
in 1955 that Johnson was
a natural choice for the
Democrats in 1956. But a
year before the convention
the unbelievable drive and
labors of the senator laid
him low with a serious
heart attack.
★
Nothing remained but
the shopworn veteran of
the 1952 battle, Adlai Ste-
venson. After a convales-
cence, Johnson resumed
his work, but this was not
sufficiently convincing to
attract the delegates who
had already seen physical
liabilities in President Ei-
senhower as ready made
for opposition argument
for the election of a
healthy Democrat.
Johnson can hardly be
said to have emerged from
the first session of this
Congress as a Wellington
or a Frederick the Great.
But without him, the bat-
tle of the budget would
have ended in a rout. If
comparisons are needed to
prove this, note the utter
impotence of Speaker Ray-
burn in the House of Rep-
resentatives during the
last months of the session.
He, too, had a big numeri-
cal majority.
There is a great deal of
unhappiness among Dem-
ocratic professionals over
the country about the crop
of availables for 1960. And
with the old boast that
"Nixon would be easiest to
beat" revealed as a form
of dancing in a bomb shel-
ter and with Nixon rising
rapidly in public esteem,
those professionals are
finding many reasons why
Kennedy, Humphrey and
Symington are not first-
rate prospects.
One of those profession-
als said recently that the
Democratic Messiah might
well be a "dark, dark
horse." Others are taking
a second look at a horse of
another color but pretty
well worn, Adlai Steven-
son. And a good many are
calculating that, despite
actuarial risks, Johnson
might be the best sort of
compromise.
★
Lyndon Johnson in his
early public life in Texas
and later in the House of
Representatives could on-
ly be classed as a garden
variety of New Dealer. He
was regular and he voted
for every radical measure
in those years except when
the interests of his con-
servative state were con-
cerned..
Many Texans have re-
cently discerned what they
believe to be a conserva-
tive metamorphosis - a
"new Lyndon," as they
say.
He is a man of property
--plenty of it. (It is inter-
esting to note that four
of the five Presidential
possibilities of the "poor
man's party" -- Kennedy,
Symington, Stevenson and
Johnson -- are far from
poor themselves.)
★
Johnson pays plenty of
attention to the business
leaders of his state, is in-
defatigable in caring for
their chores, and answers
their letters. But in the
AFL-CIO COPE score book
he voted "right" in every-
thing except civil rights
and specific issues of in-
terest to his state,
Despite his drive and en-
ergy--no man in Congress
has ever worked so hard--
and with no apparent im-
pairment of his health, the
issue of health will be im-
portant in 1960. For the
memory of the Eisenhower
vigil is still vivid.
