Stanford's Hoover Institution
Bulwarks Faith in U.S. Ideals
Forty-five years ago,
Herbert Hoover terminat-
ed his highly successful
career in business and en-
gineering. The long-smol-
dering embers of tension
in Europe had burst into
a flame, and nation after
nation was drawn into the
orbit of war. The past was
receding and no one
knew what the future
might be.
Mr. Hoover at 40 had
already learned much
about the peoples of the
world, their trials, aspira-
tions and prejudices. With
all that he had of energy,
intelligence and the les-
sons of experience, he re-
solved that in public serv-
ice he might appraise the
forces that had destroyed
the peace and that had
precipitated the revolu-
tionary changes that were
ahead.
*
The many busy years
that followed rewarded
him with a vast knowl-
edge of the forces and
tensions that have afflict-
ed his generation. With a
firm faith that if human-
ity could understand more
clearly what these condi-
tions were there might be
a better future, he made
it his business, while in
public service and after-
ward, to gather such rec-
ords as were available and
concentrate them in an
institution suitably
equipped for their inter-
pretation.
From that, there grew
the Hoover Institution of
War, Revolution and Peace
at Stanford University.
There are now safely as-
sembled there 40 million
documents, books, and

other items gathered
through Hoover's world-
wide contacts and prodi-
gious industry.
The institution is not a
mere repository of histori-
cal material. Its major ob-
jective is to interpret
those records through the
skill and scholarship of
many students and to
publish whatever of wis-
dom might be produced.
*
The creation and devel-
opment of this institution
have been the crowning
public service of a highly
useful life. Upon the di-
rector rests not only the
responsibility of conserv-
ing and enlarging the ma-
terial, but the selection
and supervision of the
students who will provide
its interpretation.
After a comprehensive
search for the right man,
the president and trustees
of Stanford have, with the
approval of Mr. Hoover,
selected Dr. Glenn Camp-
bell as director. After re-
ceiving his doctorate in
economics at Harvard, Dr.
Campbell was a member
of the faculty there for
five years.
His work since has been
the direction and publica-
tion of research projects.
Members of Congress have
good reason to know him
because of the many
analyses of measures com-
ing before Congress, pre-
pared under Dr. Camp-
bell's direction by the
American Enterprise
Assn. in Washington.
Hard pressed legislators
have found these analyses
invaluable in making their
judgments and casting
their votes.
It will be in the direc-
tion of a great many re-
search projects that the
new director of the Hoover
Institution will be mainly
engaged. Scholars and
writers will be brought to
the institution who will
prepare for publication
studies of the great prob-
lems facing the nations
and their people, using
the material collected
there as their source.
According to the plans
of Mr. Hoover, these stud-
ies will concern the causes
of war, the impact of war
on nations, the effect of
war in producing revolu-
tionary changes in govern-
ments and societies, the
well-known cycle of infla-
tion, revolution, dictator-
ship and war.
Notable will be studies
of the destruction of polit-
ical and economic free-
dom, and the rise of
strange ideologies such as
communism and fascism.

Essentially, the purpose
of the institution is to sus-
tain the ideals and institu-
tions cherished in the
United States, including
its form of constitutional
government, its principles
of economic freedom, and
its important co-operative
efforts toward the raising
of the standards of life of
the people.
In a word, the work of
the Hoover Institution
will be to provide, by in-
formation and suggestion,
the means by which Amer-
icans may guide their
course to escape the fate-
ful errors which have de-
stroyed freedom in so
many countries in the
past, especially in the near
past. Such an institution
with such purposes is
unique in this country and
perhaps in the world.
