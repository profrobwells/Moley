WOE IN MICHIGAN
Ironic Fate Dooms
a Presidential Hope
BY RAYMOND MOLEY AND
RAYMOND MOLEY JR.
It must be the source
of bitter irony to G. Men-
nen Williams that, al-
though the talents and
theories he has in abun-
dance are the very ones
which leading Democratic
Presidential hopefuls in
the North all share, he is
not among them.
Also, those men - Ken-
nedy, Symington and
Humphreys — all come
from the U.S. Senate,
while he is governor of a
large state. And a so-
called "law" of politics
has held that a governor's
chair makes a better
springboard than a seat in
our highest legislative
chamber.
For years Mr. Williams
has been regarded as
Presidential timber of
rich liberal grain. He is
attractive, young after a
decade as Michigan's chief
executive, and he has
traveled widely to make
himself known. He is
close to leaders of the
Democratic left and has
served his party faithful-
ly.
He governs a state rich-
ly endowed with the in-
dustrial prowess that has
come to be known
throughout the world as
an epitome of American
strength. Michigan's as-
sembly lines are emulated
in Osaka, Coventry, Wolfs-
burg, Gorki, and Milan.
Advanced techniques,
brilliant management, and
skilled labor in industry
join with a thriving agri-
cultural economy to place
Michigan high on the list
of wealthy states.
But for years, under the
magnetic leadership of
Mennen Williams, the
state has wallowed and
now struggles in the fis-
cal quicksand of the wel-
fare state. Some time ago
the munificence of Mr.
Williams' 10-year adminis-
tration overtook state rev-
enues and borrowing pow-
er and, since, a desperate
scramble has gone on to
discharge financial com-
mitments.
By last February three
months had gone by with
state universities receiv-
ing no funds. No money
went into the teachers'
retirement fund. Mr. Wil-
liams, always close to
union leaders, receiving
their powerful political
backing and, in turn, ad-
vocating and pushing
through the state Legisla-
ture all varieties of pro-
grams which run the
gamut of the. AFL-CIO
"progressive" state,
turned to his erstwhile
targets—the corporations.
They advanced tax pay-
ments not due until June.
But this resolved nothing.
Soon the state's cash posi-
tion was as it had been 19
months ago when the Citi-
zens Research Council de-
clared, "In plain words,
this is what is known as
bankruptcy." Banks have
refused to loan further
funds to state activities
they consider questionable.
Since Mr. Williams' first
term, government spend-
ing has doubled. Besides
excessive services of its
own, the state has as-
sumed municipal responsi-
bilities when Detroit and
other communities ap-
proached bankruptcy on
their own.
How shall responsibility
be apportioned? For years
many people in the state
lived in the sunny but de-
ceptively dangerous cli-
mate of deficit finance. Cer-
tainly Mr. Williams and
Mr. Walter Reuther share
more responsibility than
they care to assume.
Then, too, Gus Sholle,
president of the 700,000-
member Michigan AFL-
CIO, has moved with pow-
er and assurance among
legislators who are aware
of his vast political influ-
ence. The Legislature has
blithely passed most of the
governor's spending re-
quests.
The state constitution is
condemned in some quar-
ters as being inelastic and
restrictive, earmarking
funds from certain reve-
nue sources.
Since summer a biparti-
san committee has had
frustrating and exhausting
hearings in which all man-
ner of taxes have been con-
sidered. Republicans have
favored putting an in-
crease in the sales tax be-
fore the people. Mr. Wil-
liams and the unions talk
in terms of greater cor-
porate taxes and a state
income tax.
It may be very well to
maintain a senate voting
record for greater spend-
ing and government serv-
ices. Apparently this does
not detract from a man's
chances for the Democrat-
ic nomination. But for
G. Mennen Williams, who
has actually put these
theories in practice, it
means eclipse.
