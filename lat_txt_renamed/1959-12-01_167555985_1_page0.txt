Local Goodwill Is the Source
of a Party's National Strength
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the memoirs of Lord
Woolton, recently published in England, that
great party leader tells of
the efforts he made in rebuilding the Conservative
Party in the town and city
councils. This, he believes, was an essential
preliminary to the recapture of the House of Commons after six years of Labor control.
Woolton came to his job
in politics at the insistence of Winston Churchill
after the disastrous defeat
in 1945. He had not been
a strict party man in previous years. His only experience in government
was as food minister in
the war.
*
During the 20 years before 1940 he had been the
managing director of a big
national chain store business. Some of that business experience he applied successfully to politics. Goodwill in the local
community is indispensable to building up
the acceptance of a national product or a national
party.
While a generation of
reformers in the United
States has decried partisanship in local politics,
the strength of the national
parties has ebbed away.
For if the citizens of the
nation at the local level
are indoctrinated in the
idea that a Republican or
Democrat in local politics
is a bad person, the capacity of local leaders of
the party to get out the
vote in a national election
is destroyed.
In fact, Woolton found
that service in local councils by young Conservatives was the best sort of
training for candidates for
Parliament.
One of the main factors
that contributed to the defeat of Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey was his failure to
stand up and fight for his
party against President
Truman's demagogic attacks upon the 80th Congress. That Congress had
a record which could be
easily defended. Among
its pieces of legislation
was the Taft-Hartley Act.
After the adjournment
of Congress, there was no
word from the titular leader
of the party in Albany.
In December, a friend
argued with Dewey about
his silence, but the answer was that he was not
the leader of Congress.
This indifference to his
party, which was then in
control of Congress, chilled not only the members of that party but
thousands of local leaders.
No candidate can succeed
with that sort of apathy,
and everyone knows the
story of that following
November.
Since Nelson Rockefeller, in his campaign for
the governorship and in
the appointments he has
made since, has appeared
indifferent to his party in
New York state, there is a
lack of enthusiasm in local
organizations over the
state.
Some of the chickens
came home to roost in
this year's election for
local offices. In upstate
New York the Democrats
have now won a majority
of councilmen in the cities,
and in the counties the
number of Republican
supervisors — similar to
county commissioners in
some states—has declined.
The number of Democrats on county boards of
supervisors increased
from 416 after the 1957
election to 484 after the
election just held.

There had been Democratic gains in the elections of 1955 and 1957, but
in those years a Democrat
was in the governorship,
with the ample patronage
of his office to help local
organizations. Some gains
in local elections were inevitable.
But with the Republican Rockefeller in Albany
there has been no chance
to improve things, and the
Republican loss in 1959
was as great as in 1955
and 1957 combined.
Judson Morhouse, Republican state chairman
who is promoting the Presidential candidacy of the
governor, says that these
Republican losses are "local" matters. That is true,
but it is also true that
Presidents are elected by
votes cast in local areas.
