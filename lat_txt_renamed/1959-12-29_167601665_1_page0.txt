Drug Firms Need Investigating,
but Kefauver Isn't the Right Man
Perhaps. it is the sure
instinct with which Sen.
Estes Kefauver finds his
way to a treasure of rich
ore for headline making,
perhaps it is lack of in-
dustry by other members
of Congress that has made
the man from Tennessee
the unfortunate choice for
an inquiry in a field which
most people will agree
needs investigation.
Certain drugs are in-
deed very expensive. Their
high cost is a deterrent to
an improvement in the
nation's health which all
cagerly hope for. A heavy
burden of proof rests upon
the drug industry to ex-
plain how and why costs to
the consumer are so high.
But in fairness to all,
such an investigation
should be conducted by
someone less distinguished
by his disposition to initi-
ate an inquiry with prej-
udice and, by acting as
judge and prosecutor at
the same time, to obscure
rather than clarify the
facts.

Kefauver's investigation
of crime, which mounted
his Presidential candidacy
several years ago, was a
mere rehashing of old
stuff which resulted in not
a single constructive piece
of legislation. Likewise,
his automobile and steel
probes ended in confusion.
Perhaps, as he would
answer, this drug show
will cause the industry
and the medical profes-
sion to reconsider their
own problems. But to
drive them into a corner

hy exaggerated testimony
and by the Kefauver
methods in the inquiry
may well create only a de-
fensive attitude which can
help no one.
The investigation as it
is being conducted will
most certainly provide
arguments for the worst
of all remedies, socialized
medicine.
The objections to the
Tennessee senator's meth-
ods are these:
Headlines are created by
tossing a juicy bit into the
hearings in mid-morning
for the afternoon press
and in mid-afternoon for
the morning papers.

Witnesses from the
drug industry are either
prevented from or serious-
ly curtailed in a funda-
mental right of an accused
to make his own prelim-
inary statement in such
form or at such length as
he might legitimately
need.
Instead of summoning
a representative of all
physicians as a profession-
al group, single members
whose testimony supports
the Kefauver indictment
are chosen.
By using his authority
as master of ceremonies,
the senator diverts wit-
nesses from presenting a
telling reply. This was
true of the senator when
the representative of
Schering was diverted
from showing the compar-
isons between the raw ma-
terial costs and the retail
selling prices of an extend-
ed list of products.
There are always dis-
gruntled members of any
business, professional, or
other group who have
axes to grind. These ex-
ceptions are given undue
prominence. Reckless and
deceptive figures of prof-
its are permitted to ap-
pear, with little or no op-
portunity for correction
before they reach the
headlines.

Reading into the record
of selected items out of
context has been common
practice.
A fair investigation
might bring out the argu-
ments on both sides for the
question whether high
costs of producing one
product should be spread
over all the products of a
company or should be con-
fined to a specific drug.
In this investigation, as
has been true of Kefau-
ver's attack upon the auto-
mobile and electric power
industries, the presump-
tion is that advertising is a
wicked and expendable
item in costs. A trade name
made generally known to
the public is a validly held
possession of a company,
and advertising of the
product serves to help all
producers of similar prod-
ucts. Such promotion may
or may not be an excessive
charge to the consumer.
This investigation will
leave that question ex-
actly where it found it.
The high cost of keep-
ing well is a subject which
needs fair inquiry. But this
investigation is never go-
ing to meet that need.
