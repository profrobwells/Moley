Mr. Ford's Lavish Party Remindful
of What Mr. Veblen Had to Say
We have been told in
the society columns about
Detroit's "Party of the
Century." It was a sort of
"coming out party" for the
daughter of Henry Ford
II.
I am going to cite two
authorities on this item.
One is a contemporary,
Cholly Knickerbocker,
that peerless Plutarch of
plutocracy. The other is a
man whom possibly nei-
ther Mr. Knickerbocker
nor Mr. Ford ever heard
about, Thorstein Veblen.
The former tells us that
the party cost between
$150,000 and $250,000. It
began with the employ-
ment of a French decora-
tor. The Detroit Country
Club was transformed into
a series of symbolic, splen-
diferous rooms.
One was Greek, which
remainds us, although not
the decorator, of how the
barbarians lusted for that
fair country.
Another was medieval,
with armorial trappings
and tapestries. This should
remind us of the feudal
concept of possession of
Henry Ford, grandpere.
Another, perhaps most
significant of all, was like
a Garden of Versailles,
which has a way of bring-
ing up the splendor and
unhappy fate of Louis XVI
of Bourbon and his queen,
Marie Antoinette of Aus-
tria.
From far and near came
the guests, representatives
of other feudal realms,
odds and ends of Euro-
pean nobility, Hollywood
stars, and Mr. Ford's com-
petitors in the automobile
industry.
Ladies far from home
are often the victims of
stringy locks, and so fa-

mous hairdressers were
imported from New York
to fix things up for them.
Flower shops in and
around Detroit were able
to dispose of their stock
in one fell swoop.
According to the chron-
icler, Mr. Knickerbocker,
"cases and cases of cham-
pagne were consumed...
in fact they say that Hen-
ry Ford completely emp-
tied New York of this
vintage." Hard going for
Christmas parties from
the Battery to Pocantico
Hills and Fairfield County,
Conn. The principal ladies
were decked out by
French couturiers.

And now to cite what
Veblen wrote almost ex-
actly 60 years ago:
"Conspicuous consump-
tion of valuable goods is a
means of reputability.
as wealth accumulates on
his hands, his own unaid-
ed effort will not avail suf-
ficiently to put his opu-
lence in evidence by this
method."
"The aid of friends and
competitors is therefore
brought in by resorting to
the giving of valuable
presents and expensive
fetes and entertainments
The competitor with
whom the entertainer
wishes to institute a com-
parison is, by this method,
made to serve as a means
to the end.
"He consumes vicar-
iously for his host at the
same time that he is a
witness to the consump-
tion of that excess of good
things which his host is
unable to dispose of single-
handed." (Knickerbocker
mentions top executives
from General Motors,
Chrysler and American
Motors as guests.)
"So long as the commu-
nity or social group,"
wrote Veblen, "is small
enough and compact
enough to be effectively
reached by common no-
toriety alone that is to
say, so long as the human
environment to which the
individual is required to
adapt himself in respect of
reputability is comprised
within his sphere of per-
sonal acquaintance and
neighborhood gossip (say,
Detroit) so long the one
method is about as effec-
tive as the other.
"But when the differen-
tiation has gone further
and it becomes necessary
to reach a wider human
environment... the
means of communication
and the mobility of the
population now expose
the individual to the obser-
vation of many persons
who have no other means
of judging his reputability
than the display of goods.."

Knickerbocker notes
that "naturally the cream
of Detroit was there, but
friends of Ford flew in
from New York, Palm
Beach, Philadelphia, Bos-
ton, California and even
Europe."
If Mr. Ford will ask
some economist in his
foundation to inform him,
he will learn that Veblen
was one of the two econo-
mists of this century with
most influence in the
teaching of the subject in
the colleges and schools.
Hundreds of little Veb-
lens are teaching our chil-
dren. And the greatest and
unforgettable book of Veb-
len is the one from which
the foregoing items are
quoted. No doubt, Walter
Reuther, too, is familiar
with Veblen--and with
Knickerbocker.
