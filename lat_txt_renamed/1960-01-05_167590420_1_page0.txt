RAYMOND MOLEY:
Per Capita Drinking
in U.S. Takes a Drop
The aching heads of
many New Year's cele-
brants may not have real-
ized it possible the day
after, but the annual per
capita consumption of al-
coholic beverages is less
than when their fathers
were boys. Perhaps the
delirious effects of such
consumption on New
Year's Eve which we wit-
nessed were, after all, due
not to the quantity of the
stuff but the quality of
those who consumed it.
★
Modern heads may be
too easily befuddled and
hearts "too soon made
glad." That may be evi-
dence of the deterioration
we hear so much about.
But the data published
by the home economics
bureau of the Northwest-
ern National Life Insur-
ance Co. are always valid.
They say that in the pe-
riod 1906-1910 the annual
per capita consumption of
alcoholic beverages was 22
gallons, including 20 gal-
lons of beer and ale, half a
gallon of wine and six
quarts of hard liquors. The
estimated consumption in
1959 was 17 gallons per
capita, including 15 gal-
lons of beer, nearly a gal-
lon of wine and five quarts
of hard stuff.
Comparative expend-
itures are meaningless,
considering taxes and in-
flation.
But before we take this
to mean that we are sober-
ing up, it will be well to
remind ourselves that
there are relatively more
babies per capita or cou-
ple or family now.
On the other hand, there
are probably more drink-
ers than before, since
women now have their
rights — all of them and
more.
★
Back in those pastoral
days of peace when Taft
was in the White House, a
lady who drank was no
longer considered a lady.
Women's sobriety, ac-
cording to the statistics,
was no restraint on men.
But women were mostly
against liquor.
Those of us who were
raised in the country or
small towns will remem-
ber the half-pint under the
seat cushion in the buggy.
In between dances, the
covert nip was immediate-
ly smothered by quantities
of Sen Sen or cloves, lest
partners might detect the
hated odor. Such olfactory
detection resulted in many
a tiff or broken engage-
ment.
Now, since the women's
rights movement has pre-
vailed, women have sur-
rendered their moral re-
sponsibility for errant
men. They have become
active partners in the mis-
chief. The "permissive
home" has come into be-
ing with loosely held rules
about the age of discre-
tion.
Perhaps economic con-
siderations will compel
men to shoulder once more
that corrective and protec-
tive role which women's
rights denied them. The
stuff is costly. A college
boy whom I know was
taken to a Christmas party
by a classmate. (Nowadays
women's rights extend to
inviting the escorts and
paying admission charges.)
She thirsted and asked the
escort to get her a gin
and tonic. Imagine him
when faced with a tab
saying a dollar and a quar-
ter.
Later, she thirsted again
and asked for a Coca-Cola.
This cost him 50 cents.
Visions of the basketball
or movie tickets he could
have bought with all that
money ran through his
mind all night. At break-
fast next morning, he ex-
ploded violently about
girls and the high cost of
drinking. I am certain that
his view will prevail in
the household of which he
will sometime he a not-
too-silent partner.

The Family Economics
Burcau Bulletin notes an-
other alarming factor in
present-day consumption
of spirits. A drink or two
will go farther and faster
today—especially on high-
ways, This, we are remind-
ed, is "the deadly differ-
ence." When pa and ma
were young, nature had
built-in speed governors.
Horses and streetcars
were safer for the journey
home. The macabre fig-
ures of highway accidents
during the holidays show
that.
Statistics for the prohl-
bition era were kept in the
minds of certain men about
town or drivers of trucks.
Nearly all these felonious
businessmen are in their
graves, the victims of hom-
icidal competition. But the
per capita consumption
must have been much,
much less than now. Some-
times one wishes that the
happy medium of light
wines and beer might have
been adopted.
