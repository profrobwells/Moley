RAYMOND MOLEY:
Louisiana Election
Loaded With Drama

Not since the days of wife, and a bizarre motor
the incorrigible Huey cade through several
Long, which ended with
the "hayride" mired in
corruption, has there
been such a campaign as
one which ends with a
runoff primary for gov-
ernor of Louisiana today.
The contestants are De
Lesseps S. (Chep) Morri-
son, now serving his
fourth term as mayor of
New Orleans, and former
Gov. James Davis, noted
for his hillbilly music and
central figure in two earli-
er campaigns for chief ex-
ecutive of the state.

A month ago, in the first
primary, Morrison led a
field of five contenders
with a plurality of 65,000
votes over Davis.
This will be the latest
installment of an exciting
saga involving a compli-
cated story plot. In 1956
Morrison lost to Earl
Long, but following the
notorious activities of
Brother Earl, he decided
to make another try.
Some New Orleans citi-
zens, anxious to rid the
state of the unsavory
smog occasioned by Earl
Long's antics, decided to
get behind Davis. Morri-
son, they believed, could
not beat the Long ma-
chine and the elements al-
lied with it, especially in
North Louisiana. Morrison
is a Catholic and is regard-
ed in the remote parishes
(counties) as a city slicker.
Noting large amounts of
cash moving into Long's
hands, Treasury and rev-
enue agents had taken an
active interest in the gov-
ernor's financial affairs.
Hints of bribery moved
Long to declare that he
would seek the governor-
ship again, although he
was by law ineligible to
succeed himself.

The Legislature refused
to change the law on suc-
cession, despite noisy at-
tacks by Long upon friend
and foe, the press, busi-
ness, and people general-
ly. Long's conduct reached
a plateau of repulsiveness
in the firing of state of-
ficials, separation from his
Vindictive, crude, vul-
gar, Long lost most of his
remaining friends and
even killed the slim
chances of his candidate,
former Gov. James A. Noe,
Long was running for lieu-
tenant governor on Noe's
ticket. A deal whereby
Noe would resign in favor
of Long was suspected.

Two more candidates en-
tered the race, Comptroller
Bill Dodd, who was for-
merly Long's legislative
whip, and State Sen. Wil-
lie Rainach.
The Noe-Long drive
slowed to a walk. Rainach
brought out the segrega-
tion issue in a flamboyant
form, intending to damage
Morrison, who has avoided
racial trouble in New Or-
leans by rational approach-
es to the racial issue.
In the primary on Dec.
5 a heavy state vote was
cast, showing a strong
North vs. South Louisiana
division.
After the survival of
Morrison and Davis, Noe
and Dodd supported Mor-
rison in the runoff cam-
paign. It is alleged that
Davis has brought in the
race issue by saying that
Morrison won with the
support of "minority
groups" or "a minority
group." There is dispute
about whether the singu-
lar or plural was used in
the description.

Rainach, however, sup-
porting Davis, bedecked
his New Orleans headquar-
ters with huge signs:
"Davis - Aycock and U.S.
White" and "Morrison-
Hoffa and NAACP, Black."
This, plus the whipping up
of the religious issue, like
a self-inflicted wound is
painful and is likely to
leave grievous scars.
Morrison's associates are
working day and night to
pick up enough votes in a
heavy South Louisiana
and northern urban turn-
out to overcome what Da-
vis may gain in the segre-
gation parishes of North
Louisiana. There are rea-
sonable grounds for their
cautious optimism.
