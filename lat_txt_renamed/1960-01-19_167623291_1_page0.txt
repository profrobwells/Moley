British Deserve U.S. Sympathy
Over Their Dependency Troubles
Prime Minister Macmil-
lan has started the new
year with a tour of the
troubled tribes of Africa,
no doubt attempting to
find out which is, and
which is not, a real British
dependency. For so many
and so varied are the peo-
ples who imagine they are
under the benign protec-
tion of the queen that her
majesty's government can
hardly know whom they
really are governing.
There was, as we
learned in the nursery, an
old woman who lived in
a shoe, before the days of
planned parenthood. Her
distress with surplus off-
spring excited our child-
ish sympathy.

Perhaps we now should
extend our mature sympa-
thy to a young queen who
is mothering more people
in more places than she
can possibly know. I am
not referring to her im-
mediate and prospective
offspring, a subject which
is almost as exciting to
the British public as the
woman doctor who walked
from Birmingham to Lon-
don with her pet tortoise
for company and a toast-
ing fork for protection.
In the 40-odd territories
which are nominal British
dependencies, about all
that the people thereof un-
derstand is that they have
a queen. The British gov-
ernment, which is, like our
own, an unwieldy con-
traption, is not understood
by the vast majority. It
is very likely that when
the son of some African
tribesman, educated at
Oxford or Cambridge, suc-
ceeds in setting up an in-

dependent government on
the spot, the natives will
not understand that either.
These territories are in-
habited by an indetermi-
nate number and variety
of races and religions, with
infinitely varied traditions
and customs. Their local
governments, when they
have such, vary from
primitive tribalism to the
simulacrum of parliamen-
tary democracy. Their
value to the British home-
land varies from a sudden
burden to a good source of
revenue.
Some were acquired by
deliberate action of the
British government, some
by pure accident or by ac-
tion of the League of Na-
tions or the United Na-
tions. Others were acquired
in the most extraordinary
ways. Of these latter, the
London Times recently re-
minded its readers that
during the scramble for
Africa the British govern-
ment was anxious to avoid
"out-and-out annexation or
occupation."
*
It was content to let na-
ture, trading companies,
or individual adventurers
hold sway. And so "adven-
turous men" journeyed
over the continent, mak-
ing treaties where they
could. "In return for the
right to trade, or to carry
out missionary work, the
indigenous chief was of-
fered the protection of the
great queen."
According to the Times,
"There are many varia-
tions of these treaties.
Some were meaningless
scraps of paper signed by
Africans masquerading as
chiefs, or (real chiefs) who
did not know what they
were doing," in exchange
for a bottle or two of gin.
Hence the expression "gin-
bottle treaties."
But meanwhile a good
many young natives were
hospitably educated at
British universities, where
they learned a good mas-
tery of English along with
ideas about self-govern-
ment, Marxism, the evils
of colonialism, and the wily
ways of politics. On their
return to their native hab-
itat they have proceeded
to take large bites at the
nation that educated them.
"Colonialism" became a
dirty word. And dire
threats of bloody revolu-
tion have filled the tropi-
cal atmosphere.
*
Americans are all too
ready to take a lofty, con-
descending air toward
British colonialism, for-
getting the North Ameri-
can Indians- still being
slaughtered on TV --
the Mexicans, and the
Spanish. We should under-
stand that a great deal of
benefit has accrued to colo-
nial peoples because of
British imperialism.
Except for the lessons
in constitutional govern-
ment learned over the cen-
turies by the British, no
one anywhere, including
the United States, would
know anything about gov-
erning without an auto-
crat. This note of sympa-
thy for British enterprise
over the world expressed
by Vice President Nixon
in England last year won
him many friends there.
For the British are des-
perately trying to get out
of the business of ruling
other people and to get on
with trade in a free world.
