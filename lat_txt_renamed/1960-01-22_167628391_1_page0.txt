New York's Democratic Machine
Is in Graft, Trouble Once More
Hulan E. Jack, Harlem
leader and president of
the Borough of Manhattan,
entangled himself in
a mess of lies and double
talk and thus brought
about his indictment for
violation of the law. He
has been indicted by a
New York grand jury and
his future is squarely in
the uneasy lap of Gov.
Rockefeller and of the
trial court.
*
This suggests two observations. First, that the
Democratic machine, for
which Tammany is the
common name, has about
run its allotted span of
rule, and loose morals and
easy ways have, as always,
appeared after several
years of control over the
government of the city.
Second, that profuse expenditures of federal
money are just as much a
field for corruption as was
the old flow of private
money from contractors,
seekers of franchises and
bootleggers. The essential
pattern is the same. The
quick buck begets the
slick operator.
Tammany Hall, along
with the political power
which it has always maintained in the Democratic
Party in New York City, is
only a few weeks younger
than the government of
the United States. It was
founded on May 12, 1789.
Without pursuing its cycle of rule, corruption and
periodic downfalls in its
first century of life, we find
that since it began its second century in 1889 it has
invited and suffered disaster four times.
A reform mayor, William L. Strong, was elected
in 1894, but Tammany
came back with Robert A.
Van Wyck in 1897. In 1901
another reformer, Seth
Low, was elected but lasted
only two years. Tammany came back with the
son and namesake of Gen.
George B. McClellan as
mayor.
Again, in 1914, New
York turned to reform with
John Purroy Mitchel. He
lasted four years, and
Tammany with Brooklyn-
ite John Hylan was elected
in 1918. Things went
on until Fiorello La Guardia was elected in 1933. He
served 12 years.
The present span of
years of Democratic control in New York City,
which began with the election of William O'Dwyer,
has reached 14 years. It
will have reached 16 years
when the term of Mayor
Robert Wagner expires.
This will be the longest
stretch enjoyed by the
Democratic machine - of
which Manhattan's Tammany is now a junior partner-in 70 years.
*
But the recurrent symptoms are developing fast.
Mayor Wagner is stirring
uneasily and somewhat
wistfully, looking toward
the possibility of getting
out by way of a Vice Presidential nomination.
That is likely to be a
vain hope. In the past year
several bad embarrassments have been revealed.
The major ones have been
concerned with housing
under the Title I federal
legislation. Now the Tammany president of the
Borough of Manhattan, Hulan Jack, has been indicted for allegedly accepting a gratuity from a man,
Sidney J. Ungar, who has
been interested in slum-clearance projects.
It seems, according to
the district attorney, that
Jack, who is a big shot in
Harlem politics, had his
apartment remodeled at
the expense of Ungar.
After the newspapers
gave the transaction some
airing, Jack, Ungar and
the man who did the work
formulated a plan to have
it seem that Mrs. Jack
paid for the work. This exploded and then the story
was that there was a loan
from Ungar. Then came
the indictment.
*
Responsibility for action
concerning the removal of
Jack from his elective office rests with Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller. This is a
tough problem for the governor, since there has already been a hue and cry
in Harlem to the effect
that Jack is being persecuted because of his color.
The contention is that
there are lots of miscreants
of another color and they,
too, should be investigated. That may lead to
more trouble for the
Wagner regime.
And so the cycle runs
as always. The graft differs in kind, but morally
there is identity. Big money freely dispensed in contracts, or prostitution, or
bootleg liquor, or the numbers racket, or housing,
still attracts rapacious
people. New York gets bigger and richer but Tammany never learns from
the past.
