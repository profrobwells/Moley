The Congressional Record: Three
Subscribers for Each Legislator
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Over the tinkle of silverware and china and
the garbled drone of table
talk and whispered confidences, there is the unmistakable sound of tearing paper.
Across the District of
Columbia every morning
this season 200 or more
individuals linger over
coffee cups, tearing up
newspapers. Gobs of printed
stuff are excised and
laid aside.
Then with pockets
stuffed with these odd-
ments, our sovereign representatives find their
way to the Capitol to perform their solemn duties:
to spend $80 billion of
our tax money, to defend
us from our enemies
abroad, to protect hundreds of billions of our
savings from destruction,
to aid the free world, and
to "secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and
our posterity."
When the gavels sound
in the Senate chamber
and the House, there is a
clamor for recognition.
Regardless of the missile
gap, regardless of other
gaps in the national fabric, there emerges from
statesmen's pockets the
produce of the breakfast
table.
This will be delivered
as time glides by and then
published at considerable
expense by the Government Printing Office in
that fearsome receptacle
of trivia, the Congressional
Record.
Newspaper editors have
come to shudder at the
sight of this editorial monstrosity. One day's proceedings and debates with
appendix may run to as
many as 250 or 300 three-
column, tightly packaged
pages — a sure threat to
eyesight and good humor
if read conscientiously.
A typical Congressional
Record is that of Jan. 19.
Let us disregard the
House proceedings and
the appendix and turn to
the Senate's contribution
for the day — 78 pages.
Here we find editorials,
columns, and articles
plucked that very morning from a newspaper every one of the senators
probably received.
These items are reprinted
in entirety. One appears not once but three
times — occupying Pages
631, 649 and 662 — inserted by Sens. Johnson, Gore
and Clark respectively.
Supreme Court decisions, which are tediously
lengthy and are available
to every senator in his office, consume several
pages. And along comes
Wayne Morse, senator
from Oregon, a spring of
minutiae that never dries
up, a pleader of special interests who has taken up
more time in his day than
any other senator.
While matters of the utmost moment hang fire,
Sen. Morse inserts the following: Discussion of bru-
cellosis in cows and its
eradication; six letters or
editorials having to do
with the difficulties caused
by the importation of lamb
and mutton, and two large,
impressive tables of figures, reproduced twice,
showing monthly U.S.
lamb and mutton imports
by country of origin, 1958-
59; an editorial on agriculture's need of bargaining
power, and finally, an address that takes up three
pages entitled "Faith and
Science."
To date, both houses
have filled well over 1,000
pages. There has been one
piece of legislation passed
by the Senate at this writing.
Last year's Record cost
$1.6 million to print. Legislators are entitled to
give out a certain number
of subscriptions. Sen. Neuberger of Oregon, another
fountain of words, has said
that there are many people who would like to have
the Record free of charge.
"Alas," he despaired,
"few of those unrequited
souls seem to want the
Record badly enough to
pay $1.50 monthly for the
privilege; there is only a
handful of paid subscribers in the entire nation—
about 1,500." In other
words, three subscribers
for every legislator.
But the most discouraging aspect of the Record is
that the editor's nightmare is like a Hollywood set—
an imposing facade with
precious little substance
behind it. A cursory inspection shows that for a
good many of our elected
representatives the Record is a convenient front.
It further reveals what
is substituted for the hard
labor of constructive parliamentary debate, deliberation, and progress. Of
course, to get the latter
would require long hours
of work away from the
Senate and House floors.
This cannot be done over
the morning orange juice.
