RAYMOND MOLEY:
Passing the Buck
on Aid to Schools
The first bit of wisdom
a novice learns in Wash-
ington is the ancient art of
legislative buck-passing.
The Senate or the House
will pass a bill known to
be doomed in the other
house. Or both houses will
pass a bill to put the Pres-
ident "on the spot" and
which, after a veto, can-
not be passed.
The legislators thus
serve their political inter-
ests. They do not vote
their convictions, and they
betray their trust to the
people who elected them.
One of the worst exam-
ples of this in recent years
was the Senate's passing
of a bill for aid to school
construction and teach-
ers' salaries. Everyone in
the Senate knew that the
House would not accept
such a bill and that, if it
did, a Presidential veto
was certain.
★
In fact, a House commit-
tee has already prepared
a bill for submission which
greatly reduces the Sen-
ate figure for school con-
struction, House leaders
are unalterably opposed to
the Senate plan to supple-
ment teachers' salaries.
Fifty-four senators par-
ticipated in this hypocrisy,
and 35 voted their convic-
tions.
Both the school con-
struction and the teachers'
salary aspects of the bill
can be proved to be wholly
unnecessary. But since it
will be a long time before
the issue is resolved in the
House and, if anything is
passed, a long time before
the President would act, I
shall refer here only to a
few of the valid argu-
ments against generalized
federal aid for school con-
struction.
Any ordinary mortal
reading the debates on
"classroom shortages" in
connection with the bill
passed by the Senate will
end in a welter of confu-
sion.
★
Ever since President
Truman called for a
"school facilities survey"
in 1951 this numbers game
has been going on with the
most fantastic variations.
Commissioner of Educa-
tion Brownell said in Oc-
tober, 1954, that the "short-
age" was 370,000 class-
rooms. Sen. Lister Hill
upped this three months
later to 600,000. President
Eisenhower in February
said "over 300,000." Then,
after the utter unreliability
of the "survey" was dem-
onstrated, the embarrassed
administration decided on
its own survey and came
up with lower figures.
★
The annual reports of
"shortages" from the
states show how unreliable
they are. Alabama, Sen.
Hill's state, in 1954 re-
ported 19,750 rooms in use.
In 1956 it reported only
13,240 available. Its report
in 1959 showed 22,000 in
use and a great reduction
of the shortage.
Projections of future
needs have proved equal-
ly absurd in the light of
years. In 1955 the secre-
tary of the California
Teachers' Assn. testified
before a House committee
that California would need
"something over a billion
dollars" in school building
by 1960 and that the state
could not afford that much.
But the records show
that between 1955 and
1960 the state has spent
$2.1 billion on public
school construction. This
does not take into account
the sums spent on private
and parochial schools.
Upon this sort of guess-
work the Senate has made
the great gesture of an in-
tent to spend $1.8 billion
in two years. Such irre-
sponsible voting of tax-
payers' money deserves
stronger words of con-
demnation than any fami-
ly newspaper would print.
★
One of the reasons why
certain usually sound Re-
publican senators voted
for the monstrous bill
and why Republican lead-
ers in the House feel that
some bill for school con-
struction must be passed is
that statements by Secre-
tary Flemming and re-
ports from his U.S. Office
of Education have indicat-
ed a difference between
those reports and the
President's new proposal.
They have been embar-
rassed on the floor by cita-
tions of these differences
by the proponents of
school aid. It would seem
to be time for the Presi-
dent to get some of his of-
ficial family into a White
House classroom and
establish some discipline.
