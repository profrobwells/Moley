Popularity-Seeking Politicians
Force Business to Collect Taxes
A friend, William Feath-
er of Cleveland, who has
long since served Amer-
ican business as a printer
and author of company
house organs, makes an in-
teresting and arresting
suggestion of a reason
why, in political affairs
and otherwise, the corpo-
rations are not so pop-
ular as they should be.
It is true that millions
of Americans are suffi-
ciently well disposed to-
ward American businesses
to invest their hundred
billions of savings and
maintenance money in
stock and products.
But the habit of politi-
cians of lambasting busi-
ness, especially big busi-
ness, is still found an easy
means of getting votes.
Feather believes that
business has lost popular-
ity because government
has made it a tax collec-
tor.

"Business collects the
employee's income tax,
the Social Security pay-
ment and the gasoline, to-
bacco, liquor, entertain-
ment, sales and all other
excise taxes. On top of
this, business collects its
own profits tax by a neces-
sary levy on consumers.
What it all adds up to is
that business takes and
Congress gives."
A great deal can be said
for this suggestion. Since
these taxes have been col-

lected for some years
through businesses and all
were not levied at the
same time, it might be dif-
ficult to determine exactly
whether the politicians
who made the laws planned
it that way to play Santa
Claus with money col-
lected by business.
Perhaps it was not de-
liberate. But the political
mind has been conditioned
over the centuries to arts
of exacting revenue in the
most painless way possible
and thus retaining all pos-
sible goodwill for itself.

Many of the taxes men-
tioned were levied back in
the 1930s and 1940s when
some very crafty people
were at work planting em-
barrassments in the path
of business while they
were winning elections by
blasting opponents as
friends of business.
The delegation of tax-
ing power is very old. Un-
der ancient regimes gov-
ernors were supposed to
exact taxes in the areas
for which they were re-
sponsible and made a lot
for themselves in the proc-
ess. More modern nations,
like France, have farmed
out taxes to grimy char-
acters with sticky hands.
Present - day business,
however, gets no percent-
age for itself. In fact, it
must pay for and worry
about the vast bookkeep-
ing essential to the col-
lections. The cost of that,
of course, is a business ex-
pense which is deductible
but for which, in the long
run, other taxpayers must
compensate.
Some businesses are
quite properly giving con-
sumers notice of what is
going on by listing the
taxes separately from the
price of the goods. Com-
panies tell employees
what has been deducted
from their take-home pay
and what the deductions
are for. But unfortunately
consumers and employees
generally consider only
what they pay for what
they buy and what they
get for their work.
The constitutionality of
this sort of delegation of
the taxing power has been
challenged without suc-
cess. But judges too often
find constitutional grounds
for the tricks of the polit-
ical regimes which have
invested them with their
robes of office.

Hidden taxes of any
kind are wrong, and the
government which con-
trives them may well be
an instrument of tyranny.
Adam Smith's maxim that
a tax should be plainly
known to the taxpayer and
should be collected by the
most direct means possible
was published in the year
our Declaration of Inde-
pendence was signed and
is almost as important.
