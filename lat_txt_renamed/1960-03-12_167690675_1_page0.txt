RAYMOND MOLEY:
Weird Bookkeeping
by the Government
Two weeks ago I com-
mented on the Bureau of
• Reclamation's project at
Collbran, Colo., and the
discovery that the costs of
power would preclude re-
payment to the govern-
ment for an astronomical
period of years, if, in fact,
the project could ever be
justified.
Another aspect of weird
government bookkeeping
has appeared in connection
with what is called the
Curecanti Storage Unit in
the same area. In the cor-
respondence between the
Bureau of the Budget and
the secretary of the inte-
rior concerning this proj-
ect, an old, familiar device
is urged by the latter to
justify what the Budget
Bureau has clearly labeled
an uneconomical project.
*
That device is the "bene-
fit-cost ratio," the nature
of which should be made
known to taxpayers every-
where. For it will show
the waste of some of their
money is covered up by
bureaucratic bookkeeping
tricks.
The law on the books
concerning the justifica-
tion of reclamation proj-
ects is that of 1902. This
required an assurance that
the costs would be paid
back in dollars within a
specified time. When that
assurance was apparent,
the project was said to
have "financial feasibility."
However, in the 1930s,
an era of a new and
strange calculation of eco-
nomic values, there ap-
peared what has come to
be known as "economic
feasibility." It may seem
to the average citizen, ac-
customed to paying his
bills with or without inter-
est according to a dollar
measurement, that there is
no difference between "fi-
nancial" and "economic."
But that is not true in gov-
ernment calculations.

For if you should buy a
refrigerator to keep the
baby's milk cool and whole-
some, you could, under the
Interior Department's
method of bookkeeping,
say to the dealer that you
would not need to pay the
dealer the number of dol-
lars represented by the
price of the refrigerator.
You would show him a
"benefit-cost ratio." This
would tell him that, since
the baby was kept health-
ful by the cool milk, you
would not need to take
him to the city clinic and
thus the dealer would not
need to pay so much in
taxes to maintain the
clinic.
Under the "benefit-cost"
plan, the Bureau of Recla-
mation sets up on one side
the dollars that the dam,
or storage lake, or irriga-
tion project would cost
and on the other side all
sorts of compensating
items as a "benefit."
★
These items can be the
income taxes paid by the
farmers and others who
benefit by the project or
the taxes paid by the
manufacturer, possibly
hundreds of miles away,
who makes a profit by the
sale of the materials to the
government.
In one case, where a
large lake above a dam
was involved, there was
included in the economic
"benefits" the amount that
might be spent by tourists
who would come to look at
the lake, including the
meals they would consume
and the gasoline they
would use.
This shift from "finan-
cial" to "economic" feasi-
bility has been condemned
by responsible bodies, in-
cluding the Engineers
Joint Council which repre-
sents the major engineer-
ing societies in the United
States. But its use con-
tinues.
★
Last year the Bureau
of the Budget told the sec-
retary of the interior that
the Curecanti project could
not even be "economical-
ly" justified. But the act-
ing secretary of the inte-
rior held that the "bene-
fits" would exceed the
costs.
The Budget Bureau
contended that such cal-
culations of "benefits"
over a period of 100 years
must be highly specula-
tive since no one could
know what economic life
would be like in such a re-
mote period beyond the
present generation.
The Budget Bureau
might have added that if
this sort of bookkeeping
continues, we might won-
der whether we will have
any economic life at all.
