The AFL-CIO in its
comprehensive economic
and political ideology has
embraced many plans for
this country's future. Now
it would cradle to its am-
ple bosom the vastly com-
plex matter of trade in
the free world. It would
accomplish this by eco-
nomic persuasion or, to be
more accurate, economic
coercion.
However, one of the
tenets of the AFL-CIO has
been free trade, and this
was unobjectionable to
most of its affiliated
unions so long as the
United States enjoyed an
easy market. This lasted
for a good many years fol-
lowing World War II.
But as vigorous, re-
sourceful peoples, aided
by huge recovery pro-
grams from the United
States, replaced their
smashed and worn produc-
tion facilities with more
and better equipment and
new assembly lines, in
many cases superior to
those in the United
States, this country's posi-
tion in the world's mar-
kets faced imminent and
very rough competition.
U.S. producers ran hard
into the challenge of the
industrial plant capacity
of Europe and Japan.
Some found that their la-
bor costs made it impos-
sible to compete abroad or
even against imports in
this country. Some folded,
cut back, turned to other
lines, or established sub-
sidiaries abroad.
Many local unions have
been alarmed by these de-
velopments and have
urged greater protection

through tariffs and quotas.
Others have shown grow-
ing concern over the ris-
ing tide of goods flowing
from foreign assembly
lines and shops.
Today, the AFL-CIO
clings to free trade in its
program for mankind but
with certain very interest-
ing qualifications. The
most astonishing is its
stand for the imposition of
"fair labor standards in
international trade." The
AFL-CIO economic policy
committee has spelled out
how this should be done:
"There should be an ob-
ligation upon all countries
to see to it that wages
and working conditions in
exporting industries fully
reflect the productivity
and the degree of techno-
logical advance of such in-
dustries and of the nation-
al economy."
Following a rambling
discussion in which extra-
neous statistics are used
to prove that the "United
States is not out-priced,"
the committee maintains
that to compete in the
world market, "American
companies are going to
have to buckle down to a
real selling job if they are
to retain the markets they
built up in the years
when the United States
had little competition in
the world market."
Recently the Connecti-
cut State Labor Council,
AFL-CIO, at its conven-
tion underlined the com-
mittee's views. Connecti-
cut, a resolution points
out, has been hard hit by
imports of textiles, hats,
apparel, plateware, type-
writers, sewing machines,
brass fabricating and rub-
ber footwear.
"Substandard wage lev-
els or working conditions
are clear evidence of the
existence of unfair compe-
tition in internation-
al trade and should be
eliminated as rapidly as
possible," says the resolu-
tion.
"We also urge that
where it is clearly demon-
strated that jobs are be-
ing lost by American
workers . . . consideration
be given to the placing of
adequate protective tariffs
and quotas on typewriters
and other products that
are affected by foreign im-
ports which now enter
this country free and clear
of any import duties."
Any exhorting by the
United States of other
countries to see to it that
they change their econom-
ic ways would be unfortu-
nate and damaging to our
position. The imposition of
domestic policies by treaty
is against what we have
stood for in the past, and if
we stand for nothing else
we stand for freedom and
self-determination by our
friends throughout the
world.
This does not mean that
voluntarily many coun-
tries, including the Unit-
ed States, might not do
well to reassess their
economies to determine
what they can produce
most efficiently. The free
world is undergoing dy-
namic change, and its
economies are subject to
this condition.
