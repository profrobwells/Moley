Harvard Academicians Are Caught
on the Horns of 'Partisanship'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the January issue of
the Harvard Alumni Bul-
letin there are two letters
which should enliven the
serious atmosphere in a
year of electioneering.
One is signed by Profs.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and
John K. Galbraith, stal-
wart partisans of the lib-
eral wing of the Demo-
cratic Party.
In a letter addressed to
the president and fellows
of Harvard College, and
not at all in the spirit of
levity, the charge is made
that Harvard has been
giving honorary degrees
to more Republicans than
Democrats. It demands
equal honors for deserving
Democrats.
*
Since Prof. Schlesinger
is looking after what can-
didate Kennedy has to say
these days and Prof. Gal-
braith is providing the
Democratic Party with its
economic philosophy, one
might suppose that these
gentlemen would be pret-
ty well occupied with seri-
ous affairs. But to them
"share the honors" is a
noble cause.
This complaint is not
new. Back in the 1920s
in, I believe, the New Re-
public, there was an article
complaining that radicals
were getting short-
changed by the universi-
ties in the matter of LL
Ds. It cited Prof. Felix
Frankfurter as one with-
out enough letters after his
name to fit his importance.
That, however, has been
rectified, by no less than
five institutions, including
Oxford and Harvard.
So time healeth all hon-
orable wounds. If Profs.
Schlesinger and Galbraith
will only wait long enough
and their Democratic
Party efforts succeed,
there will be no remaining
Republicans to honor. And
then, unless Democrats are
decorated, the academic
procession on Commence-
ment Day will lose all its
color.
*
It seems, however, de-
spite these Democratic
complaints, that Harvard
still harbors bits of humor.
The Bulletin includes a let-
ter from Profs. William Y.
Elliott and W. Barton
Leach which was inspired
by the complaint of their
colleagues. It proposes a
way out for the bewildered
university authorities.
"One sure way," they
suggest, "of avoiding such
controversy would be to
make posthumous awards
to persons unconnected
with the American politi-
cal scene."
Prof. Elliott, who is not
only a notable professor of
history and government
but a student of the Eliza-
bethan drama, incorpo-
rates the suggestion that a
degree be conferred upon
Edward de Vere, seventh
Earl of Oxford, whom
Prof. Elliott believes to be
"in the main" the author
of the plays attributed to
one William Shakespeare.
Surely the letter makes
clear that honors have
been withheld some cen-
turies too long from this
genius.
But here Profs. Elliott
and Leach run into the
problem of partisanship.
For Oxford was of the
House of Lancaster, and
political power was equal-
ly shared in the days be-
fore the Tudors by the
House of York. Scholar-
ship again comes to the
rescue.
As the letter points out,
a grievous posthumous in-
jury has been visited up-
on Richard III of the
House of York. In a fine
book profusely document-
ed, an American author,
Paul Murray Kendall, has
proved, at least to me,
that Richard was a pretty
decent king and that after
his death at Bosworth
Field malicious Tudor his-
torians smothered his
memory with all sorts of
weird inventions.
*
The line suggested by
the Elliott-Leach letter
might be pursued further.
I suggest that the great-
est and most misunder-
stood and blackened politi-
cal writer of his age, Nic-
colo Machiavelli, be suit-
ably honored.
But here again we have
partisanship, for the later
Medici were not fond of
him. Therefore, why not
balance the matter by con-
ferring a doctorate in fine
arts upon their forebear
Lorenzo (the Magnificent)
de Medici?
The list of the neglected
could be extended, but
this is enough to extricate
the president and fellows
of Harvard from the
charge of Republicanism.
