Mr. Corcoran Demonstrates That
the Ways of Reform Are Devious

While nothing illegal or
even improper has yet
been established in the in-
cidents revealed concern-
ing the contacts which
Thomas G. Corcoran,
prominent Washington
lawyer, made with the
chairman and members of
the Federal Power Com-
mission, the matter brings
out certain interesting if
not amusing reflections on
the ways of reform.

Corcoran, as a lawyer
representing various busi-
ness interests, one of
which in this instance had
a vital case before an ad-
ministrative agency, has
come a long way from
Tommy the Cork who
served as a sort of minstrel
in the White House court
during the first and sec-
ond terms of the Roosevelt
administrations. In those
days he bemused a heavily
burdened President with
gay tunes on his accordion.
He also was busily occu-
pied in drafting legislation
and in promoting the cause
of the Roosevelt reforms
among members of Con-
gress.

His eminence in the
Chief Executive's circle
was of short duration, be-
cause the ground around
that resplendent court was
very slippery indeed. Not

BY RAYMOND MOLEY
even in the two years when
he was so frequently men-
tioned in the public press
was his eminence so great
as fanciful writers sup-
posed or even as he him-
self conceived it to be. The
Hopkins star was ascend-
ant at that time and soon
became a major luminary
in the constellation.

In a recent book, "The
Invisible Presidency,"
which I noted in this col-
umn some weeks back,
Corcoran is listed among
such "invisible" powers as
Martin Van Buren and
Sherman Adams.

The professor who wrote
the book seemed intrigued
by Corcoran, and his ac-
count is romantic and at
times mistaken in its de-
lineation of the Corcoran
power. Corcoran was cer-
tainly not "invisible" in
those days, and the cur-
rent incident has certain-
ly lent him high visibility
now.

The cream of the jest in
the present instance is
that, in those far-off re-
formist days. Corcoran
was an evangelistic expo-
nent of restrictive, not to
say punitive, legislation
against business. And one
of the agencies which the
bill-drafting genius of Cor-
coran — together with
that of his fellow reform-

er, Ben Cohen — equipped
with great powers of busi-
ness was this same Fed-
eral Power Commission.

There are those who
will remember the violent
fight in Congress in the
summer of 1935 over the
holding company bill. Cor-
coran was in the midst of
that, bent on breaking up
the "power trust."

Perhaps there is logic in
employing an individual
who helped make the laws
to help business to live
with the laws. In any
event, such transforma-
tion of reformers, from
champions of the public
interest, to advocates of
private interests, is one of
the most prevalent mani-
festations of the effect of
long exposure to the ex-
citing and heated atmos-
phere of the nation's capi-
tal.

After all, it is important
for a successful lawyer to
know his way around and
to be familiar with the
laws.

It is also interesting to
note that Corcoran's zeal
for politics is not abated,
because he is reported to
be "brain trusting" for the
Presidential boom of Sen.
Lyndon Johnson.

Indeed, time has its way
with reform and reform-
ers.
