Whatever providence
guards us against our fol-
lies may be thanked that
this tawdry carnival in
Wisconsin is finished and
that we shall have a few
days or weeks to think.
Almost every conclusion
we shall reach must lead
to the profoundly depress-
ing wonder whether the
free political institutions
we outwardly revere have
been worth all the blood
and toil lavished on them
by our illustrious ances-
tors.
No doubt, the fine, en-
lightened, highly educated
people of Wisconsin share
that wonder. As they are
able once more to look
over the beautiful surface
of Lake Michigan or the
incomparable inland lakes,
as green is appearing on
the rolling hills in the
west, their wonder must
be intensified by resent-
ment at the affront that
these candidates have giv-
en their intelligence.
"What kind of people
did they think we are? Did
we, who have done so
much and spent so much
to educate ourselves and
to build better political
institutions, deserve that
kind of appeal?"
A fundamental principle
in practical politics is that
when there is no party or
ideological choice to move
people, they will turn to
other loyalties and alle-
giances. I proved this by
very considerable research
and published articles in
studying nonpartisan elec-
tions in Ohio 37 years ago.
In this campaign, Ken-
nedy and Humphrey were
ideological twins. The vol-
ing records of both in the
ADA book are 13-0. Hence,
thousands of people turned
from their loyalty to their
religion. This meant that
there was a Roman Catho-
lic and a Protestant vote.
When that happens, the
most deplorable situation
rises. I once heard the
notable Rabbi Stephen
Wise tell his congrega-
tion, "When there is a pro-
Jewish vote, you invite an
anti-Jewish vote."
Another principle of pol-
itics is that the less there
is to say about real issues,
the more will be spent on
frivolous and diversionary
activities. Money flowed
like water—and coffee. In
his last desperate stand
Sen. Humphrey blurted
out to reporters that Ken-
nedy spent more for his
private plane than Hum-
phrey had to spend on his
whole campaign. No one
will ever know the amount
of expenditures, since the
legal requirements for offi-
cial reports are wholly
inadequate.
The appeals were to ev-
ery personal concern but
the brains. There were the
horribly corny songs, the
huge coffee parties, the
crass mobilization of union
members and the ocular
display produced by the
cafe society of Hollywood,
Chicago, New York and
Boston.
Another avenue was
available, which was ap-
parently not thought
worth an appeal to the
pride of the state, the high
road of principle. This has
been done successfully in
Wisconsin in the past.
In 1932 candidate Roose-
velt was returning east
after a long campaign trip
to the Far West. On the
morning before his arrival
at Milwaukee, he was sit-
ting in the lounge of his
private car dictating a
speech for Wisconsin. The
subjects elaborated as he
rambled on, were things
that all sorts of special in-
terests in the state had
suggested—the dairy in-
dustry, cheese, inland wa-
terways, conservation, the
St. Lawrence development,
and other mundane, local
matters.
Sitting with him were
Mrs. Roosevelt, Sens.
Byrnes of South Carolina
and Pittman of Nevada,
Secretary Marvin McIn-
tyre and this writer. There
was a silence while the
copy was being typed.
Then the candidate asked
those present to offer their
opinions. The verdict—
"terrible."
Pittman spoke up and
said in effect, "Why not
appeal to the state's pride
rather than its wants; its
great university, the influ-
ence of which has touched
everyone in the state; the
fine traditions of freedom,
political advances and the
state's contributions to
free institutions in the na-
tion?"
Roosevelt thought it
over a moment and then,
throwing his speech in the
wastebasket, said, "Go
ahead and write that kind
of speech." We did. It was
delivered. The vote five
weeks later was 707,000 to
347,000 in his favor.
The farmers and work-
ers were in vastly poorer
shape than now. They
had, and have now, pluck,
idealism and pride. But
these candidates of 1960
failed to realize it.
