Sen. Kennedy's ample
stable of speech writers
seems to be running short
of ideas and phrases. That
is not strange, since the
young man's output of ver-
bal ammunition must
spread over such a large
part of the republic.
As the West Virginia
show gets under way, he
is quoted as declaiming
that the Eisenhower ad-
ministration is "frozen in
the ice of its own indiffer-
ence."
These words are exactly
the same as those used by
President Roosevelt in his
speech in Philadelphia in
1936 accepting the nomi-
nation of his party for the
second time. The Roose-
velt sentence was, "Better
the occasional faults of a
government that lives in
a spirit of charity than the
constant omissions of a
government frozen in the
ice of its own indiffer-
ence."
Since I wrote not only
that sentence but the short
passage in which it ap-
peared, I recognized the
identity at once.
The purpose of the sen-
tence in the Roosevelt
speech and the ones which
accompanied it was to re-
veal that at that stage in
his career the President
was willing to admit that
he could possibly make a
mistake now and then.
This was good politics, be-
cause to admit something
short of perfection is an
endearing trait. It reminds
us all of our frailties.
But Sen. Kennedy can-
not afford to admit mis-
takes at this stage of
his perilous climb. He is
not so assured of success
as was President Roose-
velt at that historic mo-
ment. But one phrase,
thus lifted, seemed pretty.
It is no wonder that the
Kennedy pedants are
combing the Roosevelt rec-
ord, because there ap-
pears more and more an
effort to identify the sena-
tor with the late leader of
his party.
According to a good re-
porter on the scene in
West Virginia, President
Roosevelt is revered there
as is no other modern
statesman. His picture
hangs in many dwellings
in the rustic byways and
is no doubt still used to
cure kidney stones, rheu-
matism, and chilblains.
Most politicians there
have the Roosevelt like-
ness in their offices, as an
amulet to scare away Re-
publican spooks.
Sen. Kennedy has sent
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Jr. into the state to
awaken old memories.
Junior's likeness to his
father stops with the cata-
logue of physical charac-
teristics. But since the
Kennedy campaign seems
to rely on ocular demon-
strations rather than any-
thing else, Junior will
serve a purpose. He is a
strapping youth in any
company.
Moreover, since the
master strategist in the
Kennedy campaign seems
to be father Joseph Pat-
rick himself, it is to be ex-
pected that the pattern of
earlier success will be fol-
lowed in the present blue-
prints. For the politician
and the speculator are
the most superstitious of
our species. And father
Joseph Patrick is both.
According to his own ac-
count, when Gov. Roose-
velt first aspired to the
nomination, Mr. Kennedy
put $20,000, as the race
track phrase has it, "on
the nose" of the governor.
In the Roosevelt admin-
istration he did an effec-
tive job as first head of the
Securities Exchange Com-
mission. Then he was
chairman of the Maritime
Commission, and then he
was promoted to the Court
of St. James.
The father will be no
candidate for diplomatic
honors, but his old age
might be warmed at a fire-
side in the White House.
And who could ask for
more?
