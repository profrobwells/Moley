The flagellants in the
Middle Ages were curious
people who sought salva-
tion by whipping them-
selves. In the meeting of
the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, the
press invited eminent crit-
ics to lay a few lashes upon
their own bent shoulders.
One of the critics was
Robert Moses, who for
many years has held sev-
eral jobs dedicated to the
rebuilding of New York
City. Adlai Stevenson
came to inform the editors
of their sins and omissions.
Dr. Frank Stanton, presi-
dent of the Columbia
Broadcasting System, was
the third critic.
The Moses speech com-
plained about newspaper
attacks upon his adminis-
tration of certain housing
projects in his city. Ste-
venson pointed out how
the opposition party might
be aided by more gentle
treatment.
Stanton invited a com-
parison between the press
and the air waves. He also
took the occasion to pay
back certain scores made
against his media by the
press last year during the
exposures of rigged quiz
shows, payola and over-
emphasis on violence.
There had also been men-
tioned the excessive intru-
sion of commercials in en-
tertainment programs.
The editors took all the
criticism in good humor,
although in the case of
Stanton they might have
replied that if it had not
been for exposures by con-
gressional committees and
newspaper criticism the
networks might not have
put their minds on some
measures of self-reform.
But more important
than these cases of un-
usual abuses might have
been a consideration of the
respective values of news-
papers and radio-TV in
what might be called the
informing and education
of the public in public af-
fairs. Since an enlightened
public is essential to the
preservation of free insti-
tutions, all means of com-
munication bear a heavy
responsibility.
It is clear that despite
the vast labors and money
which radio-TV has spent
on disseminating news and
in presenting discussions
of public issues the basic
reliance of the public must
be upon newspapers.
Radio and, to a greater
degree, television are me-
dia whose primary func-
tion must be entertain-
ment. In that field they
have almost unlimited po-
tentials. In the daily news-
papers, the presentation of
news, plus interpretation
and opinion, is a primary
and traditional responsi-
bility.
In the presentation of
news, its interpretation
and editorial comment,
there is a time factor
which must keep the news-
papers at an advantage.
What one hears and sees
over the air waves is im-
parted momentarily and is
gone. Those who hear and
see are not the masters of
the time element. That
must be determined by the
nature of the medium.
A newspaper is in the
reader's hands. If he re-
quires considerable time
to comprehend an item, he
can take it. People vary in
their capacity to compre-
hend and think. He may
also choose the time of day
when he is best able to
read and reread if he
wishes. With the increas-
ing complexity of world
and national affairs, the
citizen to be well informed
must chew and digest the
news.
If the subject is contro-
versial, a newspaper can
state the facts in the news
and then interpret and
voice its opinion in its edi-
torials. Radio and televi-
sion can offer spot news,
often hours ahead of the
press. But I doubt whether
they can ever provide an
adequate exposition of in-
terpretation and opinion.
A time element is in-
volved.
Also, sponsors hesitate
to back programs of opin-
ion because they want to
sell their products to peo-
ple of all points of view.
In a panel show present-
ing opposing views or load-
ed questions, the verdict
goes to the glib and the
coiner of phrases.
Reading can never be
replaced by hearing and
seeing. In meeting the
need of democratic institu-
tions for a thoroughly in-
formed public, the air
waves can never match
the services of a free press.
