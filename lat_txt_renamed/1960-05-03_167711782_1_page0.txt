RAYMOND MOLEY:
Johnson's Skill May
Decide Convention
So far as I know, one
very important point has
been overlooked in all cur-
rent speculation about the
Democratic scramble for
the Presidential nomina-
tion. That point, often de-
cisive in a bitter conven-
tion battle, is floor man-
agement and strategy.
In that department
Sen. Lyndon Johnson,
generally rated as a can-
didate less likely to suc-
ceed, has a great advan-
tage. For none of the Dem-
ocratic contenders has
had the experience and
the proved success of
Johnson in parliamentary
battles.
*
Beginning with the
great decisive year 1896,
there have been 32 con-
ventions of major parties.
In 21 of these the nomina-
tion was either complete-
ly noncontested or largely
predetermined. But in 11
there was a real fight. In
some of those, an under-
dog came to the top.
That was true in the
Democratic conventions of
1896, 1912, 1920, and 1932.
It was that way in the
Republican conventions of
1920 and 1940. In the Re-
publican conventions of
1896, 1912, 1936, 1944, 1918,
and 1952 the man nominat-
ed had fairly stiff opposi-
tion, although he entered
with either an even chance
or a fair advantage.
But in at least five of the
11 contested nominations
the skill and strategy of
management won. Let us
take a few examples. The
myth exists that in 1920 a
few deep-throated profes-
sionals met in a "smoke-
filled room," and because
the election seemed to be
"in the bag" they picked
the most pliable of all pos-
sibilities, Warren G. Har-
ding.
*
That sort of thing makes
a good story for the movies
and novels. But a certain
inevitability and availabil-
ity pervade even such in-
iquitous conclaves. Two
of the leading candidates,
Sen. Hiram Johnson and
Gen. Leonard Wood, were
the claimed heirs of the
great Theodore Roosevelt.
Not only did they have
strength enough to create
a mutual deadlock, but
the wounds of 1912 were
not yet healed.
Someone had to be
found who would alienate
neither the old progres-
sives nor the Taft regulars.
Gov. Lowden would have
been a good choice, but
some of his money had
been misused in the pre-
convention campaign, and
there was danger of that
becoming an issue in the
election.
Harding had the nucleus
of a following with his
own state delegation and
a few others. His fellow
senators liked him. He
had no real enemies and
had no positive convic-
tions about the old Taft-
T.R. conflict. No one else
was in sight, and so the
leaders in the big states
decided to nominate him.
In 1932 the in-fighting
was terrific. Two ballots
had been taken, with Gov.
Roosevelt in a majority
but still short of the neces-
sary two-thirds. Roosevelt
managers knew that once
a front runner slips he is
doomed. There was a fren-
zied running around by
the Roosevelt floor man-
agers and political advis-
ers, who were real strate-
gists.
*
In another ballot there
was almost a certainty
that two or three Roose-
velt delegations would
bolt. Many people claim
credit for the master
stroke: give the Vice Pres-
idential nomination to
Speaker Garner and in re-
turn take the Texas and
California delegations. The
rest is history.
In 1860 on the first bal-
lot Lincoln was far behind
Gov. Seward of New York.
Then began some of the
fastest horse trading in
history. Cabinet posts were
pledged for delegates.
Cameron released the
Pennsylvania delegation.
Then Chase of Ohio add-
ed what was required.
Cameron became secretary
of war and Chase secretary
of the treasury. Seward
was made secretary of
state, although his delega-
tion never went for Lin-
coln until the nomination
was a certainty.
In 1952 Taft would
probably have been nomi-
nated except for the bad
judgment of his managers.
That is well known.
*
In 1960, if, as is prob-
able, Kennedy and John-
son lead with something
less than a majority, the
incredible capacity of
Johnson to trade, cajole or
threaten will come into
full play, just as it has
been revealed in many a
Senate vote since he has
been majority leader.
Perhaps he will fail to
win the prize himself but
it would be a safe wager
that no one will succeed
whom he opposes, and it
might well be that his
choice will prevail. Who
that might be is not
known.
But his opponents will
feel the impact of a mas-
ter's hand in the balloting.
