RAYMOND MOLEY:
GOP Soil Bank Plan
Won't Solve Problem
In a desperate effort to
appease the farm vote and
reduce surpluses, some Re-
publicans in and out of
the administration are con-
sidering a crash soil bank
program big enough to
wipe out the surplus in
certain commodities, to be
stopped in four years.
Vice President Nixon
has not announced his pro-
gram. On the other hand,
Democrats in Congress
have, as an alternative
program, the old Brannan
plan of 10 years ago. That
is bidding with a venge-
ance with all taxpayers'
money as stakes.

Two weeks ago, in Illi-
nois, I asked a real tub-
thumping farm politician
whether massive soil re-
tirement at government
expense could be stopped
after four years. He said
it could.
I was not impressed.
For my memory goes back
to the first, so-called do-
mestic allotment plan ad-
ministered by the AAA be-
ginning in 1933. The prin-
ciple, of subsidies in one
form or another to restrict
production has continued
for 27 years, and things
are worse now than ever
so far as government out-
lays are concerned.
The idea embodied in
the Republican plan and
set forth in a bill which
will probably get nowhere
is that if the government
rents more and more land,
it will be possible to eat
into the more productive
acres and production will
fall. The administration
bill calls for 60 million
acres as compared with
the 28 million now idled at
government expense.
Two economists at Iowa
State University have pub-
lished in Iowa Farm
Science the results of a
study of how much soil
bank is enough to bring
production in line with
demand.

One is Walter Butcher,
an employee of the U.S.
Department of Agricul-
ture, and the other is Earl
Heady, executive director
of the center for agricul-
tural studies at Iowa State.
They begin with an
analysis of feed grains.
They note that the average
annual excess of produc-
tion over consumption is
600,000 tons. To stop this
overproduction it would
be necessary to cut back
6% of production. That
would mean retiring 9.3
million acres in that crop.
In wheat, it would be
necessary to retire 11.3
million acres.
But considering that
about a third of the farm
land retired under the soil
bank is unproductive any-
how or is used to raise
nonsurplus crops, this fig-
ure for wheat land should
be put at 15 million, with
an additional 2 million to
care for the rising produc-
tivity of land due to mech-
anization and science.
By 1965 there would be
needed to be added to the
soil bank for these two
crops alone, 25 million
acres. But that does not
account for any reduction
in the present stored sur-
plus. If we want to get that
used up, it would be nec-
essary to reduce produc-
tion below annual con-
sumption. That would
mean more acres.
Meanwhile what would
happen? The money need-
ed would probably wipe
out any possible surplus
in the Treasury and run
the government into more
red ink.
Very important also
would be a further infla-
tion in land values. Be-
cause wherever govern-
ment grants a subsidy in
anything connected with
land, there is land inflation
with speculators reaping
the benefit.
Farm land "values" are
already 34% higher than
in 1954 and 70% higher
than in 1950. There is some
talk about a slackening in
this inflation, but the proof
is dubious. But when no
buyers appear to buy land
to keep it out of produc-
tion at government ex-
pense, there is bound to be
a crash — with resultant
distress far beyond any-
thing now proclaimed by
even the most ardent farm
politician.

Perhaps all this will end
up in the plan advocated
by Huey Long in 1933,
based, he said, upon the
story of Jacob in the Bible.
That solution would have
the government purchase
the surpluses until there
was enough for a year's
supply in any given crop.
Then put all the land de-
voted to that crop out of
use for a year and eat up
the surplus.
Farmers could go fish-
ing, or to Florida, or travel
abroad. Maybe that would
be less costly than pres-
ently proposed solutions.
