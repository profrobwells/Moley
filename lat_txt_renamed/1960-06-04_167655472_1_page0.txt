RAYMOND MOLEY:
Able Conservatives
Show Way in Texas
HOUSTON, Tex.â€”It has
mystified many that, while
Dallas has generally elect-
ed conservative Demo-
crats or Republicans to
the state Legislature and
Congress, Houston has so
often gone the other way.
Since 1956 the liberal
wing of the Democratic
Party has had a majority
in the Harris County com-
mittee; and since 1958 lib-
eral Democrats have rep-
resented the city in the
Legislature. Houston, in
fact, has been the center
of activity of the liberals,
who go by the name Dem-
ocrats of Texas, or DOT.
This has been due to the
apathy and indifference of
the business community to
its political responsibility;
*
After the disastrous
election of 1958, however,
an awakening took place.
The direction of this reviv-
al was to organize in the
precincts and get out the
vote of all those who pre-
ferred conservative gov-
ernment.
There were two phases
of this movement. Searcy
Bracewell, a former state
senator and well-known
lawyer, undertook to elect
a conservative Democratic
county committee, while
Walter Sterling, a busi-
nessman and the son of a
former Texas governor,
enlisted business and pro-
fessional workers for con-
servative candidates for
the eight seats in the state
Legislature.
An organization called
Freedom in Action, cre-
ated by Judge Ellwood
Fouts, materially assisted
in the conservative drive.
*
It should be noted that
all of this effort was with-
in the Democratic Party.
The top management of
many important business-
es encouraged employees
to get active in their pre-
cincts. Good candidates
were selected. And an or-
ganized effort was made
in all of the 266 precincts.
Legal steps were taken
to stop fraudulent voting,
which has generally been
a factor in primary elec-
tions.
Another factor which
had hitherto handicapped
conservative Democrats
was the multiplicity of
candidates on their side.
The liberals were careful
not to split their vote.
Hence, in all but two of
the races for the Legisla-
ture, only one conserva-
tive was entered.
*
On primary day, May 7,
a veritable revolution took
place. Large numbers of
conservatives appeared at
the polling places. In some
precincts three times as
many people voted as in
previous primaries. In the
heavily industrialized Pas-
adena district it had been
previously considered nor-
mal for only one of the 15
precincts to vote conserva-
tive. This time the con-
servatives won in 10.
The result was a heavy
majority of conservatives
on the Democratic County
Committee: One of the
eight candidates for the
legislative seats was un-
opposed but, in the re-
maining seven, three con-
servatives and two lib-
erals were chosen. For the
remaining two there will
be a run-off primary to-
day and there are high
hopes that conservatives
will win in those contests.
*
Texas has the very in-
teresting method of elect-
ing delegates to the coun-
ty conventions of the par-
ties at precinct "conven-
tions," held in the evening
of the primary in stores,
homes and on street cor-
ners. This year a large
turnout of conservatives
appeared. The conserva-
tives swept these, too.
As a result of this up-
set, the moving spirit of
DOT, Mrs. R. D. Randolph,
is expected to be ousted as
Democratic national com-
mitteewoman from the
state.
The result shows what
can be done when con-
servatives make a real ef-
fort under intelligent lead-
ership. Houston has set an
example for many other
large cities in the nation.
The potential vote is there.
But it needs leadership to
get it to the polls.
