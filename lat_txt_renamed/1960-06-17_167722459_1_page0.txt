Rockefeller Proposal Parallels
Program Urged by Democrats
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
line without knowing
much about the reasons
why.
Rockefeller was thus
permitted to establish his
erroneous, not to say
false, assumption that
Nixon has not made his
position clear on every
one of the fundamental
issues upon which his
campaign will be based.
On defense and foreign
affairs he stands firmly
with the President, with
the addition of his own
convictions about the
Communist position and
the necessity of facing it
realistically. He has taken
a position on every one of
the points raised by Rockefeller on the domestic
front.

Two and a half months
ago, as a reporter and
commentator, I addressed
a letter to Nixon saying
that it seemed to be a
good time to state his
position on domestic issues, and in reply he invited me to go over the
whole field in a personal
interview. I accepted and
delineated his stand in
three issues of Newsweek.
On the basis of that, let
us compare the 10 points
of Rockefeller with Nixon's position.
As I have indicated,
his position on foreign affairs and defense is that
of the President. On domestic issues the comparisons and contrasts are
these:
1—Basic in the entire
Rockefeller — Democratic
economic philosophy is
the need that, by planning and stimulating the
economy by public works
and welfare expenditures
by the federal government, the rate of growth
of the gross national product should be increased
to 5 or 6% from its present level of about 3%.
Nixon rejects this in toto.
He would, by tax revision and by protecting
the freedom of the economy, permit wider opportunity, confidence, and
competition to provide
natural growth.
2—Rockefeller subscribes to the Forand
principle, which would tie
health aid for the elderly to Social Security, with
increased Social Security
taxes. Nixon rejects this
and would provide aid to
those who need it on a
voluntary basis.
3—On school aid, Rockefeller would provide federal aid for construction,
with some money for
scholarships. Nixon would
pinpoint aid for construction only. Essentially,
there is no difference
here.
★
4—On labor, Nixon
would sustain the Taft-
Hartley and Landrum-
Griffin Acts and build
upon them. He opposes
compulsory arbitration.
Rockefeller is for
compulsory arbitration.
No conclusion can be
reached except that
Rockefeller would have
the Republican Party and
its candidate agree with
him or face defeat in
November. Yes, we will
support the party, he
says, but apparently with
great misgivings about
its success. That would
open the way for him in
1964. Neither Nixon nor
his party can accept such
a program as Rockefeller's, since it would be
a virtual repudiation of
the President's record.
Two interviews on television on Sunday failed
to make two of the vital
points concerning Gov.
Rockefeller's attack upon
President Eisenhower
and Vice President Nixon:
They failed to bring out
the fact that the Vice
President has already
made his position clear on
all of the 10 points on
which Rockefeller bases
his policies; and they
failed to show how closely the Rockefeller program resembles that advocated by at least three
of the current Democratic candidates for the
nomination.
I have great admiration
for Lawrence Spivak's
"Meet the Press" program. The panel on Sunday was excellent—honest, straightforward, informed. But there was
a time limit, and Rockefeller was loquacious. He
filled in valuable time
with generalities. The
panel failed to bring out
that on every one of the
10 points in the Rockefeller "platform" Nixon
has already made his position clear.
★
Also, except for one
question, "What distinguishes you from a Democrat?"—which Rockefeller answered with
mere generalities—there
was no development point
by point of the fact that
his "10 points" are almost precisely what three
of the Democratic candidates have been saying
for months.
I have no admiration
for the Susskind "Open
End" program. The inquisitor is a showman
who, like most of his profession, follows a leftist
