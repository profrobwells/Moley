Among those people
whose business it is to ap-
praise the services of sen-
ators and representatives,
both Sens. Kennedy and
Symington rate very low
marks. On the other hand,
Sen. Johnson, another
hopeful, rates very high.
This was the judgment of
50 Washington corre-
spondents who were polled
by Newsweek magazine.
A poll of this kind is
very significant because
the Washington corps of
newspapermen is not only
continuously on the job
watching things but they
have the confidences of
the members themselves
and know how they rate
their colleagues.
Not only is Congress
the best of training
schools in politics and
government but each
House is a closely knit
club in which members
work together many
months in every year.

The members heard
about most in the home
states and districts are
not usually the ones who
get the work done in Con-
gress. Oratory gets the
headlines, but laws are
made by people who la-
bor long hours in commit-
tee rooms and in their of-
fices.
Often a member's serv-
ices are little appreciated
at home. In 1954, Sen.
Guy Cordon was defeated
in Oregon because he was
kept in Washington by an
unusually long session of
the Senate and by a
mountain of committee
work dealing with the vi-
tal interests of the North-
west until late in Septem-
ber of election year. So
the words of Richard
Neuberger prevailed over
the work of Cordon by a
majority averaging about
one vote a precinct.
In the Newsweek poll,
the highest rating of all
went to Johnson. Forty-
one of the 50 chose him.
Next was Speaker Sam
Rayburn, with 36, and aft-
er him Minority Leader
Charles Halleck with 27.
Sen. Kennedy was chosen
by only 17 of the 50 who
voted, and no one named
Symington.
A vote which was rich-
ly deserved but which
will surprise many Amer-
icans was the 25 for Ger-
ald Ford Jr., Republican
of Grand Rapids, Mich.
His capacity and industry
have won him great re-
spect. Among his admir-
ers is Vice President Nix-
on, and it is a fair bet
that if Nixon is nominat-
ed and has the choice of
a running mate Ford will
be his favorite.
Leslie Arends, the Re-
publican House whip, also
received 25 votes, while
Walter Judd of Minnesota
followed with 20.

In the House, after Ray-
burn, the highest rating
went to Wilbur Mills,
Ways and Means chair-
man; Bolling of Missouri;
Bowles of Connecticut
(for what reason, I can-
not see) and Majority
Leader McCormack.
Considering the im-
mense amount of public-
ity which Kennedy and
Symington have been get-
ting as Presidential aspir-
ants, the lack of enthusi-
asm for Kennedy and the
complete neglect of Sy-
mington; are significant.
The emergence of both as
national figures is most
strange.
Kennedy's constructive
contributions in his entire
14 years in Congress have
been negligible. His
length of service has giv-
en him a fairly high sen-
iority on his committees.
In his last election for
senator he had a big ma-
jority.
*
But he has never
seemed to exert himself
greatly in legislative
work ror has he made
very notable contributions
to Senate debate. His in-
fection with the Presiden-
tial virus has stirred in-
credible energy, however,
which with ample finan-
cial means has created
the showing he has had
in the primaries. But as
a candidate for President
his capacities will be very
carefully evaluated, per-
haps with surprising re-
sults in November.
The Symington record
is wholly mediocre. The
amazing thing is that he
should be taken seriously
as a candidate for Presi-
dent. Of all the Democrat-
ic hopefuls, only Johnson
has a record which is rec-
ognized by those who
know him best and work
with him.
