RAYMOND MOLEY:
Japan Rioting Unlike
Any Other in World
Many American liberals
and "intellectuals" have
been inclined to regard the
recent events in Japan as
a genuine protest of edu-
cated people against the
western world. This arises
from a total misunder-
standing of the conditions
and methods which have
given rise to the disorder-
ly attack upon law, order
and democratic processes.
Adlal Stevenson, who is
likely to equate intellectu-
als of all countries, sug-
gested the identity of the
student uprisings in Japan
with those in Turkey and
added: "Has it now come
to pass that professors,
students, and ideas are
more powerful and effec-
tive than weapons and
military aid?"
If he had been well in-
formed about the educated
people in Japan, he would
not have identified the
disorderly conduct there
with the protests in Tur-
key, nor with our own
ideological problems.
To get a clear under-
standing of the riotous be-
havior of the Japanese
educators and students,
certain facts peculiar to
Japanese traditions and to
the infiltration of the
ranks of teachers and stu-
dents by Communists
must be understood by
Americans. These facts
have no counterpart else-
where in the world.

In an article published
in Japan by Kiyoaki Mura-
ta several weeks ago,
considerable light is
thrown upon the subject.
He says that unlike the
American people, who have
come to evaluate in their
own terms and with com-
mon sense what professors
and students say and do,
the Japanese people gen-
erally pay profound atten-
tion to their educated elite.
He also suggests that
while a certain amount of
book learning is widely
prevalent in Japan, the
capacity of its educated
people in understanding
the operation of the
democratic political sys-
tem is not. Murata points
out that the present-day
educated and cultural elite
tend to reject individual-
ism and tend to a group
action. This is what he
calls "mental feudalism."
Hence, 75% of a certain
group of university profes-
sors joined in a protest
against the security treaty
with the United States, al-
though few understood
what it meant. Another
item of importance is that
the intellectuals hate to be
regarded as "reactionary"
and hence join in all pro-
test movements.
They moved in a mass
against the proposal to
strengthen the police laws
in 1958, the effort to estab-
lish efficiency ratings for
teachers in 1959, and the
security treaty in 1960.

This created rich soil for
hard-bitten Communists
with sufficient education
and imported money to in-
filtrate their ranks. The re-
sult was the growth of the
Zengakuren, the national
association of students'
self-government associa-
tions, and the resultant
riotous attacks upon the
democratically elected
government of the nation.
Automatically, all Japa-
nese students become
members of some sort of
"self-government" associa-
tion. Like many students
everywhere, they are im-
patient of authority, while
they are still incapable of
self-government. They are
induced by their leaders to
be against the school au-
thorities, the state, the
government and the po-
lice. Hence, the riotous
conduct of which we heard
over the past weeks.
The result is not what
Stevenson suggests, the
triumph of "ideas" over
more visible means of au-
thority and American aid.
It is a blind acceptance of
a mass action skillfully di-
rected by alien Communist
influence, well financed by
money from Red China.
