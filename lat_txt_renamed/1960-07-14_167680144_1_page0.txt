Every four years, on the
eve of each of our great
political conventions, a
handful of men gather and
in a spastic performance
come up with what is
known as the party's po-
litical platform.
Almost always it is like
a dress that is worn but
once. For it is little more
than a combination of gen-
eralities and compromises
roughly stitched, stapled,
Scotch-taped and basted
together to give the politi-
cal party some garb to
wear in public for a short
time.
To change the figure of
speech, the whole business
is rather like seeing a col-
lapsed balloon dragged out
of storage, scrubbed off,
patched, touched up with
some new decorations and,
with much pulling and
hauling, much huffing and
puffing, inflated to a size
that will lift it off the
ground and for a time at-
tract the attention of as
many spectators as bother
to look up.
We cannot say that our
party platforms are a "true
reflection" of what the
mass parties stand for. And
from experience we see
that for the most part
promises contained therein
are neither binding nor de-
voutly respected.
Most candidates go on to
state their own program
during a campaign. Once
elected, they are even more
inclined to disregard plat-
form promises.
If this sounds a bit harsh
on an esteemed and ven-
erable political exercise of
our democracy, dust off
the 1932 Democratic plat-
form and read that a Dem-
ocratic administration
would reverse the big
spending, big government
policies of the Republicans
and handle the depression
with "an immediate and
drastic reduction of gov-
ernment expenditures
to accomplish a saving of
not less than 25% in the
cost of federal govern-
ment."
Of 1956 pledges, the par-
ties have made good on
but one-statehood for Ha-
waii and Alaska.
There are other ways by
which the aspirations of
party membership might
find a greater measure of
fulfillment. Efforts should
be made to de-emphasize
the party platform and the
way it is concocted.
We might look to an-
other land for another ap-
proach. Britain has an in-
stitution which we might
study. It is the annual con-
ference. The Conserva-
tive and Labor Parties
hold annual conferences
for two and one-half and
four and one-half days.
They are attended by local
constituency leaders, party
officials, hard-working sup-
porters, members of Par-
liament and, for the party
in power, ministers.
At a conference, debate
and discussion flourish
and certain resolutions
may be passed, although
they are not binding upon
elected party members.
British political life in
the 1920s and 1930s was
studded with spectacular
debates at these confer-
ences, but recently the
conference has served
more as a source of stimu-
lation to the constituency
representatives who at-
tend and as a demonstra-
tion of party solidarity.
One chairman put it
pungently, "In a way, this
is the powerhouse for
next year's propaganda
for the good old Tory
Party."
One minister explained
two advantages the an-
nual conference gave a
minister: "In the first
place, it enabled him to
gauge to some extent the
feeling in the party about
any proposal with which
he was concerned; and in
the second place, if any
criticism was called forth
(by conference proposals)
it might give him an op-
portunity to answer such
criticism."
Also, meeting every
year rather than every
four years gives both
British parties an oppor-
tunity to thrash out and
perhaps achieve solidarity
on important problems
that tend to crop up unex-
pectedly.
Something along the an-
nual conference line could
replace our ineffectual
party platform device and
the feeble approach of-
fered by "advisory com-
mittees."
This could bring to-
gether annually congres-
sional leaders, governors,
state chairmen, national
committeemen, cabinet
members, and other party
leaders. Our parties might
then have something more
substantial to stand for
from year to year.
