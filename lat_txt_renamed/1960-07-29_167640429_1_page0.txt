Lo, the Poor Farmer Hasn't Fared
as Badly as the Democrats Say
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As noted in an earlier
article, I have skipped the
two conventions and in-
stead have made an auto-
mobile trip from coast to
coast, It seemed that more
perspective could be got-
ten on politics in that way
than in lurking among po-
litical figures. The experi-
ment was richly reward-
ing in what I observed
and what I heard.
I crossed three of the
states which are located in
that region which is the
center of what is called
the farm problem - Illi-
nois, Iowa and Nebraska.
Such a brief encounter
with the area is, I realize,
no way to evaluate that
so-called problem.
*
But my observation and
conversation with a num-
ber of people in the small
cities and towns provided
food for reflection, espe-
cially after hearing over
the air from the recent
Democratic convention the
screams of politicians con-
cerning the dreadful plight
of agriculture.
If we gave any credit
to what some of them are
saying, we would believe
that the farmers of the
Middle West are, in the
phrase of the late Presi-
dent Roosevelt, "living in
the shadow of peasantry."
Since that expression
was used in 1932, many
billions have been spent
to dispel that shadow, and
the end, according to the
party platforms, is not yet.
I was especially im-
pressed by the fact that
the attitude of the people
who live and do business
in the towns and small
cities differs sharply from
that of the farmers. Those
people are in no sense a
subsidized class. If they
fail, they move elsewhere.
*
They are, so far as I
could hear, not especially
sympathetic with the idea
of a permanent guarantee
of the farmers' income by
the federal government.
In short, they believe
from first-hand knowledge
that the farmers are a lot
better off than is claimed
by farm politicians.
One merchant told me
that a farmer in his county
told him that he was broke.
As a result of a few ques-
tions, the merchant elic-
ited the facts that the farm-
er was receiving $5,000
a year from the Soil Bank
Fund, that his cattle would
bring $21,000 on the mar-
ket, and that he was of-
fering his farm for sale
at a price of $50,000.
The merchant, on the
other hand, had no subsidy
and realized that if he
failed to make a living,
he would have to move.
Similar stories were told
me by proprietors of auto-
mobile repair shops and by
other small businessmen.
My conclusion is that it
would be possible for a
candidate for President to
tell the farmers the blunt
truth and to offer a pro-
gram of sound finance and
efficient government.
This would appeal not
only to the people in the
small towns and cities but
also to the millions of
middle-income people in
the suburbs of the large
cities. For the major vot-
ing power in these farm
states is no longer held by
farmers.
*
I have no hope that
such a course will be fol-
lowed. Politicians of both
parties are so profoundly
impressed by the reputed
unpopularity of Secretary
Benson, who has been tell-
ing the farmers the blunt
truth, that they will offer
enlarging benefits for the
farmers.
Perhaps the remedy for
the farm problem suggest-
ed by Will Rogers more
than 30 years ago might
apply. He said, in effect,
that the remedy would be
to plow under every other
farm politician.
