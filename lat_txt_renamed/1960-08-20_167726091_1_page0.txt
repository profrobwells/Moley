RAYMOND MOLEY:
Sober Congress Eyes
Medical Aid Plan
Never was the claptrap
which pervades a national
convention so clearly
exposed as it has been in
the proceedings of Congress
these days. In the
hot intoxication of a convention
the realist is the
forgotten man. Cynicism
reigns. Promises are
made which, if those who
make them have time to
think at all, are intended
to be in default. Somehow,
some way, those
who make them believe
that when the reckoning
comes they will find
someone to blame for
their default.
★
During the Democratic
convention in July, those
who were running things
and making the major
speeches believed that
they had two fat goats
who could be blamed if
the promises were not
kept. President Eisenhower
would be compelled to
use the veto power, and
candidate Nixon could be
pressured to match the
Democratic promises.
Chester Bowles, formerly
of a notable advertising
firm, spread into
the platform a selling line
designed to sweep the
vote markets of the nation.
The text was duly
embellished with lurid
pictures of distress on
the farms, in the cities
and in the benighted by-
ways of the republic.
★
Out of it all came a program
of health for all.
Those who were able to
read or listen with calm
reason knew that such a
program might not be enacted
into law in a dozen
years. Or, if by winning
a smashing election, a
subservient Congress
could be dominated by a
Democratic executive and
such a program could be
passed, it would repeal
the past, transform the
roles of individual and
government and eradicate
the principles behind
the Constitution of the
United States.
But when the members
of Congress returned to
Washington there were
men who would survive
regardless of the election.
These men were secure
not only in their districts
and states but in their
dominant position in Congress.
These men have
their own principles to
keep. They believe in
rules and deliberation and
the maintenance of financial
and constitutional
soundness.
★
Three of them are Sen.
Byrd, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee;
Rep. Wilbur Mills
chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee,
and Judge Howard W.
Smith of the Rules Committee
of the House. Their
influence is very great
among their colleagues. Orderly
procedure requires
that there be committee
meetings.
Under the rules, the
committee discarded the
plan advocated by Kennedy
and Johnson. Then it
adopted by a 2-1 majority
a much milder bill. The
House stands pat on what
it has already passed.
Perhaps nothing will be
passed. That would be
fortunate in this session,
for the whole subject
needs more study in an
atmosphere not crowded
by campaign expediency.
★
There needs to be verified
the number who need
aid, the number who do
not want government aid,
the number of children
able to do their moral duty
to their parents, the number
who have private insurance.
We know some of
this by ex parte evidence,
but it needs absolute verification.
And now the line is
being held by Democrats.
But these are not of the
species of Democrat which
controlled things at Los
Angeles. They are in the
tradition of Woodrow Wilson,
Al Smith, Oscar Underwood,
Carter Glass and
other notables of the past.
Their ideal is not that of
a government by, for and
of a federal bureaucracy.
Meanwhile, the August
days are getting shorter in
hours and less in number.
September is just around
the corner.
