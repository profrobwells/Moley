Vice President Nixon's
statement that he is "run-
ning scared" should not
be taken, nor is it gener-
ally taken, in its literal
sense. He eagerly sought
this nomination and has
confidence in his capacity
to exert whatever effort is
needed to, win the elec-
tion.
But there is a certain
realism in the man which
never takes things for
granted. Life has present-
ed him with many prob-
lems the outcome of
which could not confident-
ly be predicted. His habit
has been to face the reali-
ties and to make every
possible preparation for
what there is to do.
Moreover, his experi-
ence has taught him that
in politics the unexpected
is almost the normal rou-
tine.
He knows further that
with international compli-
cations what they are and
with public concern so in-
tensely centered upon
them, what happens
abroad may have much to
do with the result.
Above all, he knows
that to permit himself the
slightest indication of
overconfidence would be
to lessen the energies of
party workers over the
country. In a political
campaign it is easy for a
state, county or local
chairman, when he has la-
bored hard for months, to
fail in some detail simply
because he believes it to
be unnecessary.
These little lapses, when
multiplied manyfold,
make the big difference in
the result. A few hundred
votes may swing a state,
and a state may change the
result of a Presidential
election.
Nixon is an organization
man. He is much more
convinced that organiza-
tion is the decisive ele-
ment in winning an elec-
tion than was Willkie,
Dewey or Eisenhower.
Two occasions will serve
to illustrate the Nixon
character. When he began
to dig into the Hiss case,
very few people believed
his efforts would produce
anything but his own mor-
tification. Nixon's fellow
members on the House
committee which had the
case before it were very
dubious about proving
anything against Hiss.
They might have suspect-
ed Hiss, but they could
conceive of no adequate
proof. But with inde-
fatigable labor, Nixon suc-
ceeded.
Again, when in 1959 the
President suggested Nix-
on's visit to Russia, the
way seemed to be mined
with dangers to the Nixon
career. He knew from bit-
ter experience in South
America what deadly
traps communism can pre-
pare. But with careful
preparation for contin-
gencies, he undertook the
mission amid many mis-
givings of his friends. And
his readiness to meet the
situation served him well.
Nor was the settlement
of the steel strike a task
which any aspiring candi-
date might relish. For it
offered the chance that
neither side might be hap-
py at any solution. But the
President had asked him
to do it, and he responded.
Tough tasks and hard
fights have left their im-
print on the man. They
have given him maturity
and a more serious and re-
served mien than some
relish. Twice recently, in
traveling on the West
Coast, I have heard good
friends and supporters of
Nixon express the wish
that the Presidential can-
didate might be warmer in
his approach. One said,
"With a greater sense of
humor."
I responded with what I
have written above and
added that perhaps voters
would appreciate that seri-
ous times demand serious
leaders. And these cer-
tainly are such times.
