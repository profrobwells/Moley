RAYMOND MOLEY:
Split-Ticket Trend
Noted in Midwest
Like the late hurricane
Donna and her many sis-
ters before her, political di-
rections have unpredicta-
ble, capricious ways. Of
all campaigns of recent
years, this one offers the
most in novelty.
Whether the present in-
dications will prevail in
November involves enter-
ing an area of speculation
which this writer is too ex-
perienced to enter.
My correspondent in
Chicago, who is a close ob-
server of politics in the
Midwest, writes this in a
letter:
"Last night I talked with
some of the Evans called
'Nonpartisans for Nixon.'
One of them said, 'I am for
Nixon. I am not for the
rest of the Republican
ticket.'
"Probings in Wisconsin
indicate the same trend. In
Indiana and Illinois there
are incumbent Republican
governors, one of whom,
Gov. Stratton of Illinois, is
a candidate for re-election.
The odds are that, if the
election were held now,
both statehouses would be
carried by Democrats. But
Nixon would carry both
states.

"A fine, stalwart Repub-
lican newspaper, the Rock-
ford (111.) Morning Star, re-
cently editorially urged
the defeat of Gov. Stratton.
But it is strongly support-
ing Nixon-Lodge. The in-
dianapolis Star has
charged that the Demo-
cratic national committee-
man is trading off his na-
tional ticket for support
for the state ticket, includ-
ing the candidate for gov-
ernor.
"The word is being
passed among Democrats
that while certain Demo-
cratic candidates for high
state offices voted for the
Democratic platform in
Los Angeles they really
don't believe in all that so-
cialistic stuff."
In Iowa the situation is
similar. In the usually re-
liable poll by the farm pa-
per Wallace's Farmer, the
latest returns show that
among farmers Gov. Love-
less, a Democrat running
for the Senate, is ahead,
and Nixon is ahead of Ken-
nedy.
In the South there seems
to be no defection in sup-
port of Democratic candi-
dates from sheriff to gov-
ernor. But in several areas
Nixon-Lodge seem more
appealing than Kennedy-
Johnson. In Texas, if the
arrangement holds by
which Johnson runs for
Vice President and Senate
too, the tall man from
Johnson City may well re-
main the majority leader
in January.
In Oregon the switch is
the other way. The Repub-
lican governor, while not a
candidate this year, is
quite popular, but the
Nixon forces are badly
organized.
In earlier years a suc-
cessful Presidential candi-
date carried through the
bulk of his ticket. But the
days of the coattails are
gone. That was shown in
1948 when Truman ran
behind his candidates for
Congress.
☆
It is difficult to general-
ize about this situation.
Some may believe that
party loyalty is in the
decline with a new genera-
tion. If so, it is regretta-
ble, because a strong two-
party system is an essen-
tial to a stable political
system.
But what some believe
as a principle may not be
understood by the mass of
voters. A citizens-for-Nix-
on or for Kennedy organi-
zation is a direct invita-
tion to split the ticket.
But those who wish it
that way cannot be
stopped and, since it is
their right to organize as
they choose, they will con-
tinue, regardless of what
happens to the party as a
whole.
On the Republican side
the weakness of so many
state and local organiza-
tions seems to make such
groups necessary.
It may be, as one
shrewd observer has it,
that this year the Presi-
dency is being weighed
on scales different from
candidates for lesser of-
fices. There is also, es-
pecially in Illinois and In-
diana, considerable dis-
content with the way state
affairs have been conduct-
ed under Republican con-
trol.
All this might lead the
reader to believe that
this is a prediction of a
sweep for Nixon. That is
not to be assumed. For
the election may well be
decided in California,
New York and Pennsyl-
vania, which present some-
what different equations.
