RAYMOND MOLEY:
Lawlessness Again
Perils Goals of U.N.
There is enough in the
newspapers these days to
suggest to any thoughtful
person that a hope, cen-
turies old, may again be
frustrated. Consider these
items appearing on one
morning on the front page
of one newspaper:
The Soviet representa-
tive to the Security Coun-
cil charges that Secretary
General Dag Hammar-
skjold is preventing a Con-
go solution.
*
Khrushchev claims that
to perform his "duties" at
the United Nations he
must be permitted to
wander where he wishes
over New York State, de-
spite security precautions
to confine him to Manhat-
tan Island.
Castro is coming to the
U.N. meeting with a bag
of accusations against the
United States.
Over in Ghana there is
a threat to abandon the
United Nations force in the
Congo.
Russia rejects protests
by the western powers
against Berlin curbs. The
Soviet says that East Ger-
many has full sovereignty.
United Nations in Leo-
poldville backs down from
its authority to control
Congo radio and airports.
On another day we
learned that the Organiza-
tion of American States
has been negative in its
attitude toward Soviet in-
tervention in Cuba.
★
And on day after day
we learn of the vast sums
that the United States is
pouring into foreign aid all
over the world to win
friends and influence peo-
ple.
There are about to enter
the United Nations formal-
ly a whole bevy of African
so-called nations whose de-
gree of development in the
conduct of parliamentary
democracy is a delusion.
Running back over these
items, let us see what they
suggest:
1—That the United Na-
tions, designed as a forum
for the adjustment of in-
ternational differences, is
regarded by most partici-
pants as a propaganda de-
vice to advance national
claims and Communist ide-
ology.
2—That the idea em-
bodied in Article X of the
old League of Nations
charter and of the provi-
sion in the United Nations
for the use of U.N. police
action in small wars was
and is an illusion.
3—That the Wilsonian
dream, that granting a geo-
graphical area and its in-
habitants independence is
in itself a guarantee of
free, orderly democracy, is
denied by the rise of half-
civilized and barbarian dic-
tatorships. Force, and
force alone, prevails over
the forms of parliamentary
government.
★
4—That communism,
which dominates half the
world, cares neither for in-
ternational federation nor
for the independence of na-
tions. It is intent on one
aim and one alone: world
conquest and Communist
imperialism.
5—That much if not all
of the money we have
spent for the kindly pur-
poses expressed by Presi-
dents Truman and Eisen-
hower, Secretary Marshall
and other secretaries of
state has been wasted. And
much of it has been used
against us.
6—That the concept of
regional arrangements
within a world order, em-
bodied in such hopeful be-
ginnings as the Organiza-
tion of American States,
does not in practice work.
★
Meanwhile, we are lulled
by the idealists, God bless
them, who have vested too
much faith in paper ar-
rangements.
The foregoing is written
not in a spirit of complete
pessimism, but it is real-
istic. Hope still rests on
those free nations with the
strength to sustain their
purposes and their own se-
curity force, until the
dawn of reason.
