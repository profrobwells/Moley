TOKYO—The Japanese
nation and its dominant
conservative party have
survived the upheavals in
June when President Ei-
senhower's visit was post-
poned.
But there is apprehen-
sion here, and among many
Americans over here who
understand Japan's prob-
lems, about the impact of
that incident upon public
opinion in the United
States.
*
According to a sound-
ing of American opinion by
an expert agency, more
than half of Americans
believe Japan to be an un-
dependable ally. Only a
third believe Japan to be a
dependable friend. More
than a half favor a de-
crease in American-Japa-
nese trade, while only a
tenth favor its increase.
This is most unfortu-
nate in the light of our
position in the Far East,
our national security and
our concern in preventing
further expansion of Com-
munist imperialism in
Asia.
★
Contrary to this pes-
simism among so many
Americans, Japan as a na-
tion, its dominant political
leaders, and its business
community are not only
very anxious to be our ally
and friend but are con-
vinced that continued and
expanded trade is neces-
sary to both nations.
The new prime minister,
Hayato Ikeda, who suc-
ceeded Nobusuke Kishi,
not only is determined to
cement better relations
with the United States but
is likely to be able, with
some sympathetic help
from us, to make sure that
the unfortunate disorders
of June do not happen
again.
His party, the Liberal
Democrats, are at the mo-
ment firmly in the major-
ity in the government. Re-
cent local elections have
shown an increased ma-
jority vote for that party.
★
The plan is to dissolve
the Diet in October and to
go to the country in a gen-
eral election in November.
This will be in the nature
of a vote of confidence
which will enable the gov-
ernment to strengthen it-
self against such disorders
as have threatened it in
the past.
This confidence in the
continuance of control by
a party which is friendly
to the United States seems
to be well justified. The
Socialist opposition not
only is divided but is, as
a party, in a very shaky
position.
However, it is doubtful
whether the conservative
leaders are aware of the
seriousness of the situation
in their country. The dis-
turbances in June of this
year against the security
treaty with the United
States and against the Ki-
shi government, together
with the riots in Novem-
ber 1958, were possible
largely because the gov-
ernment is legally with-
out the power to protect
itself against alien subver-
sion and internal disorders.
*
The weakness in the
government's police power
is in turn due to the fan-
tastic imposition of re-
straints by some of the
bureaucrats in the Ameri-
can occupation.
It has no real laws
against subversion, no offi-
cial secrets law, and an
inadequate national police
force. For example, the
police know what funds
are being smuggled in,
but have no power to
arrest the people who are
receiving and using them.
★
There is no adequate
control of trade with Red
China. That trade is used
to provide funds for the
people who are attempting
to overthrow the govern-
ment. There will be a
shipment of some commod-
ity from China, for in-
stance, but the money
which it brings stays in
Japan and is turned over
to the subversive appa-
ratus.
That apparatus must be
broken by a reform in the
laws and the police admin-
istration must be made
capable of enforcing such
laws.
