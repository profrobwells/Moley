RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nixon's Experience
and Democrat Logic
In the Nixon-Kennedy
debate a question con-
cerned the experience of
the Vice President in de-
cision making at the top
level of government. It is
apparent that the oppo-
sition must break down
this claim for Nixon, since
it is perhaps the most pow-
erful influence with voters
at this critical time.
Unfortunately, the Pres-
ident failed in his press
conference to let the mat-
ter stand with his state-
ment that he and he alone
made the final decisions.
Instead, he made a fa-
cetious remark.

But the opposition to
Nixon fails to see the di-
lemma into which they are
blundering by their claim.
For in one breath they say
that the Eisenhower de-
cisions were terrible and
in the next they absolve
Nixon from any responsi-
bility in making terrible
decisions.
As long ago as when
Aristotle wrote his "Rhet-
oric," in the fourth century
BC, it has been recognized
that in politics what is said
is for psychological effect.
It has little to do with
logic. Since so many of us
are not likely to follow the
rules of logic, those who
seek our votes disregard it
as they will.
Occasionally, this license
is pursued to such extremes
that common sense rebels.
That must be apparent in
this instance.
Prof. Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. has written a slim
book, just published, which
is not what one would ex-
pect, unless he knows of
the professor's views, from
a Harvard historian.

It is a furious diatribe di-
rected at Vice President
Nixon-a complete text of
academic billingsgate. Nix-
on is assailed on all sides
-his taste, his manner of
speech, his attitude toward
his wife-the sort of per-
sonal attack which both
candidates, more knowl-
edgeable in public reac-
tions, studiously avoid. For
an attack like that invites
a devastating counter-re-
action. It causes those who
read to question the good
faith of the author, not the
subject.
Schlesinger is at great
pains to attack the claim
that Nixon has had the ex-
perience at high-level de-
cision making that has
trained him for the Presi-
dency, while he assails the
Eisenhower decisions all
along the line.
★
No doubt Prof. Schle-
singer learned in his his-
tory lessons about the fa-
mous Morton's Fork. Mor-
ton was Archbishop of
Canterbury during the
reign of the grasping,
avaricious Henry VII. It
was his job to exact money
from the clergy.
His rule, when he found
an impoverished bishop,
was to say that no doubt
he had money since he was
not spending it. When he
found an opulent prelate,
he claimed that he could
well afford the levy. In
modern terms, "You're
damned if you do, and
you're damned if you
don't."
It is true that the Presi-
dent said that he and he
alone made the final de-
cisions at all times. That is
as it should be. And that is
what Nixon should hope
he would say. For it would
give him, if elected Presi-
dent, freedom to make dif-
ferent decisions.
A noted commentator,
an Oxford product, has
said that if Dulles could
hear the claim that Nixon
had a hand in shaping for-
eign policy he would
"turn over in his grave."
★
Now let us see what
Dulles really thought
about Nixon's participa-
tion in making foreign
policy. In a book, "Duel at
the Brink," co-authored by
an honest commentator,
Roscoe Drummond, there
is this passage:
"Dulles, in turn, could
be unusually thoughtful of
the families of friends and
associates. Example: He
was aware that Vice Presi-
dent Nixon was scrupu-
lously obedient to the se-
crecy requirements of
cabinet meetings.
"He knew that Nixon
never related anything of
them to his wife Pat. Pe-
riodically Dulles would
phone her and recount an
incident in which her hus-
band had handled himself
well or had won the
praise of the President."
