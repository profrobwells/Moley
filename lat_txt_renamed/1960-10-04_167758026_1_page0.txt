RAYMOND MOLEY:
TV Debate Failure
Lies in Presentation
This merely adds a bit
of volume to the roar of
catcalls, foot stamping and
desk pounding that has
been directed at the awful
flop of the enormous in-
dustry that is still trying
to be an art—television.
The Nixon-Kennedy de-
bate offered, to use that
Kennedy cliche, a "chal-
lenge" to television. To
borrow again from the
candidate, if this is "the
New Frontier" of enter-
tainment, then let us turn
back and run like every-
thing to the days when
crowds were addressed
with only raw vocal cords
and the background was a
barnlike public hall or a
street corner. Or let us
have a return to the Globe
Theater of Shakespeare's
day.

I have heard more than
one witness to the horror
liken the scene, which an
estimated 80 million wit-
nessed, to the Sing Sing
death chamber. Lacking
only were a clergyman
chanting a prayer and a
policeman or two. All the
rest was an accurate verisi-
militude to that ghoulish
scene.
Another comparison I
have heard was to the first
scene of Thornton Wilder's
"Our Town," where there
was nothing on the stage
at all and the audience was
confronted only with the
grim brick walls of the the-
ater and the narrator
dragging out a kitchen
chair.
Is this what we might
expect from the horde em-
ployed by the networks—
scenery designers, light-
ing experts, make-up art-
ists and other production
geniuses supported by
revenue from beer, ciga-
rettes and deodorants?
Lincoln and Douglas had
no such allegedly artistic
army to help. They sup-
plied their own histrionics.
The handsome, well-tai-
lored Douglas was a con-
summate actor. Lincoln
was an image maker with-
out help from Madison
Avenue. When he rose to
respond, he was dressed in
a long duster, and to take
the audience interest from
his opponent he slowly un-
buttoned the whole gar-
ment, in the center of the
stage, from neck to ankle.

Now, in this age, the
participants had a right to
expect the details of pro-
duction to be supplied by
the experts. But they were
perched on chairs which
were suitable for the place
of shame occupied by the
school dunce.
Nobody seemed to re-
member that the Vice
President had a stiff and
sore knee. He had to as-
sume a posture while
seated which looked like
a man who had happened
to sit down on a hot grid-
dle of pancakes.
The podium from which
they were compelled to
speak was merely a slim
post surmounted by a
slab; legs and feet were
in full view like the ex-
tremities of a couple of
horse thieves hanging
from a tree.
*
Kennedy and Nixon
were too far apart for
such chums, polite adver-
saries, former fellow con-
gressmen.
The four spooks in the
foreground who were sup-
posed to provide questions
were extracted from
among the networks' news-
men. By their questions
they indicated that they
might know more about
gang warfare and ware-
house fires than the na-
tional issues in one of the
most complex and critical
periods in American pol-
itics.
It is small wonder that
the participants, both sea-
soned campaigners, acted
with the nervousness of a
couple of 12-year-olds re-
citing. "The Turk who in
his guarded tent lay
dreaming of the hour..."
Since a writer is con-
stantly challenged to be
"constructive," here are a
few suggestions:
Eliminate the networks'
newsmen. Have as moder-
ator a mature, respected,
well-informed and perfect-
ly impartial federal Court
of Appeals judge. Have
the setting in a room like
a well-appointed private
chamber of a judge.
Let the participants sit
in nice, comfortable leath-
er chairs.
*
Have a series of issues—
a few rather than many—
agreed upon in advance.
Then get down to brass
tacks and let the judge
keep the participants to
the point, just as any com-
petent judge does with op-
posing lawyers.
The American people,
even though they may
break many laws, respect
their courts. They can un-
derstand this sort of
search for truth and a
matching of arguments.
Another such television
gaffe as we had and most
of the 80 million will go to
bed on the succeeding oc-
casions.
