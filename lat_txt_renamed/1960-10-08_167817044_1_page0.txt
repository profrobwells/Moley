Even Democrats See
Greatness of Hoover
It was noteworthy that
in Sen. Kennedy's listing of
the horrible examples of
Republicans from whom he
aspires to deliver us, the
names were Harding, Coo-
lidge, Landon, Willkie and
Dewey.
Note that one name was
missing from his category
of Republican "rascals":
the name of Herbert Hoo-
ver. And so, after many
years, a Democratic can-
didate for President is not
running against Hoover.
This remarkable change
is due to the fact that aft-
er being the object of many
years of partisan attack the
ex-President has emerged
as one of the most revered
individuals of the nation.
He has been called to the
public service by Presidents
Truman and Eisenhower
and has labored with great
dignity, moral force and
enlightened public service
far beyond the span of life
allotted to most men.
At 86 he is working a
dozen hours a day in his
apartment in New York,
keeping seven or more sec-
retaries and research as-
sistants busy; personally
answering thousands of
letters; meeting with his
friends, including the no-
table men of his time;
usually having guests at
breakfast, lunch and din-
ner; giving advice when
asked; encouraging at all
times the energies of
younger men in asserting
the moral leadership of
the United States in the
world.

It was Hoover who first
urged the nomination of
Henry Cabot Lodge as
Nixon's running mate.
That was a manifestation
of discernment which the
popularity of Lodge as a
candidate is proving.
While Sen. Johnson has
become almost the forgot-
ten man on the Kennedy
ticket, there is no doubt
even among Democrats
that Lodge is a great asset
to the Nixon ticket.
As thousands can testi-
fy, the writing of an au-
thoritative book is a pro-
digious task. It involves
research and consultations
and hours, days and weeks
of writing.
Most professors half
Hoover's age believe that
one book in three years is a
real achievement.
In 1951, when Hoover
turned 77, there appeared
the first of three thick and
well-documented volumes
of his memoirs. He was in
his 80th year when Pres-
ident Eisenhower called
him to the immense task
of making a survey of the
U.S. government.
That became the second
Hoover Commission, and
the report comprised a
whole shelf of books, all of
which Hoover was re-
quired to plan, supervise
and edit.

These labors were
broken by trips to Ger-
many in 1954 and Belgium
in 1958.
As a sort of by-product
of his major "An American
Epic" he produced his "Or-
deal of Woodrow Wilson"
in 1958, a best seller.
Within the last 12
months two sizable vol-
umes of "An American
Epic" have been pub-
lished, and half of Vol. III
is in the hands of the pub-
lishers, to appear early
next year.
In these days when cor-
poration executives, pro-
fessors and many others
are considered past their
usefulness and are retired
at 65, this personal exam-
ple of usefulness is some-
thing monumental. It is a
challenge to our customs
and traditions. It is vivid
proof that in general we
waste our years. We do
not wear out with work.
*
And the volumes of "An
American Epic" are not
simply dry statistical re-
ports. They are a moving
story of American gener-
osity in the period after
World War I began in
1914 to the present. In 45
years our help has saved
the lives of more than a
billion human beings.
The man who initiated
these programs of help
says this of the American
effort.
"The return to our peo-
ple has come through the
demonstration to the
world of the ideals and
power of a free people.
And we have satisfied our
conscience that we have
not neglected our duty as
'our brother's keeper.'"
This is something to
keep in mind these days
while, in a forum which
in large measure was pro-
vided by the United
States, we are assailed as
"imperialists" and "colo-
nizers" and "exploiters of
others' misery" by the
rulers of nations, including
the Soviet Union, which
have been the glad recipi-
ents of this help.
