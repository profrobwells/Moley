RAYMOND MOLEY:
Television Debates
Fail to Instruct Us
There are so many mi-
nor but interesting things
going on in this campaign
that voters are having a
hard time concentrating
on their job of choosing
the man who may have as
much to do with all of us
as anyone since George
Washington.
Some of these diversions
appear in the printed com-
ment on the debates; oth-
ers in the whirlwind cam-
paigning of the candidates.
I am not sure but that
the old method of cam-
paigning was best. It
kept the candidates most-
ly at home and apart from
each other. As proof I cite
the front porch campaign
of McKinley in 1896. In
that year people had a
chance to think. And they
selected a man whose
administration made
good his promise to bring
prosperity.
*
Heaven knows what
would have happened if
voters had decided to ac-
cept the nostrums of Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, who
preached his inflationary
nonsense, as Mencken once
said, throughout "the
rustic byways of the Re-
public."
Let us take a sober look
at the debates. I suggest
several counts against
them as an educational
method-and public edu-
cation is the real name
for a rational campaign for
office.
In the first place, they
are merely a mechanical
device to permit the curi-
ous to satisfy the lust in
people to see something or
somebody important or in-
teresting. I have never
seen James Madison or
Edmund Burke, but I have
been instructed by them
far more than any states-
men in modern times.
I never saw Woodrow
Wilson until one hot
Fourth of July at Mt. Ver-
non in 1918, but I knew
and admired him for his
words and deeds. I never
saw a purple cow, but I
am willing to accept au-
thoritative evidence that
none such exists.
*
Sure, the public asserts
its right to see, and a can-
didate must obey the voice
of the people. But in writ-
ing unpopular articles like
this, I conceive it to be my
prerogative and duty to
say what ought to be rath-
er than what people want
to read or hear.
I am convinced that
Vice President Nixon
clearly indicated the su-
periority of his wisdom
and mental equipment
over Sen. Kennedy in the
second debate. But he re-
vealed more of the real
Nixon in his well-thought-
out and comprehensive ac-
ceptance speech in Chica-
go than a hundred debates
could show.
This sort of debate, like
a spelling bee, tests only
glibness of speech and re-
tentiveness of memory. I
am a veteran with a good
many years of teaching
students of all ages and I
know that the soundest
students who have done
best in the world were not
the ones with the quick
answers,
*
Moreover, debates like
these run so fast that the
average mortal cannot pos-
sibly absorb enough to
form a judgment of the is-
sues. It has been calculat-
ed that the contestants ut-
ter 183 words a minute.
That is much faster than
most good stenographers
can take dictation. And
any good stenographer can
take dictation as fast as
any man should speak if
he is to make sense.
This piece, like every-
thing else I write for pub-
lication, is not dictated. It
is laboriously typed after
a sketch in longhand. If I
dictate, the words pour
out so fast that in revi-
sion most words are found
to be superfluous.
The use of the press
quiz as a pattern for the
debate is wrong. As one
newspaper says, "What is
so all-fired important
about the press that the
whole discussion must be
dominated by reporters'
various prejudices and
interests?"
â˜…
The Wall Street Jour-
nal likens it to a tennis
match in which the view-
ers are supposed to count
points for perspiration,
makeup, and, as in ten-
nis, how a serve is re-
turned.
Rushing from reporter
to reporter, and subject
to subject, from farms to
Castro to Lumumba to
Abraham Lincoln, is like
a three-ring circus where
necks are whirling from
side to side, leaving a
blur of comprehension.
I suggest, since we must
have a fourth debate, that
it return to the normal
procedure: An introdue-
tory statement by each
on a specific topic, either
national security, foreign
affairs or economic
growth. Then the rebut-
tals. No one on the screen
but the principals. This,
at least, could clarify one
big issue.
