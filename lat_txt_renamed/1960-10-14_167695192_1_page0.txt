The Practice of 'Crowdsmanship'
Obscures Issues of the Campaign
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Perhaps the incredibly
rapid 'hopping of candi-
dates from city to city and
state to state is respon-
sible for the failure of re-
porters to tell us what
they are saying. Thus, we
have accounts in which
nothing is reported but es-
timates of the size of the
crowds. This is "crowds-
manship."
It is well known by vet-
erans in newspapering
that even police reports of
crowds are but the va-
guest guesses. On one occa-
sion two police estimates
of crowds at an event in
Chicago differed so widely
that the report was a
standing joke for years.
A crowd gathers be-
cause something unusual
has happened or is hap-
pening. The sure lure is a
fight or an accident or a
fire. Or a celebrity such
as a movie star or Casey
Stengel or Floyd Patter-
son. Or some of the in-
ternational heads of state
who have been clogging
New York's streets these
last few weeks.

Statesmen are common-
place in Washington and
attract little attention. But
a noted political figure
who is not known to a spe-
cific locality brings out
the crowds. In 1928 Gov.
Alfred E. Smith was not
well known outside New
York except through the
newspapers. But he was
interesting and unusual on
the national scene.
He was a born actor
with inimitable manner-
isms which he could effec-
tively project. He had the
crowds that year. Herbert
Hoover was not new to
the country and his draw-
ing power in the streets
was negligible. But he got
the votes in November.
Crowds are also assem-
bled by organized effort.
An efficient political ma-
chine can produce a crowd
by orders from the boss to
the ward and district lead-
ers. Or a candidate can get
crowds merely by select-
ing the hours when people
are in the streets every
day.
Only the naive are de-
ceived by public curiosity.
A certain statesman who,
after his defeat for high
office, still believed that
he was a popular idol was
being interviewed by Kyle
Palmer, the shrewd and
experienced political edi-
tor of the Los Angeles
Times.

The fading statesman
said, "If I went down to
that stand in the street to
buy a cigar, I would draw
a crowd." Palmer an-
swered, "So would a man
with six fingers on one
hand."
When Lady Godiva, to
secure from her husband,
the Lord of Coventry, the
promise to ease the taxes
on the poor, clad only in
her long tresses rode her
horse through the streets,
the husband used his pow-
er to keep the people in-
doors. Only one man ap-
peared, and he lives in
doubtful fame as Peeping
Tom. But the exploit still
attracts attention, and the
statue of the nude on
horseback graces the pub-
lic square of Coventry.
Candidate Kennedy, to
make sure that nothing is
missing, has added a psy-
chologist to his large staff
of image makers, econo-
mists and historians. His
specialty seems not only
to be the counting of
crowds but, by peering
into faces, measuring "sci-
entifically" their degree of
enthusiasm. He is from
the faculty of the Univer-
sity of California. He
measures the effect of spe-
cific Kennedy words and
phrases on crowd temper-
ature.

This indeed is "sci-
entism" carried to an ex-
treme degree. He should
have been on the job
when Huey Long was talk-
ing to the "wool hats."
There he could really
have gotten material for a
sizable volume. Huey
was no scientist, but he
knew how to fetch 'em.
All this is what might
be called the "feedback"
habit which has become
so prominent in public af-
fairs these days. It is in-
telligently excoriated in
Jacques Barzun's fine
book, "The House of In-
tellect."
Leadership has sunk in-
to "followship." Take a
poll and follow the lead
of what people think they
think. Never tell them
what they need. Find out
what they want and then
promise it.
★
Millions talk about poli-
tics these days but usual-
ly in terms of amateur ap-
praisals of what effect this
or that has upon whom.
But what they should con-
sider is the choice of can-
didates and issues. Any-
body can guess about
crowd reactions, even pro-
fessors.
