RETREAT WON'T INSURE PEACE
Chiang's Forces Have Defended
and Will Defend Quemoy-Matsu
Since President Eisen-
hower's release of the let-
ter to Sen. Green, from
which Sen. Kennedy quot-
ed a part out of context,
the campaign can now go
on to other issues, leaving
the voters to make the de-
cision. But certain final
vital information may be
helpful.
These islands are a part
of the sovereign territory
of the Nationalist govern-
ment on Formosa, which
has not asked the United
States to participate in
their defense with its
forces. The forces of
Chiang Kai-shek have suc-
cessfully defended the is-
lands during three at-
tacks already—in 1949,
1954, and 1958.

At the time of the 1958
attack, the Red Chinese
forces were driven off
with a loss estimated at
16,000. The forces there
are prepared to defend
the islands again if nec-
essary.
The only way the is-
lands can be given up
would be to force Chiang
Kai-shek to relinquish
them. In the evacuation
of their population and de-
fense forces to Formosa,
the Red Chinese would
probably make trouble in
the Formosa Strait, which
would certainly bring in
American forces.
The Red Chinese have
never limited their de-
clared objectives to these
islands. They have avowed
their intention to take
Formosa itself. The bomb-
ing of the islands at inter-

mittent intervals is a di-
versionary affair, no doubt
to screen their advances
elsewhere in Southeast
Asia and on the border of
India.
We may be assured that
Moscow has no interest in
the ambitions of Red Chi-
na in conquering these is-
lands and Formosa. But
Moscow is really con-
cerned about the imperi-
alistic expansion of Red
China into India. For Rus-
sia has always sought ex-
pansion to the Indian
Ocean and the Mediterra-
nean and would greatly
resent having the Chinese
get in their way.
In fact, the Crimean
War was fought with Brit-
ain and France as allies
because they saw the
czar's move into Turkey
as a preliminary to an at-
tempt to dominate the
route to the Indian Ocean
and to Britain's interests
in India.

Russian ambitions have
not changed with a trans-
fer of power from the
czars to the Communists.
Hence, the Kremlin's sus-
picions of its Red Chinese
ally's ambitions not only
to the north but the south.
Our best authority on
communism in the Far
East, Walter Robertson,
who retired in 1959 as as-
sistant secretary of state
for Far-Eastern affairs,
issued a statement last
week that "50,000 free Chi-
nese live on Quemoy and
Matsu, where their ances-
tors have lived for cen-
turies."
"Even if we felt no moral
qualm in delivering these
50,000 men, women and
children to the slavery of
the Communist-controlled
mainland, it would be
naive to assume that this
appeasement would either
remove or reduce the risk
of war in the Taiwan
Strait... The Red Chi-
nese assert in unequivocal
terms their purpose to
take Taiwan by force.
They warn that the risk of
war can be avoided only by
the complete withdrawal
of U.S. forces from the Tai-
wan Strait."

To force Formosa to sur-
render the islands would
therefore invite a full-scale
attack on Formosa itself,
which even Kennedy as-
serts we should meet with
our military strength.
Kennedy might easily
assemble military opinion
that many other spots in
the free world are inde-
fensible and that a Com-
munist attack upon them
would risk a general war.
Anyone can see that West
Berlin could not be saved
if Moscow decided to in-
vade it.
Why, then, should Que-
moy and Matsu be singled
out by Kennedy as the
first place to give ground?
Even Japan could not sur-
vive an attack without our
assistance. Nor West Ger-
many itself.
Churchill warned the
House of Commons after
the evacuation at Dun-
kirk that "wars are not
won by retreating." Nor
is peace assured by a re-
Robertson continued, treat.
