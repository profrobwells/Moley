A QUESTION OF BIGOTRY
Reuther's Blunder on Religious
Issue Discredits His Leadership
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Four facts about Walter
Reuther, vice president of
the CIO and president of
the UAW, have never be-
fore been doubted.
One is that he is the sec-
ond most powerful figure
in the American labor
movement.
Another is that he is a
devoted believer in gov-
ernment control of Amer-
ican industry.
Another is that he has
for 25 years been moving
to bring the Democratic
Party under the control of
the politically minded un-
ion leaders.
Another was that he had
the smartest, most acute
brain among all the polit-
ical labor leaders.
Now there is reason to
have grave doubts about
the last of these hitherto
conceded "facts." The na-
tionwide publicity which
has revealed Reuther's ob-
tuseness comes because it
has been brought out by a
person no less than the
President of the United
States. By now the whole
story is known over the
nation and it needs little
elaboration here.
But its importance
moves me to mention once
more in these articles the
issue of religion. More
than a month ago I wrote
that I should not bring it
up again, saying that the
subject should be avoided
by both candidates and by
all responsible political
writers.
I believed then that only
a few members of any re-
ligion would vote their
prejudices rather than
their concept of the worth
of the two candidates.
But Reuther is not a sin-
gle, irresponsible peddler
of fanaticism or even the
head of a small group of
fanatics. He is a public fig-
ure of great importance.
His voice and his influence
are known everywhere.
He serves on governmen-
tally appointed committees
and commissions. He lec-
tures in colleges and uni-
versities. He is listened to
because he speaks for
more than a million free
American wage earners—
members of all religions
and respected members of
their communities.

Granted that foolish and
irresponsible people have
attacked Kennedy because
of his religion. That has
been repudiated by Mr.
Nixon. But when a pam-
phlet which injects reli-
gion into the campaign is
inserted in the publication
of Walter Reuther's UAW
and distributed to mem-
bers who are of all faiths,
the issue of responsibility
is pertinent.
This scurrilous leaflet
was not limited to Detroit.
More than a million cop-
ies were distributed to
UAW members; addition-
al numbers were printed
and circulated by the
AFL-CIO's Committee for
Political Education.
Where does this leave
those Americans who are
not bigots but who op-
posed Kennedy legiti-
mately because of his in-
experience, his views on
foreign affairs, and his
economic radicalism?
★
Reuther's publica-
tion says in effect that
those who vote against
Kennedy are bigots and
enemies of liberty. I am
one of those Americans,
and I deeply resent this.
Thousands of others—
members of all religions—
will resent it also.
Reuther has compound-
ed his blunder by his
statement that the smear
has been "misrepresent-
ed." This is a weak and
disingenuous statement.
This publication of the
UAW cannot be misinter-
preted.
It is a summons to a
profoundly deep and cruel
division among our peo-
ple. It is also an irrepara-
ble injury to the labor
movement which Reuther
has exploited for political
purposes.
