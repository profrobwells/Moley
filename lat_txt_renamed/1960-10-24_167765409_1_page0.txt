Kennedy's Loose Talk on Fiscal
Policies Creates Crisis in Europe
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The loose talk by Sens.
Kennedy and Johnson
about spending and cutting
the interest rate has finally
created the crisis in Europe
which a great many people
have been predicting for
weeks.
For with some $20 bil-
lion of foreign investment
in the United States, a pan-
icky withdrawal from
abroad could have incalcu-
lable consequences in this
country. There is some-
thing in this international
situation similar to a run
on a bank which is caused
by talk about the institu-
tion's soundness.
For at least two or three
weeks, the evidences in Eu-
rope have been that the Eu-
ropean central banks have
actually been protecting
the American dollar. But
when fear gets into the air
in a free international so-
ciety, that protection can-
not last.

The impact in Europe of
talk about the economic
weakness of the United
States, plus a more careful
examination of what is in
the Democratic platform,
plus the failure of Kennedy
and Johnson to state what
their programs would cost,
caused uneasiness. But in
the past week reports—
probably politically in-
spired—that Kennedy is
likely to be elected have
turned uneasiness into
something approaching
panic.
Kennedy has asserted,
wholly without substantial
facts to prove his asser-
tions, that our economy is
going into a decline. His
supporters in the labor
newspapers have had
screaming headlines pre-
dicting a recession.
All this has impaired con-
fidence in the stability of
the dollar and, according
to reports from Europe,
has caused holders of dol-
lars to convert them into
gold. The result is a rise in
the European price of gold,
which in turn can cause an
outflow of gold from the
United States.

From the most unexpect-
ed sources there have been
warnings about the dangers
in the policies advocated by
the Democratic candidates
and their platform.
On last Thursday a state-
ment from Henry Wallace,
a retired survivor of the
crisis of 1933, appeared in
the news. He stated that
he is greatly worried about
the inflationary policies ad-
vocated by Kennedy-John-
son and the threat to cut
the interest rate. A month
ago, Wallace communicated
these worries to a member
of the Nixon staff.
International capitalism is
a very delicate mechanism.
For many years the Brit-
ish pound was master of
the world's markets. More
recently it has been the
American dollar. And now,
with the odds changing to
win the election. But to let
these charges stand might
bring incalculable conse-
quences to the American
economy and to all the free
nations.
Kennedy's numerous ref-
erences to the late Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt
recall certain pertinent
facts. Among all the quota-
tions from F. D. R. which
Kennedy has used, there is
a notable omission: "There
is nothing to fear but fear
itself." Possibly he will say
that now.
But this timing would be
bad. F. D. R. said that on
the day of his inaugura-
tion. He was then in a po-
sition to put that senti-
ment in action. What did
he do?
First, with the aid of
the Hoover holdovers in
the Treasury and the RFC,
he saved the banks. Next,
he called for a drastic cut
in government spending.
Both these measures were
immediately approved by
Congress.

But Kennedy has no
such way of showing that
he can restore the confi-
dence he has so seriously
impaired. He is just a can-
didate two weeks from
election day and nearly
three months from the day
he would be inaugurated
if elected President. If this
international loss of confi-
dence brings serious trou-
ble over here, with more
unemployment and all the
other possible conse-
quences, Kennedy has only
himself and his supporters
to blame.
