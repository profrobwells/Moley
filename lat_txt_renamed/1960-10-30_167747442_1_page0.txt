CONFIDENCE IN DOLLAR SHAKEN
Kennedy's Campaign Promises
Touch Off World Rush to Gold
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For no less than four
weeks, perceptive observ-
ers of international finance
have realized that the Ken-
nedy promises of vastly
greater spending for bene-
fits for interest groups of
all kinds and his threat to
the independence of the
Federal Reserve System
could cause an economic
disaster affecting every
American.
Some of those observers
are in the government of
the United States. They in-
clude Vice President Nix-
on. But the Treasury and
the President and the Vice
President felt that to bring
the subject into the cam-
paign might lead to still
more extreme proposals
from the opposition which
might make things worse.
*
That is why Nixon until
Monday night refrained
from using the subject in
his political speeches. He
dreaded causing panic in
American minds as it has
manifested itself in finan-
cial circles in Europe.
However, during the past
10 days the conversion of
dollars into gold in Europe
has steadily grown worse,
and finally, in Pittsburgh,
Nixon stated the situation
plainly to his audience.
Now the President has
added his warning about
irresponsible statements by
Kennedy and his support-
ers.
Perhaps the average
American, whose interests
have not made him ac-
quainted with internation-
al finance, may have be-
lieved that the preliminary
signs of panic in Europe
had little to do with his
own concerns. It was all a
matter for bankers and
brokers to worry about.
But it is vastly more than
that. It goes to the very
vitals of our life.
For to precipitate this
nation into a position in
which the American dollar
is no longer trusted is to
invite general distress.
There are several reasons
for this.
No American who has
savings or investments in
securities of the United
States needs to be remind-
ed of the effect upon him
of inflation through reck-
less government spending
and a slash in the rate of
interest on new issues.
That over here would
mean a flight from the dol-
lar into goods which
would greatly increase
prices of everything. It
would hit every small
manufacturer and trades-
man who must calculate
fairly in advance what he
must order and what
prices to charge.
But a gold panic is more
than that. It would mean
that our short-term liabili-
ties to foreigners (payable
in gold if European cen-
tral banks demand it)
would flow away and our
gold supply with them.
*
Already European in-
vestments here are greater
than our gold supply. Such
a withdrawal would put a
damper on industrial ex-
pansion and shut off the
supply of new jobs. No
spending on public works
by the federal government
through inflationary bor-
rowing could possibly
equalize that loss of jobs.
The small slowing down of
our economy which we
have now would be much
greater.
It requires only a read-
ing of the financial reports
in such responsible Euro-
pean papers as the Lon-
don Times and the Econo-
mist to see the reason for
this flight from the dollar
in Europe.
The London Times on
Oct. 21, the day after the
first wild jump in the
price of gold, had reports
from many financial cen-
ters in the world—London,
Paris, Toronto, Johannes-
burg and New York. All
told the same story. Ev-
erywhere people were
turning their dollars into
gold. Even Americans
were doing it.
The London Times’ re-
port from the United
States said, "The latest in-
crease in the price of gold
was related directly to the
changing sentiment about
the outcome of the Presi-
dential contest here. One
source quipped, ‘Wall
Street looked out of the
window yesterday and saw
a million persons cheering
Kennedy and put in an im-
mediate call to Zurich to
buy gold.’"
*
On Monday, the London
Times said editorially,
"Gold comes into its own
only when faith is lost in
currencies, and last week’s
furry was a culmination
of doubts about the Amer-
ican dollar."
To stop this fear, there
is only one thing Kennedy
can do. He cannot stop
this fear of his policies by
a mere quip or a promise
to balance the budget if
elected. Or to get greater
economic growth some-
where, sometime.
He must give specifica-
tions about how he can
give away all that he has
promised to interest
groups and still balance
the budget, prevent infla-
tion, and keep the dollar
sound. What will he use
for money? What new
taxes, and on whom? How
much would his program
cost?
Or he must repudiate
his platform, his previous
promises, and take back
his threat to the Federal
Reserve System. That is
his dilemma. For the dan-
ger to the dollar becomes
the major issue in this
campaign.
