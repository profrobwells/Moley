THE CITY GOES ITS OWN WAY

The Nation's Political Attitudes
Can't Be Judged by New York
At this stage, in fact at
any moment before the
votes are counted, it
would be rash to predict
the result of this election.
I always avoid predictions
as a matter of principle
and as a result of witness-
ing the mysterious ways
of the electorate over a
good many years.
But I am joined by a
completely impartial and
experienced commentator,
Roscoe Drummond, in a
belief that factors which
cannot be measured make
the result of this election
a mystery.
We are obviously a mi-
nority among political
commentators. But the sit-
uation in New York, espe-
cially in New York City,
which seems to favor Sen.
Kennedy's chances, lays a
heavy hand upon less ex-
perienced reporters and
upon the host of amateurs
who, after four years of
concern with everything
but politics, pop up in
Presidential elections as
seers and soothsayers.

My purpose in this ar-
ticle is to present the
unique character of New
York City and the reason
why opinion there cannot
be regarded as a national
trend. I have been a resi-
dent of New York during
half my life and have had
a somewhat unusual op-
portunity to understand
its ways and conditions.
Its capacity to influence,
rather than to create, opin-
ion over the nation is very
great. It is the nation's
major center for the dis-
semination of news. It is
the home of vastly impor-

tant publishing enter-
prises. It is the headquar-
ters of the big air net-
works. It is the nation's
financial center, which of
itself is a vast dissemina-
tor of news and opinion.
It is a major educational
center, and in the teach-
ing of teachers it is in
first place. Washington, the
capital, cannot match
these immense advan-
tages.

The atmosphere in New
York in which these opin-
ion-forming agencies oper-
ate is soggy with "liberal"
Democratic
prefer-
ences and with decidedly
left-wing thought. That is
true even in publications
which are headed by con-
servative individuals. For
the working press is
largely "liberal" or even
radical. After 27 years in
journalism I ought to
know that.
The population of New
York is, in enormous pro-
portions, favorable to an
extreme welfare federal
state. Tammany, in fact,
originated the concept of
winning votes by favors
from government. Every
district leader maintains a
small welfare state, with
voters bought by hand-
outs. The labor unions
which center here are in
the extreme left wing of
the labor movement.
The Republican organi-
zation in three of the four
boroughs lives off the
crumbs from the Demo-
cratic Party. This is be-
cause the Democratic or-
ganization must keep the
Republican organization
alive or it would itself split
up into several rival par-
ties. Republican leaders in
almost every Assembly
district are complacently
habituated to defeat and
are enjoying a sort of hap-
piness in being underdogs..
There are 700,000 immi-
grants from Puerto Rico
here who are managed and
controlled by politicians of
the late Vito Marcantonio.
Adam Clayton Powell,
congressman and minister
of the gospel, is practically
the dictator of Harlem's
vast population.
Among that part of the
population in the higher
brackets, what I have called
"Park Avenue Republican-
ism" prevails. From their
economically secure emi-
nence they like to be
known as "liberal." Nelson
Rockefeller is their idol,
and when he was running
for governor his views
varied in no important
respect from those of that
other inheritor of great
wealth, Averell Harriman.
*
In the once famous "silk
stocking" 17th District, the
Republican incumbent con-
gressman is talking exact-
ly the same language as his
Liberal - Democratic oppo-
nent. Gov. Rockefeller has
been making only a token
campaign for Nixon. Other
Republican candidates
never mention Nixon-
Lodge.
So I find it necessary in
every national campaign to
get out into the nation, and
in five months I have vis-
ited at least 15 states. New
York is no indication of a
national trend. It is spe-
cial, unique, and no meas-
ure of national opinion.
