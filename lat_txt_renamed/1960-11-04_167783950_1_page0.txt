Whoever wins, an old sol-
dier will retire to the quiet
life of an elder statesman
come January. But this
week he is fighting a fierce
battle for what he con-
ceives to be his country's
security and his own posi-
tion in history. Americans
might well take note of
this and consider the rea-
sons for his concern.
Eisenhower received his
commission in the Army
in 1915 and resigned in
1952. Except for four years
as president of Columbia
University, his entire life
was spent in the military
services.
When, with no little re-
luctance, he entered polit-
ical life in 1952, he was
laden with all the honors
which his military career
could have. It was, no
doubt, a difficult choice.
For he realized what haz-
ards he must face as Pres-
ident, how much unde-
served criticism he must
suffer, and how perilous it
would be to lose, like
Grant, much of the luster
of military success in a
verdict of history that he
had failed as a President.
He accepted that risk
with becoming humility
and devotion. He realized
before the first campaign
was over how little he
knew about the vicissi-
tudes of political life. Any
idea he might have har-
bored that, like Washing-
ton, he might be a Presi-
dent above party squab-
bles was immediately dis-
sipated by the opposition.
And slowly he learned the
ways of public but civilian
life.
While I had supported
Taft for the nomination, I
was glad to have the priv-
ilege of meeting and talk-
ing with Eisenhower in
August, 1952. The most
important thing I wanted
to know was his attitude
toward the issues which he
would face if he were
elected. These he dis-
cussed with utmost frank-
ness.
They need not be recited
here, but I learned also
something about the man
himself and his capacity to
bear the responsibility of
the Presidency without
losing his essential humili-
ty. For so many in that
high office, surrounded as
they are by people who
want something, have
come to the point at which
their modesty is over-
whelmed by their impor-
tance as Chief Executive.
Dwight Eisenhower has
survived that test, perhaps
better than any President
since Lincoln.
As anyone except a bit-
ter partisan knows, Presi-
dent Eisenhower has given
everything he has in la-
bor, devotion and sincerity
to the maintenance of sta-
ble government at home
and resistance to commu-
nism abroad. He himself
has read the record on
both scores.
Surely there have been
mistakes. The man whom
Kennedy mentions on all
occasions, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, once said,
"Presidents do make mis-
takes." But as Thomas
Carlyle said, "Granted, the
ship comes into harbor
with shrouds and tackle
damaged; the pilot is
blameworthy; he has not
been all wise and all pow-
erful: But to know how
blameworthy, tell us first
whether his voyage has
been round the globe or
only to Ramsgate and the
Isle of Dogs."
This mariner's prob-
lems were world-wide.
There was war in 1953,
and communism was on
the march everywhere.
With the Korean conflict
ended, a vastly smaller
number of the world's
population has been lost
to communism than in the
six years before 1953.
The economy has had
its hesitations—it always
has to be that way in a
free society — but the
trend has been sensation-
ally upward.
Despite the absurd
charge of Kennedy that
the civilian services have
been neglected by the fed-
eral government, the Ei-
senhower budgets have
kept inflation to a mini-
mum and have increased
the civilian expenditures
by more than 100%.
This record is on the
line now. It has been mis-
represented, sneered at,
and defiled in this cam-
paign. It is small wonder
that the President this
week is determined to set
the record straight. His in-
dignation is understand-
able and it is justified.
