Expense Account Tax Deductions
Due for a Much-Needed Reform
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sometime during the
next year many business
executives will find them-
selves living lower on the
hog. Salesmen and others
in the great advertising
industry will find them-
selves sitting on high
stools for lunch rather
than lounging in plushy
restaurants. Probably
there will be fewer gour-
mets and better salesmen.
And sales and deals will
be conducted in the more
prosaic surroundings of
offices rather than at lunch
or dinner or in cocktail
bars.
For it is almost certain
that one of the pledges of
the Democratic platform
will be kept. That is to cut
down tax deductions for
business entertainment.

The Kennedy adminis-
tration, despite conserva-
tive opposition to big
spending, will certainly
need additional billions.
This entertainment item is
a spot where the feathers
can be plucked with a min-
imum of pain except to the
minority concerned.
Last June the Senate
passed a bill which would
have practically eliminated
expense account deduc-
tions. The section con-
cerned was removed in a
Senate-House conference
committee. But with this
agreement it was decided
to ask the Secretary of the
Treasury to report to Con-
gress the results of the en-
forcement program of the
Internal Revenue Service.
It also was agreed that
the joint committee of in-
ternal revenue taxation
should make a complete
study of the problem. That
committee will make its
report to Congress early
next year. Commissioner
of Internal Revenue Dana
Latham has promised to
make his report and to do
all he can to tighten the
regulations without addi-
tional legislation.

But it may well be that
he will be replaced by a
Kennedy appointee who
will certainly be intent
upon closing every loop-
hole and thus getting more
revenue without addition-
al taxes.
I shall win few friends
in the business community
by saying that there is
definite need for reform in
this area. However, I
have been in the publish-
ing business for 27 years
and have seen a good deal
of Madison Ave. advertis-
ing circles and feel that
the entertainment aspects
have been grossly over-
done. To restrict them
would be good for busi-
ness, a small relief to tax-
payers, and most benefi-
cial for the individuals
concerned.

There are those who
have gone to their graves
from the effect of the din-
ing and wine attendant up-
on selling advertising.
Thousands of businessmen
in all lines are reduced to
a quarter of their efficien-
cy in afternoons after
sumptuous lunches pre-
ceded by many cocktails.
It is curious that in New
York the bankers down-
town mostly forgo drink-
ing at lunch, but that is
not true of Madison Ave.
I have discussed this
subject with many who are
caught in this custom, and
their reply is that, while
they regret it, the nature
of the competition de-
mands that much of their
dealing and selling be re-
served for the luncheon
hour. The clients expect it
of the salesmen, and so it
goes.
There are also the lavish
meetings of the higher-ups
in business at conventions
and the like, usually at
very costly hotels and re-
sorts. Golf club member-
ships are largely rated as
business expenses, and
they may include not only
the entertainment of the
principal, but of his wife
and family. There are also
other and more ostenta-
tious examples of conspic-
uous waste charged off in
tax returns, such as pow-
er boats, hotel suites, and
other extravagances.

A dose of austerity
would mean more efficient
business administration,
longer lives for partici-
pants, and more revenue
for the government. Of
course, the major reason
for all this is the excessive-
ly high taxes levied upon
corporations.
But there is little chance
to change that now. It
might be, as one unwilling
victim of expense-account
excesses said, that the
heads of competitive busi-
ness should get together
for some sort of self-regu-
lation. Perhaps this is not
practical, but unless it is
done, government is cer-
tain to impose drastic re-
strictions.
