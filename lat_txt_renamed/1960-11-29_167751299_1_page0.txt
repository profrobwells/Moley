RAYMOND MOLEY:
Reflections on 1960
Farm State Voting
Two weeks before the
election I had a long talk
in Chicago with Harry
Homewood, an experi-
enced and perceptive re-
porter whose responsibil-
ity is to travel continu-
ously in Illinois and the
adjoining farm states. At
my suggestion he has writ-
ten his reflections on what
happened there in the re-
cent election. I am present-
ing them here as he has
written them:
"As the race for the
Presidency came down to
the finish, the two candi-
dates spent several days
in the great reaches of the
farm country where the
earth lay quietly with the
knowing silence of work
well done.
★
"In Wisconsin the cam-
paign trails ran alongside
fields of cabbages; blowsy
and without symmetry,
the outer leaves bug-rid-
dled and lopping, touched
with the brown softness of
early frost, awaiting the
picking and the kraut fac-
tory. In Illinois the police
sirens accompanying the
candidates screamed past
the corn fields with the
stalks drying and the ears
heavy in the fraying
husks. In the small towns
the quick stops were long
enough to afford a smell
of crushed apples in the
cider presses and the pun-
gency of burning leaves.
Across the Midwest the
shadows of campaign air-
craft fled over the stagger-
ing harvest of the wheat
fields.
"Everywhere the candi-
dates saw the storage
bins, unnumbered num-
bers in groups stark
against the cleansed fields.
Bins straining against
hammered rivets with the
incredible harvest of the
soil. Grim reminders of a
glut growing with the
years.
"For this rich soil has
been cozened and coaxed
to yield far more than the
market can bear. This land
has been scientifically
taught to be wanton and
free. And this land — and
the farmers who find it so
fruitful — are basic sym-
bols of the political temper
of the farmer himself as
he contemplates the com-
ing of the first Democrat-
ic administration in eight
years.
"These farmers are an
educated, informed, expe-
rienced, thoughtful people.
They are for the most part
well versed in economic
facts and competent in the
arts of management. They
know considerable history
from experience and read-
ing. Their intellectual ho-
rizons have been widened
over the past few years
with more access to the
news of the nation and the
world. Granted that they
have been deluded in the
past. Deluded by populist
allurements of easy mon-
ey through free silver and
greenbacks. But they know
now that inflation cuts
with a two-edged blade.
They get more for what
they sell, but they pay
still more for what they
buy.
"They have acquired po-
litical sophistication from
experience with slick poli-
ticians who have sought
their votes. And they
know now that the gods
they once were constrained
to worship were silver-
plated idols and that the
father government they
were told to revere was a
tyrant under his smiles.
★
"Despite the vicissitudes
and their sorrows and dis-
illusionment, they have re-
mained underneath rugged
sons of a tradition of indi-
vidualism.
"This year they were not
confused. They knew that
neither party had the an-
swer to the almost unbear-
able burden of abundance.
"They saw that despite
gobbledygook the Demo-
cratic farm 'program'
ment more, not less, gov-
ernment — strict controls
and rigid, inflexible rules
— a new enlargement of
the already oppressive con-
striction of their area of
free choice.
"The Republican pro-
posals, vague in detail,
meant in essence to lessen
the weight of govern-
ment in their business.
Not 'no government,' but
'less government.'
"And so they took their
stand on ground short of
the point of no return.
They voted for 'less gov-
ernment.'"
