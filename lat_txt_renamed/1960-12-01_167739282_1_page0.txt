RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Religious Issue
in Wisconsin Voting
It is a solid political
fact which has been shown
over and over that when
no other choices are pres-
ent, voters are likely to
turn to their religious or
racial loyalties.
Remove parties as a co-
hesive force, and other
factors, which are quite
irrelevant to political af-
fairs, draw the interest of
voters.
In Wisconsin, when
Sens. Kennedy and Hum-
phrey were contesting in
the primary campaign,
there was no choice of par-
ty or of real issues. Both
candidates were commit-
ted to substantially the
same national programs.
Both had almost identical
voting records in Congress.
Hence, religion played a
large part in the result.
The following are some
evidences that in the re-
cent Presidential election,
when there was an issue
of party and ideology in
the choice between Ken-
nedy and Nixon, the re-
ligious the was not nearly
so significant.

The 2nd Congressional
District centers in Madi-
son and Dane Counties.
This is called the "egg-
head district." Normally,
it votes Democratic. In
1958 there was a strong
protest against the Benson
farm program, and the
Democratic candidate for
governor carried the dis-
trict with 55.4% of the
vote.
In the 1960 primary
Humphrey carried the dis-
trict with 53.2% of the
vote. But with Kennedy
campaigning as a "liberal"
against Nixon, the result
was different. Kennedy
took Dane County with
only a slight majority.
The Sth Congressional
District was the home of
Sen. McCarthy. It is heav-
ily Catholic, by some 47%
of its population. During
the primary campaign,
Humphrey rarely went
into the district. He con-
ceded it to Kennedy be-
cause of its Catholic popu-
lation.
Kennedy carried it with
71% of the vote. He won
in every one of the nine
counties. In the recent
election, Nixon won six of
the nine counties and car-
ried the district.
In the primary, the 9th
Congressional District was
carried by Humphrey with
55.6% of the vote. The
district is predominantly
Protestant. In the recent
election the voters turned
to Nixon and gave him
54.6% of the vote.
In the Presidential race,
Kennedy campaigned vig-
orously in these districts
and in the state as a whole.
The state saw nothing of
Nixon in the spring cam-
paigning and only a little
during the final days of
the Presidential cam-
paign. But despite all of
Kennedy's efforts, he was
rejected.
â˜…
There is evidence here
that while religion might
have played a part, with a
clear choice of parties and
of candidates with differ-
ent ideologies, voters re-
turned to their conserva-
tive loyalties and to the
issues presented by Nixon.
There are those conserv-
atives, who are wise after
the event, who believe that
Nixon did not stress con-
servatism strongly enough.
But in this state, in which
the people are highly edu-
cated and well versed in
political issues, Nixon of-
fered a real alternative to
Kennedy's "liberalism."
In short, when the chips
were down, the voters
looked at the issues. Those
issues were blurred when
the choice was between
Kennedy and Humphrey.
In fact, they were both
running on the same issues
-farm, labor and welfare.
This is a wholesome sign
that the way to lessen the
influence of religious loy-
alties in elections is to
present real differences in
the subjects that count or
should count in politics.
There is no other way to
deal with a dangerous
and undesirable factor in
politics.
