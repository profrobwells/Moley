A MORAL LAW DEFENDED
The Responsibility of Children
for Parents in Need Is Upheld
An indeterminate num-
ber of conservative voters
denied their support of
Nixon because of his re-
puted closeness to Secre-
tary Flemming of the De-
partment of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare.
This was because of the
secretary's indiscriminate
employment and support
of many individuals in the
Office of Education and
the Social Security Admin-
istration with extremely
radical and visionary no-
tions about the meaning of
welfare and the govern-
ment's responsibility for
obligations hitherto re-
garded as strictly within
the province of the indi-
vidual and the local com-
munity.

Proof of this secretarial
naivete has now appeared
in a booklet published by
the Social Security Ad-
ministration entitled, "Fil-
ial Responsibility in the
Modern American Fam-
ily." It sells for 25 cents,
and for that small sum
children may get the lat-
est fancy reasons why they
owe nothing to their par-
ents.
This publication holds
the thesis that 35 states
have been wrong in requir-
ing children able to do so
to contribute to the sup-
port of their needy par-
ents.
The ideal of legislation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
is that it should embody
the moral law generally re-
garded as binding on all
civilized individuals. The
legislation in those 35
states, it would seem, em-
bodies one of the first prin-
ciples of human lifeâ€”the
principle that the family is
the basic unit in civiliza-
tion.
The booklet just issued
was prepared by one Alvin
L. Schorr, a "family life
specialist" in the Social
Security Administration.
His argument, which is
buttressed by many of the
writings of "do-gooders"
in the vague fields of so-
ciology, geriatrics, and so-
cial welfare, agrees in prin-
ciple with the report of a
Senate subcommittee
which declared in sub-
stance that, because so
many parents now live to
an advanced age, they can-
not be expected to remain
"a part of their younger
relatives' family."
*
This shocking conclu-
sion, stated plainly, is that
the older and more needy
a parent, the less his chil-
dren should regard him or
her as a relative. I have
had to read and reread this
utter perversion of moral-
ity to believe that it was a
responsible government
which had issued it. And
now comes Mr. Schorr,
echoing the idea.
It should be said that
when that Senate subcom-
mittee made its report,
Sens. Dirksen and Goldwa-
ter vehemently denounced
it.
Sociological bureaucrats
such as Schorr point out
that it is not always easy
to enforce through legisla-
tion the filial obligation
upon children who refuse
to assume it. Therefore,
they believe it to be the
easiest way to forget all
about moral obligations
and to tap what they con-
ceive to be the illimitable
revenues of the federal
government.

In this column I have on
more than one occasion
made the point that while
the direct support of aged
and needy parents may be
difficult for children, it
would be quite possible to
provide a tax deduction
for those who purchased
health insurance for their
parents.
This would be one of
several steps ignored in
both the Kennedy propo-
sals and the bill, now law,
which was sponsored by
the administration in the
last session of Congress.
It would make the bur-
den less for children grow-
ing up with families of
their own, but still re-
mind them of their moral
obligation.
