MACHINES CAN'T THINK
The Record of Vote Computers
Reaffirms Man's Individuality
Considering the record
of the electronic computers
in the hours following the
November election, the
broadcasting companies
and the manufacturers of
the machines should limit
their ambitions on future
occasions.
They did not contribute
to the public welfare, nor
did they add to public con-
fidence in these devices by
what they projected and
by the interpretations the
many commentators drew
from the computations.

Certain basic facts about
political behavior were
either unknown to those
who introduced these de-
vices into their reporting
of returns, or they were
ignored.
To an experienced stu-
dent of politics, election
returns in the early hours
mean little. What is mean-
ingful is where the figures
come from. Are they from
suburbs which tradition-
ally have voted Republi-
can? Or from a city ward
where Democrats have al-
ways been overwhelming-
ly in the majority?
In the haste to show
that computers could tear
the veil of the future, the
broadcasting from the ma-
chines obscured the main
news of the night—that it
was a close election.
I have before me the
complete record of what
ABC, CBS and NBC com-
puters predicted at all the
hours after the returns be-
gan to come in on Election
Night. ABC used the great-
est restraint in giving
"odds," and CBS more
than NBC. But all were in

varying degrees prema-
ture, and at varying times
ridiculously wrong.
ABC'S UNIVAC gave
odds of 10 to 1 on the elec-
tion of Nixon at 7:00 p.m.
EST) and then apparent-
ly refrained until 8:44,
when it shifted to 7 to 5
for Kennedy. The IBM
computer of CBS opened
by twice announcing a
trend to Nixon that would
bring him 459 electoral
votes.
The following is the rec-
ord of predictions of
RCA's 501 computer,
broadcast by NBC. A rep-
resentative of the network
has since claimed that
they were "projecting,"
not "predicting." That is a
distinction without an es-
sential difference.
NBC at 8:23 p.m. pre-
dicted Kennedy at odds of
6.3 to 1. Ten minutes later,
the computer shifted to 3
to 1 Kennedy. Two min-
utes later, 7 to 1. Its Ken-
nedy odds shifted by hours
and minutes: from 22 to 1,
to 15 to 1, to 25 to 1, to
332.3 to 1, back to 250 to 1,
and then to 333 to 1—the
announcer adding, "It
might be higher, but that
is as far as the machine
goes."
*
This singular admission
of the limits of the ma-
chine is rather startling.
But since that is all the
machine could do, NBC
had to be content with
333-to-1 odds for half an
hour, when suddenly there
was a change to 90 to 1,
then down to 6½ to 1 at
11:45 p.m.
But within minutes,
back to 333 to 1, where the
odds remained. Meanwhile,
the computer had, among
other things, given 52%
of the popular vote to
Kennedy and 48% to Nix-
on and had posted 400
electoral votes for Ken-
nedy.
And so, far into the
morning hours, when
Messrs. Huntley and
Brinkley were bleary-eyed
and flagging, the erratic
course continued. In ex-
amining the "projections"
of specific states we see
some curious figures. (It
should be noted that 3-to-1
odds were considered a
"certainty.")
★
At 3:45 a.m. the machine
said Kennedy had a 10-to-1
chance to carry California.
At 4:35: "Nixon will win
Illinois." Five minutes
later, New Mexico was for
Nixon, 4 to 1 odds.
Illinois was said to be
for Nixon at 6:29 that
morning, by 3-to-1 odds. At
7:16, the computer report-
ed California was for Ken-
nedy, odds at 9 to 1, and
three minutes later Cali-
fornia was awarded to
Kennedy by NBC's "vic-
tory desk."
It was curious that a
reliable news disseminat-
ing agency resorted to the
practices of horse racing
or prize fighting by this
strange manner of quoting
varying "odds" at varying
times.
Man continues to be a
mysterious, unpredictable
creature. And I hope he
continues to be. For to
assume that he is a help-
less atom, without a soul
and a mind and passions,
is to accept black mate-
rialism as his lot and his
destiny.
