WILL PROBE U.S. AGENCIES
James M. Landis Has Had a Long
Association With the Kennedys
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since James M. Landis
now appears in the news
as the man selected by
Sen. Kennedy to investi-
gate the federal commis-
sions and agencies which
regulate business, a bit of
past history should be in-
teresting.
This is not to raise any
question of the suitability
of Landis for that task,
but merely to recite the
circumstances under
which his close relations
with the Kennedy family
came about.
In 1933, Sam Rayburn,
then chairman of the
House Committee on In-
terstate Commerce, accept-
ed from Felix Frankfurter
two draftsmen to draw up
a bill to regulate the se-
curities market.
★
These were Landis and
Benjamin V. Cohen, both
proteges of Frankfurter.
The bill as drafted and
passed proved so rigid
that investment was seri-
ously checked at a mo-
ment when recovery from
the depression was of vi-
tal importance.
Roosevelt recognized
this defect and decided
that the bill should be
liberalized in the 1934 ses-
sion of Congress. This was
accomplished by the en-
actment of a new bill
which created the Secu-
rities and Exchange Com-
mision.
The 1933 bill had been
administered by the Fed-
eral Trade Commission, to
which the President had
appointed Landis.
The first step after Con-
gress adjourned in 1934
was the appointment of
members of the new SEC.
Since I had acted as liai-
son between the President
and Rayburn in the House
and James F. Byrnes in
the Senate in getting the
new bill passed, Roosevelt
asked me for a list of suit-
able men for appointment.
That list, which I have
now, contained eight
names, to which I added
verbally that of Ferdinand
Pecora, who had been
counsel for Sen. Fletcher's
sensational investigation
of investment banking
two years earlier.
★
The list also included
the names of Joseph P.
Kennedy and Landis. I had
included Kennedy despite
the violent objections of
Louis Howe, the Presi-
dent's long-time secretary
and counselor. The rumors
of Kennedy's possible ap-
pointment had also stirred
up violent opposition in
some sections of the press.
However, I included the
Kennedy name for two
reasons: one, because he
had ardently supported
Roosevelt when he was a
candidate for the nomina-
tion in 1932, and also be-
cause he knew so much
about the financial mar-
kets.
In making the selection
from the nine names,
Roosevelt picked five, in-
cluding Kennedy, Landis
and Pecora. As soon as
they knew they were to
be appointed, there was
great rivalry for the chair-
manship between Landis
and Pecora.
The former was the fa-
vorite of the Frankfurter
proteges, and Pecora had
support in the Senate. But
obviously Kennedy was
preferable because of his
knowledge of business and
his administrative capaci-
ty.
On the day of the se-
lection, Kennedy and Ber-
nard Baruch were brought
to the President's office.
I was also there. The
President indicated his
choices—Kennedy for
the five-year appointment,
Landis for three, and Pe-
cora for one year. The
President also said he
wanted Kennedy for chair-
man and instructed me to
tell Landis to nominate
him at the first meeting
of the commission.
I did so, but Landis,
unhappy at the frustra-
tion of his own ambition,
refused to nominate Ken-
nedy unless he had it in
writing from the Presi-
dent. Naturally, I was not
so happy at this demand. And
so I said I would get it in
writing and have Kennedy
himself bring it to the
meeting so that the order
would really be carried
out. I got a note signed by
the President and gave it
to Kennedy, and he was
elected.
★
The association of Lan-
dis and Kennedy was ap-
parently pleasant enough,
and two years later, after
Kennedy had organized
the commission, Landis
got the chairmanship. In
recent years Landis has
served the elder Kennedy
as legal counsel. And so
Landis becomes the reor-
ganizer for all the federal
commissions for Kennedy
the younger.
