Kennedy's Troubles
in Choosing Cabinet
The difficulties' of Sen.
Kennedy in getting to-
gether a fairly competent
and respect-inspiring Cabi-
net suggest the problems
of Clement Attlee when,
in 1945, he was surprised
to find dumped in his lap
the responsibility of oper-
ating a government.
Looking around him, he
found his Labor Party
rich in agitators, theorists,
trade-union politicians,
second-rate novelists, and
pamphleteers and social
workers. But the genuine
administrative talent—
men and women accus-
tomed to handling large-
scale administrative opera-
tions—were all in the Con-
servative Party.

The dismal failure of
this experiment in social-
ism in the six years that
followed was as much due
to the bungled administra-
tion of plain, everyday
chores of executing laws
as to the nature of the new
laws themselves.
And when the Attlee
government attempted to
take over great industries
and run them, the farce of
it penetrated even the
somewhat insensitive Brit-
ish sense of humor but
finally, after six years of
administrative comedy,
the voters pitched out the
whole crowd of rabble-
rousers and do-gooders
and hired a government
with administrative tal-
ent.
One example was the
job of getting enough food
into the British Isles to
feed the people. The lugu-
brious scribblings of Karl
Marx could not fill an emp-
ty belly. Marx had been so
inept that apparently he
could not find a good bar-
ber.

But Attlee picked as
food minister one John
Strachey, whose labors had
hitherto been devoted to
writing books predicting
the demise of capitalism.
Strachey was a bold in-
novator. So he squandered
a lot of money in East
Africa trying to raise pea-
nuts on dry land and
chickens in a West African
jungle.
And so, after five years
of this, when I was in Eng-
land, about the only
edibles were soup and
buns. There were also fish
and chips.
During the war, when
the problem of food was
much more acute than aft-
er 1945, Churchill reached
into the business world
for a man to take over the
Food Ministry. He se-
cured Lord Woolton,
whose life had been spent
in retail merchandising.
His operation was highly
successful.

Sen. Kennedy finds that
while his party is rich in
spellbinders, professorial
politicians, political bosses,
and minority agitators,
there are precious few who
have ever had to manu-
facture goods, run a big
employment operation,
and meet payrolls out of
profits.
Two governors who
know something about ad-
ministration, Messrs. Ribi-
coff and Hodges, about
exhausted the supply of
governors. Anybody can
serve as secretary of com-
merce, as did even Dan
Roper and Harry Hopkins.
To run the vast Interior
Department, with tens of
thousands of employees,
Kennedy fell back upon a
man named Udall who had
apparently never operat-
ed anything but a short-
lived law practice and sev-
eral campaigns for Con-
gress.

The Eisenhower choices
for the Cabinet posts have,
with a few exceptions,
commanded respect. His
two secretaries of the
treasury were able men in
their own right. Dulles
was a fine secretary of
state. The other Cabinet
members have been aver-
age to good.
This contrast between
conservative and left-wing
parties presents a real
threat to free institutions.
The "liberals" seek a con-
stantly bigger government,
but their capacity to oper-
ate it decreases as it
grows. Perhaps once more
in this generation, as in the
many centuries in the
past, democracy will die
of its own incompetence.
