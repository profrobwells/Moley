Dean Rusk has made a
great deal of sense about
"summitry" in the opin-
ions he expressed even
before the lamented meet-
ing in Paris broke up last
May. The attitude of Sen.
Kennedy in the cam-
paign could not be clearly
defined. That gives the
hope that the views of his
secretary of state will pre-
vail.
Perhaps the willingness
of President Eisenhower
to participate in summit
meetings was due to sev-
eral factors. In the first
place the President's utter
striving for peaceful solu-
tions made him agreeable
to any possible sort of ef-
fort.
Also, as commander of
our military forces in Eu-
rope in the war, he was
quite accustomed to deal-
ing with other command-
ers and heads of states.
In those days he was a re-
markable conciliator of
clashing opinions among
the allies.
But a determining fac-
tor of great importance in
the last eight years has
been the tremendous pres-
sure for such meetings by
the British. It was, I be-
lieve, the British who in-
vented the word "summit-
ry." It has a public appeal
over there almost like the
zeal of the Middle Ages
for crusades. Kings and
princes in those days re-
garded the capture of Je-
rusalem as vastly more
important than running
their own realms.
I was in England in
May, 1955, during the gen-
eral election. The Con-
servative government at
the time, with Sir Antho-
ny Eden at its head, strove
in every possible way to
get President Eisenhower
to agree to an early sum-
mit meeting.
His agreement during
the campaign was greeted
with loud hosannas. It
sealed the fate of the
kindly Mr. Attlee and his
Labor Party.
I noticed the same ap-
peal in the campaign over
there in 1959. They had
their summits, all right,
with results that, while
unproductive, have not
chilled their belief in
such meetings.
But there is a great dif-
ference between a British
prime minister's running
about and such an exer-
cise by the President of
the United States.
To begin with, the prime
minister is not the head
of the state. The king or
queen occupies that po-
sition, at least nominally.
The distances to meet-
ing places are shorter.
Prime ministers are gen-
erally more skilled in the
give and take of debate
and negotiation, since they
have been trained in
Parliament. Very few
American Presidents have
had that personal capacity.
Imagine Benjamin Harri-
son trying to cope with
the wily Gladstone, or
Gen. Grant with Disraeli!
Most will agree that it
was a mistake for Wilson
to go to Versailles to deal
with the cynical and
tricky Clemenceau and
Lloyd George.
Since both Churchill
and Franklin D. Roosevelt
loved the spectacular, they
made the most of their
meetings. It was like Hen-
ry VIII and Francis I at
the Field of the Cloth of
Gold. But Stalin got the
gold, and they got the
glory-such as it was.
There is great authority
in a negotiator who can
always say that his agree-
ments are, as they say in
diplomacy, ad referendum.
That means that the boss
in Washington may or
may not agree. The final
judge is far from the
scene. He has time to
think in the White House.
He cannot think clearly
when every evening is
spent in feasting at state
dinners, with innumerable
toasts.
The secretary of state is
continually briefed. That is
routine. But when the
President goes to the sum-
mit, he must be given a
cram course. His interests
and responsibilities as
President have been in in-
numerable subjects other
than foreign affairs.
Finally, if he trusts his
secretary of state, as he
should since he has ap-
pointed him, he can de-
mand that the heads of
other states place a like
trust in their representa-
tives.
Summits have color and
vast public interest. But
real negotiations by expert
representatives of govern-
ments can take the time
and drudgery to reach real
results-if there are re-
sults to be attained.
