Communist Dogma
Brings Crop Failures
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
"Don't tell me about
pigs," Khrushchev
boomed when he was in
Iowa in 1959. "I know all
about pigs and all about
farming. I am a man of
the soil."
He is, indeed, an earthy
man, at home in the por-
cine world. But it is be-
ginning to appear that he
doesn't know all about
farming. And that lack of
knowledge is beginning to
cause unhappy rumblings
in his new frontier.
The major trouble is in
the great regions strad-
dling the border between
Asia and Europe. One of
those regions is the Ka-
zakh Soviet Socialist Re-
public. It is now revealed
that the grain crop there
is 3 million tons short of
expectations.
The Kazakh is an area
one-third as large as the
United States. It consists
of dry steppes and runs
from the 50th parallel of
latitude on the north to
south of the 40th parallel.
It borders on European
Russia and the Caspian
Sea on the west, touches
Iran and Afghanistan on
the south, and extends to
China on the east.. It is as
large as a section which
would include the north-
ern third of Missouri, all
of Iowa, Nebraska, the Da-
kotas, Minnesota, and on
into Canada as far as Win-
nipeg.
The Kazakh is a vast
livestock region. The
problems faced by Khru-
shchev there are exactly
the same as those that
faced our own farmers in
the 1930s. One cannot
break the sod on the great
prairies where rainfall is
light and hope to keep the
land in production.
*
For a while, as long as
the rich humus of the
prairie sod holds the mois-
ture, the land will give
forth. But once the mois-
ture has been exhausted,
the soil takes flight with
the winds. That is what
has happened in the Ka-
zakh.
The Soviet mentality,
firmly holding the dogma
that the state knows best,
cannot comprehend the
fact that the land must be
cozened and nursed like
an infant. And the one
who can do that best is
the man who lives with
it and depends upon it for
his livelihood. The state
can help him, but he must
be free to experiment.
Under the iron rules of
communism, if the land re-
fuses to produce, it must
be starved. And the land,
Khrushchev
like the peasant, must
work or starve. But the
land, unlike a man, recog-
nizes no incentive. To
deny it fertilizer and
chemicals is to reduce it
to impotence. To the Com-
munist bureaucrat, land is
either fertile or barren.
The American farmer,
in an atmosphere of free-
dom, realizes that the land
has a potential which in-
genuity can develop. In
our great plains farmers
found, after trial and er-
ror and tribulation, that if
strips of land are left fal-
low between strips of
grain, there will be
enough moisture retained
from the slim rainfall to
raise grain and also to
keep the soil from blow-
ing away.
And from what this or
that farmer learned by his
experiments, the govern-
ment was able to inform
many other farmers. But
the knowledge had to
come from what free
farmers knew.
But in Russia there is
what so many fatuous
economists tried without
success to foist upon the
early Roosevelt adminis-
tration â€” central govern-
ment economic planning.
In Russia almost half
the labor force of the
country is struggling to
feed only Russia. Over
here, only 10% of our pop-
ulation is engaged in farm-
ing, and our production is
far beyond our needs and
must flow out to the rest
of the world.
