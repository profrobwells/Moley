'Mr. Sam' Runs Risk
of 'Uncle Joe's' Fate
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The packing of the
Rules Committee, so nar-
rowly voted, may well
have ominous and far-
reaching results. And no
one should know that bet-
ter than the venerable
speaker himself.
The action of the House
in elevating the speaker to
a position of almost dicta-
torial power recalls the life
and times of another
speaker in another day, Jo-
seph Gurney Cannon. The
tenures of Cannon and
Rayburn laid end to end
encompass 88 years of the
life of the republic—four
years more than half.
Cannon first entered the
House in 1873 and, with
occasional missed terms,
served until the 1920s. By
the time he retired, laden
with years, Rayburn had
been there six terms. They
knew and respected each
other.

Before March, 1910,
"Uncle Joe" Cannon had
been speaker and also
chairman of the Rules
Committee. Then, as in the
immediate past, the Rules
Committee was the means
by which measures ap-
proved by other commit-
tees were brought to a
vote.
Cannon not only was
chairman of the Rules
Committee, but he had the
authority to appoint com-
mittee members. As speak-
er, Cannon dominated the
House. A member could
not get the floor without
Cannon's permission, and
Cannon saw to it that all
committees were dominat-
ed by members whom he
approved.
It is of immediate inter-
est now to note that dur-
ing that period of Can-
non's dictatorship the ar-
gument for this tight sys-
tem of control was that
the Republican Party had
the right, since it had a
mandate from the people,
to facilitate legislation in
harmony with its purposes
and to frustrate legisla-
tion which was not in har-
mony with Republican pol-
icy. That is what the "lib-
erals" are saying now,
about Democratic policy.
But since Cannon had
taken this vast responsi-
bility, he was also made
the target for violent crit-
icism.
In March, 1910, a few
"progressive" Republicans
joined with the Democrat-
ic members and engi-
neered a revolution. Can-
non was taken off the
Rules Committee, and
committee members were
to be elected by the
House.
The Rules Committee
was "enlarged" (packed),
just as it was last week.
Speaker Cannon
Cannon was kept as speak-
er until the end of the ses-
sion, but since the Demo-
crats won the House in
1910, a Democratic speak-
er succeeded him in 1911.
The sober judgment of a
great historian, Charles A.
Beard, has been that the
change made no real dif-
ference in the manage-
ment of business. For the
House, because of its size,
must have order in han-
dling legislation.

But the lesson Rayburn
should learn from the Can-
non history is that now
that he has ascended to the
throne from which Cannon
was pushed in 1910, he,
too, will be the symbol of
reaction if all that an ener-
getic President and his
merry men want passed is
not passed as they dictate.
It will be a pity if the
amiable "Mr. Sam," who
has gotten along so well
by being friends with ev-
eryone over all these many
years, should become the
target of attack by both
unhappy "liberals" and
the solid conservatives
who voted against the
Rules Committee enlarge-
ment.
But Rayburn, knowing
the Cannon history, "asked
for it." He has already des-
ignated the new members
of the Rules Committee
and is pledged to put
through the President's
program. And if that pro-
gram is not passed, it will
be Rayburn who will be
the "goat" of the New
Frontier.
