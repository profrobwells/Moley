The State of the Union: Who Is
Right, Kennedy or Eisenhower?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There was, it is said, a
doctor in Washington who
had an enormous and prof-
itable practice. A young
man just ending his in-
ternship asked him the se-
cret of his success. The
answer was, "I scare them
into fits, and then I spe-
cialize.. curing fits."
If things were fairly
normal and an administra-
tion doing a good job, in
keeping them so, no elec-
torate would be disposed
to make a change. And so
an opposition must con-
vince voters that things
are not normal and that
the government is indif-
ferent to taking remedial
action.
This is where the art of
persuasion comes in. Ap-
parently a relatively few
thousand more believed in
the dark side, and the
Kennedy-Johnson ticket is
in office.
And so, in order to pre-
pare the way for radical
action by government in
administering restoratives,
the dark picture was pre-
sented by the newly in-
augurated President. If
what President Kennedy
said is true, we are indeed
in a state of emergency.
But an equally truthful
and certainly a better in-
formed man, the former
President, has said that
we are not in such a bad
state.
Here is an issue. And
who is to resolve it?
Since the United States
is well equipped with eco-
nomic experts and seers,
it might be suggested that
a hundred or so of that
elite be brought together
to do an exhaustive check-
up on our economy.
But if such a convoca-
tion should be held, the
individuals therein would
terminate their delibera-
tions in a fist fight. The
scene would be cluttered
with cracked noggins,
mixed metaphors, and split
infinitives.
There would be violent
differences among the
combatants as to the facts;
but if there could be agree-
ment on the facts, there
would be equally bitter
differences as to what
should be done.
Even those economists
who are generally on the
side of the administration
in power cannot agree. Dr.
Keyserling and Dr. Gal-
braith disagree. There are
those reformers who be-
lieve in national planning.
In the Kennedy portray-
al of deplorable conditions
now, he is at a disadvan-
tage when compared with
the Roosevelt take-over in
1933. For everybody knew
and felt the depression
then. Now the portrayal
must be achieved by se-
mantics and exhortations.
No government at any
time has failed to follow
the rule of self-preserva-
tion. That rule is to con-
vince the public that there
is a dreadful enemy at the
door, and that all must
unite to repel it.
Americans are accus-
tomed to alarms and are
not unaware of the wiles
of politicians. They will
go on doing their work,
keeping a little of what
they earn, and, above all,
maintaining a sense of hu-
mor.
They will note that if a
politician can say that
there is nowhere to go but
up, he can claim all the
gains thereafter to be the
result of his perceptions
and his remedies.
