Public Power Appointments Hint
at a Return to Policies of Ickes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For eight years the Eisenhower administration
in the field of electric power
maintained a policy of
partnership between government and private ownership.
During this respite
from government pressure, the investor-owned
companies made remarkable
progress in their service
to the nation's economy.
Under state and federal
regulation, without the
threat of more severe competition, they have made a
massive contribution to
national wealth and well-being.
The taxes they have
paid have been a large
item in the federal and
state revenues; they have
served their customers
well and at reasonable
rates.

And they have made
great strides in the use of
atomic power for peaceful
purposes. Their investments in atomic power
plants have greatly supplemented those of the AEC.
But now the signs are
most ominous that there
will be a return of the policies of the Ickes day,
when the investor-owned
companies were regarded
as obnoxious trusts and
enemies of the republic.
The first indication was
the appointment of Stewart L. Udall as secretary
of the interior. The holder
of that office is the key to
the government's power
policy. Ickes made it that.
And Udall's record shows
that he voted almost always for public power.
The report to the new
President on natural resources called upon the
Interior Department to
give "immediate attention
to the economic necessity
of inter-regional federal
transmission lines."
The building of such
transmission lines, of
course, gives the government not only control but
something approaching
ownership of interstate
electrical marketing.
For the very important
Federal Power Commission, the most recent appointments have been Joseph C. Swidler and Howard
Morgan, both of whom
have backgrounds only in
public power operations.
Swidler served first as
assistant solicitor in the
Ickes Interior Department.
Then, when the TVA was
created, he went there and
became legal counsel and
secretary in 1945. While
there he developed the legal opinions which permitted
TVA to step far beyond its original purpose
of developing hydro-electric power.

Sen. Barry Goldwater
had this to say about the
nomination of Kenneth
Holum as assistant secretary of the interior for water and power: "He has
been active in several
rural electric co-operative
organizations which have
advocated more and more
federal power. More recently he has been chairman of the Midwest Electric Consumers Assn.,
which has strongly advocated a giant electric power
system in the Upper
Missouri River basin
states."

In the Department of
Agriculture John A.Baker
has been named acting director of the Rural Electrification Administration.
Baker's philosophy toward
government ownership of
everything is indicated by
the fact that he has been
director of "legislative
services" for the National
Farmers' Union.
These appointments and
announcements of policy
all indicate tough times
ahead for the investor-owned electric companies.
