The Trend in the South Is Toward
a Return to the Two-Party System
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This is written at the
conclusion of an automo-
bile trip from San Fran-
cisco to New York.
The route chosen was in
part dictated by weather
conditions, but there was
also the more important
reason that I wanted to
examine some of the
changing political condi-
tions in selected states in
the great crescent from
Texas to Virgina.
Stopovers were made in
Texas, Mississippi and
South Carolina. My con-
clusions, after opportuni-
ties to discuss politics with
informed sources there,
are these:
The Nixon-Lodge vote in
the South represents a
new high in a rising tide
of Republican strength in
that region.
This vote was not sub-
stantially affected by the
religious issue. It was a
vote against centralized
federal government, heavy
taxes, and vast spending
by the federal government.
The greatest Republican
gains were in the urban,
newly industrialized cen-
ters. The back country is
still the stronghold of the
old, one-party democracy.
A new generation is ris-
ing in the South whose
frame of thinking disre-
gards the old issues raised
by the Civil War and Re-
construction. To be a Re-
publican in the South is no
longer unpopular.
In most states the Re-
publican state organiza-
tions fail to elicit respect
and do not lead this new
Republican strength. This
is not so true in Texas as
elsewhere.
The Negro vote is al-
most solidly Democratic.
And the turnout of Ne-
groes in elections is get-
ting larger.
In the 11 Southern
states, ranging from Tex-
as to Virginia and exclud-
ing the border states of
Oklahoma, Missouri, Ken-
tucky and West Virginia,
the Nixon-Lodge ticket re-
ceived a vote approximate-
ly 13% higher than that
cast for Eisenhower-Nix-
on in 1956.
In all those 11 states,
only in Arkansas and Lou-
isiana did Nixon-Lodge
get fewer votes than Ei-
senhower-Nixon in 1956.
In Louisiana the Repub-
lican vote was smaller
than in 1956, but that was
caused by the presence of
a third slate of electors
which received a large
vote.
In Mississippi, also, there
was a third slate of elec-
tors, which received al-
most as many votes as
both the Republican and
Democratic slates com-
bined. But even with that
handicap, Nixon - Lodge
ran far ahead of Eisen-
hower-Nixon.
The percentages of Re-
publican votes in those
states were impressive.
Those ran from a low of
37% in Georgia to abso-
lute majorities in Florida,
Tennessee and Virginia.
An examination of se-
lected all - Negro voting
areas in South Carolina in-
dicated that in 1960 they
voted more than 90% for
Kennedy-Johnson. In the
same areas, Eisenhower-
Nixon in 1956 received
about 40%.
â˜…
The lesson for the Re-
publican Party at the na-
tional level is that greater
concentration of effort and
better organization in the
new and growing urban
communities in the South
can overcome the vote
elsewhere and add to the
Republican Party most of
the Southern states which
went Democratic in 1960.
It is obvious from the
returns that the Republi-
can Party can gain no Ne-
gro votes from a position
on civil rights. All that
Republicans have done in
that direction, both in the
South and in the North,
has gained no votes.
As one observer told
me: "To the Southern Ne-
gro, Lincoln is dead, but
Roosevelt is living."
