Politicians Have Yen to Write,
but Very Seldom Succeed at It
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I was asked recently by
a friendly editor to ask the
new President to give me
the run of the place for a
few days ard then to write
my impressions of the sim-
ilarities and contrasts be-
tween the scene in Wash-
ington after the advent of
F.D.R. in 1933 and now.
He suggested that there
is now the same exciting
action, the same invasion
of professors and writers,
the same proliferation of
ideas of reform and re-
building. As an article of
ephemeral interest, the re-
sult might have had atten-
tion. But I declined. Why?
Because I am vastly
more interested in what is
ahead rather than in what
is now history. One can
hope measurably to influ-
ence what is to be. But the
past is a closed account.
But my friend's sugges-
tion stimulated a few re-
flections on the current
hearty welcome to schol-
ars, professors and artists
of various sorts to partici-
pate in the practical busi-
ness of governing a nation.
As I have seen the world
of politics over a consid-
erable number of years,
those who give their at-
tention to it may be divid-
ed into two groups - espe-
cially those who were sig-
nificant figures either in
the realm of action or the
realm of written comment.
There are those who. in
the midst of the rough
business of practical poli-
tics, either as candidates
or public officials, invari-
ably turn their eyes with
no little envy upon those
whose business is to write
about public affairs.
And then there are those
who, in the cloistered secu-
rity of the college campus
or their studies or even
editorial life, cast posses-
sive glances at the seats
of the official bureaucracy.
Both long for what is not.
With the former group
there have been Theodore
Roosevelt, Coolidge, Al-
fred E. Smith, and Fio-
rello La Guardia, who be-
came columnists after
their retirement. Herbert
Hoover has written exten-
sively since he left the
Presidency in 1933. And
Harry Truman as a senior
citizen has been a histo-
rian of a somewhat du-
bious sort.

Then there were many
professors and writers
who invaded Washington
in the 1930s secking, they
thought, to create a new
order. Most remained a
while and left, unhappy.
Neither group really
succeeded. The practical
politicians little know the
time and Jabor and sense
of the reading public that
make a commentator suc-
cessful. Opinions alone are
not enough. A well-known
name has a short honey-
moon. It has curiosity val-
ue. But writing in the com-
petition of professionals is
a serious business.
Professors, writers, and
artists find the climate of
practical politics chilling.
The atmosphere of politics
is not what might be; it is
what is best for the imme-
diate moment. Compro-
mise is in the air.
Those who inhabit the
world of practical states-
manship look at the next
roll call, not to the next
decade. No matter how
high-sounding may be
their oratory, the next
election is their horizon.
The sensitiveness of the
scholar is a very thin de-
fense for the newcomer.
