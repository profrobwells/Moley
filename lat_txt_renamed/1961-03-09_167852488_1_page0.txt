Recession Believed Receding
There is no doubt now
that the Kennedy adminis-
tration approached the re-
sponsibilities of office with
the advent of Roosevelt in
1933 in mind, for nothing
could be more favorable to
an incoming administra-
tion than to start at the
economic bottom and work
up.
In fact, we were remind-
ed by the orators, over a
period of eight Roosevelt
years, of those dark days
in 1933 and of the hope and
improvement that came
with the New Deal.
But it was not easy to
make a parallel case this
time. No doubt, the lack
of disposition in Congress
to crash relief programs is
that so many members
there have longer and bet-
ter memories than the
young men in the adminis-
tration. Most have lived
through several recessions
and have seen the econ-
omy recover without gov-
ernment stimulation.
Hence, there has been no
repetition of the 100 days
of 1933.
The newspapers on
March 1 presented a pic-
ture of President Kennedy
signing his first bill. This
was not a recipe for a re-
cession. It was a resolution
commemorating the in-
auguration of President
Lincoln 100 years ago.
With this one signing as
an accomplishment, 41
days had elapsed.
In 1933, after 41 days
enough legislation had
been recommended,
passed, signed, and put
into effect to make a re-
spectable showing for sev-
eral sessions of Congress,
While there may be
strong arguments on both
sides of the question of
whether a President and
Congress can help us out
of a recession, there can
be no doubt about the fact
that a recession cannot be
created merely by saying
there is one. Perhaps the
President is learning that
fact slowly, although he is
still saying that things are
getting no better.
The indicators all show,
however, that this claim
is highly doubtful, to say
the least. With the melt-
ing snow a lot of people
will go back to work. One
reliable economist esti-
mates the number as in
excess of a million. Speak-
ing of snow, the severe
winter from which we are
emerging had a lot to do
with the slowing up of
business.
But the situation was
never as bad as in the
three previous recessions.
In mid-January the Fed-
eral Reserve estimated
that the Industrial Pro-
duction Index had de-
clined over the previous
7 months only 6.4%. In
1948-1949 it declined
10.1%. In 1953-1954 it de-
clined 9.6%.
The latter was the time
when the President and
Secretary Humphrey kept
cool heads and refused to
consider strong govern-
ment measures. The econ-
omy recovered by the nat-
ural processes of readjust-
ment.
In 1957-1958 the drop in
the Industrial Production
Index was 14.7%, and
that was largely responsi-
ble for the losses by the
Republican Party in No-
vember of 1958.
We have been in a pe-
riod of readjustment
caused in part by invento-
ries. These have been
measurably corrected. Per-
sonal income is at an all-
time high. Even the un-
employment figures are, in
relation to the number em-
ployed, better than those
in other postwar reces-
sions.
Whether the current re-
covery in the stock market
is due to increased confi-
dence in the future can be
argued from two points of
view. Some believe it is
due to a fear of further
deficits and inflation. Oth-
ers claim that it is because
of the anticipation of bet-
ter business in the spring
and summer.
The American economy
has strange and unpredict-
able ways. Other Presi-
dents have found that to
be true.
