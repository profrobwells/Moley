Humane Purposes Endangered
by Excessive Aid to Unemployed
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since a part of the
gloomy picture of the econ-
omy portrayed by admin-
istration spokesmen in-
volved legislative meas-
ures for increased unem-
ployment compensation,
Congress might well con-
sider the danger of exces-
sive remedies for what
may be a temporary situa-
tion.
It cannot be denied that
reasonable people of all
shades of opinion should
acknowledge that there
should be some sort of
cushion provided by gov-
ernment when a man sud-
denly loses his job through
no fault of his own. He
should have some compen-
sation until he finds an-
other job or is re-employed
in his old one.
But the danger of ex-
cess is present in the pres-
ent situation.
★
Since every state pre-
sents a somewhat different
problem of legislation in
this matter let us consid-
er Illinois as an example.
In that state unemploy-
ment compensation taxes,
wholly paid by the em-
ployers, more than dou-
bled from 1950 to 1960 and
will be nearly tripled from
1959 to 1961.
But labor groups are de-
manding that the weekly
benefits be increased to
provide individuals with
one-half of their gross
weekly pay and to raise
the maximum benefit to
two-thirds of the average
weekly wage of all Illinois
workers. That would be
$66 a week for a single
worker and with an addi-
tional benefit for those
with dependents.
There is also a demand
for increasing the duration
of the benefits from 26 to
39 weeks.
Labor demands also in-
clude provision for all un-
employed to receive such
benefits regardless of past
earnings. Under such a
proposal a worker who has
earned, say, $850 in a year,
would draw benefits
amounting to $832 as com-
pared with the $320 he is
entitled to under present
law. If the duration should
be increased to 39 weeks
his benefits as an unem-
ployed person would be
$1,248, which would be al-
most 50% more for not
working than he would
have received if he had
worked.
★
Such a change would ob-
viously put a big premium
on many to stay unem-
ployed. And since no sys-
tem of inspection and con-
trol could measure accu-
rately the energy and per-
sistence with which an un-
employed person sought
another job, there would
be gross abuses.
In sum these demands, if
granted, would turn what
is supposed to be insurance
into a dole.
Moreover, there is a lot
of political propaganda in-
volved in citing raw unem-
ployment figures to sup-
port such emergency legis-
lation as is being proposed
in the present Congress.
Let us grant that the
number of unemployed
rose from 4.5 million in De-
cember to 5.4 million in
January. But the percent-
age of the unemployed in
relation to the employed
actually declined from
6.8% to 6.6%
Moreover, about half of
the people counted as un-
employed are in seasonal
or short-term employment,
which is not an abnormal
or alarming factor in a vi-
tal, dynamic and mobile
society.
There are only about
1.3 million people in the
nation who have been out
of work at least 15 weeks
and of that number only
half have been jobless for
26 weeks.
★
Thus the center of the
problem is in these people,
not in the growing number
so often cited by those who
are demanding larger
benefits. What is needed,
moreover, is that the gov-
ernment should publicize
percentages of the working
force which is unemployed
and not gross figures which
are meaningless in com-
parison with the figures of
earlier recessions.
