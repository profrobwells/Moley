Rep. Adam Clayton
Powell, who, as chairman
of the House Committee
on Labor and Education,
is in a powerful position
to determine priorities in
legislation, has made a
suggestion which is a con-
siderable embarrassment
to the administration.
He suggests that since
President Kennedy favors
consideration of federal
school aid in two bills, one
to provide aid for public
schools and the other for
aid to parochial and pri-
vate schools, the order of
consideration should be to
have a vote on the latter
bill first.
*
It was the President's
suggestion that since he
believes a constitutional
issue to be paramount that
aid to public schools be
disposed of first.
It may be added that
the proposal of the Pres-
ident is to consider a con-
stitutional bill first and an
unconstitutional bill next.
But if a measure is in his
opinion unconstitutional
it is hard to see how he
could recommend it at all.
The effect of the Powell
proposal would be to in-
volve the whole question
in a long debate and then
possibly foreclose any ac-
tion at all.
Back of the Powell strat-
egy apparently is his wish
to exact from the Presi-
dent a promise to discrim-
inate in the administra-
tion of school aid between
schools that integrate and
those that do not.
The congressman stated
in a television interview a
few weeks ago that if he
could be assured that the
President would in effect
make such a discrimina-
tory order he would not
offer an amendment to the
bill, an amendment which
might well kill the whole
measure.
The very suggestion that
the President could dis-
criminate in that way in
administering an aid bill
is, in itself, alarming. For
if that were true the con-
tention of the President
and other advocates of fed-
eral aid that such aid does
not mean control vanishes
in thin air. For control by
executive order could go
far beyond the question of
racial integration.
★
For example, the Presi-
dent might, on grounds of
national defense or some
other reason, prescribe a
course of study which all
schools receiving federal
aid must follow.
Also, if a bill should be
passed granting federal aid
to all schools, both public
and parochial, the Presi-
dent might, because of his
opinion of constitutional-
ity, deny by executive or-
der any aid to parochial
or any other sort of pri-
vate school.
On one point Powell is
correct. He says in his
more recent statement
that he has found no "hard
and fast rule" of constitu-
tionality concerning aid to
private schools. That is the
opinion of a real authority
on constitutional law,
Prof. Arthur Sutherland
of the Harvard Law
School.

The professor goes
further in saying that he
can see no way by which
the Supreme Court could
rule on the constitution-
ality of federal aid to all
schools. He says this:
"You cannot have a
court test without some-
one being hurt and bring-
ing suit. Now whose toes
are being stepped on if
the United States govern-
ment gives aid to private
and church schools? Only
the taxpayer whose money
it is.
"But the Supreme Court
has long since established
the principle that a federal
taxpayer has no standing
in court to challenge the
constitutionality of a fed-
eral statute."
