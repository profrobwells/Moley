Tax Exemptions May
Solve School Crisis
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the most recent state-
ment on the Kennedy pro-
posal for federal aid to the
public schools Cardinal
Spellman, archbishop of
New York, said:
"A program of federal
aid that would accord
equivalent benefits to chil-
dren attending private
and church-related schools
and yet not violate the
Constitution would seem
to be an attainable objec-
tive. The specifics are
matters for the discretion
of Congress. If for consti-
tutional reason children
attending church-related
schools cannot be given
equal benefits by the same
methods proposed for chil-
dren attending public
schools, then Congress
should weigh alternative
means, or a combination of
means, to provide that
equality. Suggestions
made, in addition to long-
term, low interest rate
loans, include tax benefits
for parents, tuition subsi-
dies and other forms of
help such as assistance for
the non-religious aspects
of those schools."
The device of tax relief
in that statement, as the
text of the cardinal's state-
ment shows, is not his pro-
posal, but it would, if
equitable, probably meet
his approval.

The fact is that many of
the highly controversial
spending measures before
Congress might well be
approached through tax
relief of some kind.
Sen. Goldwater has pro-
posed such an approach in
the case of medical aid for
the aged as well as in aid
to education. Former Vice
President Nixon proposed
two years ago that meth-
od of helping parents who
have sons and daughters
of college age. In the pres-
ent school aid controversy
the method is gaining fa-
vor among members of
Congress who are anxious
to avoid a sharp choice
between the opposition of
the Roman Catholic
Church and the demands
of President Kennedy.
Rightly considered aid
in many lines through fed-
eral handouts is a very
clumsy and wasteful meth-
od of meeting needs. The
dispensation of such aid
is a complicated business
requiring a large increase
in the Washington bu-
reaucracy.
For every dollar that
passes from the taxpayer
to the recipient a consider-
able part, sometimes ex-
cessively large, is con-
sumed in the federal over-
head. Then, since when-
ever a dollar of the tax-
payer's money goes for any
sort of aid the bureaucracy
exercises a large and in-
creasing degree of control,
the end result is a su-
preme and centralized gov-
ernment. It is that control
that opponents of federal
school aid, Catholics and
non-Catholics alike, fear
the most.
â˜…
In this instance of
school aid a constitutional
question has been raised.
But the First Amendment
upon which such constitu-
tional doubts rest merely
says that there shall be
no "establishment" of a
state religion and there
shall be no bar to the exer-
cise of religion.
Certainly under a tax
deduction plan there could
be no complaint that a
non-Catholic was being
taxed for a religious school
providing the tax deduc-
tion could be applied only
to the non-religious por-
tion of the education of a
child in a Catholic or other
private school.
Such a tax deduction
could apply to the portion
of the property tax which
is applied to education in
non-religious portions of
the curriculum. Religious
teaching is, in time, only
a small portion of the
school day in a religious
school. The rest is in solid
basic subjects.

This would, it is true, re-
quire of local and state
authorities some degree of
careful management and
apportionment. But that
is a small price to pay for
the removal of the threat
to local presented by the
growing rule of a super-
centralized national gov-
ernment.
Here is an avenue to the
prevention of a sharp clash
which might well ignite
religious controversy
which all lovers of a free
system of government
must try to avoid.
