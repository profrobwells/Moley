GOP Needs a Full-Time Manager
It is now rumored in
Washington that Rep. Wil-
liam E. Miller is under
consideration by Republi-
can leaders for the chair-
manship of the Republican
National Committee to
succeed Sen. Thruston
Morton, who is to retire
about June 1.
Miller's voting record
shows that he is essential-
ly not a liberal Republi-
can in the pattern of Gov.
Rockefeller and Sens. Ja-
vits and Cooper. His ca-
pacity as a member of the
House of Representatives
is excellent. And his serv-
ice as a chairman of the
Republican Congressional
Committee succeeding the
late Rep. Simpson has
given him some experience
as a party manager.

Another possible selec-
tion for national chairman
is State Chairman Ray
Bliss of Ohio, whose suc-
cess in party management
in Ohio in 1960 was sen-
sational.
Consideration of these
men brings up a very im-
portant distinction in the
type of leadership needed
in the Republican Party.
On the other hand there
is the job of management,
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
which means sitting at a
desk in Washington, or-
ganizing and directing a
large staff, instructing
state chairmen in raising
money, and organizing
party gatherings.
The latter has been the
sort of work at which Bliss
has performed with amaz-
ing skill. It should be a
full-time salaried position.
The job of evangelism
can be and has been done
on a part time basis. Con-
gressmen and senators
have served in that ca-
pacity in recent years. In
this role Rep. Miller would
serve well.
The problem which Re-
publican leaders, includ-
ing the members of the na-
tional committee, must
face is to make some ar-
rangement which will pro-
vide both management and
evangelism. Some arrange-
ment which would enlist
both Bliss and Miller
would be ideal.
But the attainment of
that ideal would require
each of the individuals
named to be of equal
standing and prestige and
that neither would in the
performance of his duties
be the superior of the oth-
er.
Of the two functions,
management is by all
means the more impor-
tant. For there are many
party leaders who can
make an inspiring speech.
But there are few people
who have been raised in
politics who know how to
be competent managers.
Another problem which
should be solved in reor-
ganizing the Republican
Party at the national level
is to provide a close work-
ing arrangement between
the Republican Congres-
sional Committee and the
national committee.

The former's task is to
help elect Republican
members of the House. It
has its own staff, which
operates with a good deal
of efficiency. Upon its ef-
forts will depend the
chances of Republican
gains in the congression-
al elections in 1962.
When there is a Re-
publican President, he can
be the boss of both groups
if he has the political skill
to be a real leader. But
there will be no Republi-
can President for a few
years. That is why the
selection of adequate party
leadership will be such a
problem.
