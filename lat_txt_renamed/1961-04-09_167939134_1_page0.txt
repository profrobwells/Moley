The word "bankrupt"
has over the years cast a
chill over most Americans.
It means to most of us
failure and impoverishment.
Also most people associate
it exclusively with the
failure of a business.
A most interesting light
is cast upon the word by a
study just released by the
Family Economics Bureau
of the Northwestern National
Life Insurance Co.
of Minneapolis.
In the first place 90%
of all bankruptcies filed
are by individuals rather
than businesses. And of
that large number of personal
bankruptcies the great
majority are worker-family
cases.
It is somewhat alarming
that these personal, non-
business bankruptcies
have increased 300% in
the last 10 years. The record
total in 1960 was 114,-
166.

And yet during those
10 years personal income
has risen 50% and the total
personal savings in the
nation have nearly doubled.
It is also true that
consumer credit is reported
to be in good shape
with installment payments
continuing at a good rate
even through the recession
from which we are now
recovering.
According to the testimony
of credit men, personal
loan officials, referees in
bankruptcy and credit
counsellors, the chief
cause of family debt
troubles is not unemployment,
although that has been
somewhat more prominent
in the last year. Nor is
substandard income an
important reason. Nor is
it illness or other bodily
misfortune.
The most important reason
year after year for personal
bankruptcy is incompetent
management of a fairly
good family income.

The survey found that
the typical family which
finds debt to be more than
it can sustain is in the
$4,000 to $6,000 range in
income. Such families find
themselves owing 12 to 18
different creditors with an
aggregate load of about
half a year's income. Home
mortgages are not included
in that total.
The incident that usually
sets off the application
for bankruptcy is the garnishment
of the salary
check or some other legal
proceeding.
When the crisis comes
there are three possible
ways to meet it. One is to
file a petition for bankruptcy.
Another is to run away,
"fly the coop." And a third
is to pull in belts, get, if
possible, time extensions
from creditors and make
a supreme effort to pay off
the debt and to avoid more
debt.
It is interesting to note
that two-thirds of those
who decide upon the latter
course succeed in attaining
solvency again. This is
done by strict budgeting.

The Family Economics
Bureau suggests three
rules for families to follow
if they are to avoid a
personal financial crisis:
1-Before taking on a
new obligation, apply to
yourself the rule most
bankers follow in considering
family loans. One such
personal loan official suggests
that the individual
should add up all his obligations,
including the new
one, and then see if he
will then have enough to
provide a margin for emergencies.
2-Keep a budget.
3-For the sake of a new
generation try to have the
local high school give practical
instruction in personal
income management.
