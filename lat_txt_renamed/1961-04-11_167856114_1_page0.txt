Postwar Presidents Have Faced
Big Expectations, Limited Funds
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Kennedy is
finding himself in the
same fiscal dilemma which
has been faced by his two
predecessors since the beginning of the Korean
War.
On the one hand are the
promises he has made and
which are well remembered by the prospective
beneficiaries. On the other
hand are the inexorable
limits of the revenues
from the present high
rates of the income tax.
All three Presidents
have resorted to what
might be called "tokenism," a word widely used
in the Negro press to express complaints against
what their leaders believe
to be the slow gains accorded them in civil rights.
But the "tokenism" which
Presidents have adopted is
in the fiscal field.
*
The tremendous aggregate of expectations has
been inherited from the
prewar Roosevelt policies
by his three successors. In
those years from 1933 to
1940 federal emphasis was
laid upon the responsibility of the federal government to provide for all
sorts of real or claimed
needs under the general
welfare loophole in the
Constitution.
Immense federal obligations were recklessly
promised in political oratory. Politicians had little
concern for the future.
They were concerned in
the production of immediate votes.
The following comparisons are rough calculations
but they will suffice to
show the impasse in which
the Presidents find themselves.
In 1940 when the great
wave of expectations had
been well whipped up the
population was about 130
million. It is now 180 million.
In 1940 the size of the
economy measured by the
gross national product was
$100 billion. It is now $500
billion.
But the federal government was getting from
taxes then about $5 billion. It is now getting $80
billion.
Meanwhile we have had
two wars with an increase
in the expenditures for
the military, and war-connected items and the service on the national debt
are taking much more
than half of that income
from taxes.
But the federal government has about reached
the point of diminishing
returns so far as tax fields
are concerned.
And so all three Presidents since the war have
resorted to "tokenism."
Teachers who expect
the federal government
through its present plan
to increase their pay
should note that the Kennedy plan would pay only
about 3% of the school
costs.
Then after that is divided between aid for construction and teachers' salaries, the pay check of the
average teacher is going to
look pretty much the same.
*
The President in his
housing message stated
that 14 million families
are ill-housed. But when
the proposal he makes for
federal aid is analyzed it
would pay only about one-
half of 1% of the need.
Perhaps the American
people ought to study
some of the facts of economic life, learn how to
take political promises and
quiet their expectations.
