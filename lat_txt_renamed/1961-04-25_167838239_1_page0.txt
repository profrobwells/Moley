President Urged to Push Reform
That He Advocated as a Senator
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Bradford Morse, new
congressman from Massa-
chusetts, has called upon
the President to put into
effect a reform, which was
sponsored by Mr. Kennedy
in 1957 when he was a
senator.
This legislation, which
passed the Senate by
unanimous vote and later
by a large majority in the
House, was designed to
enforce one of the major
recommendations of the
second Hoover Commission,
of which the President’s
father, Joseph P.
Kennedy, was a member.
The bill became Public
Law 85-759.
In its report early in the
Eisenhower administration
the Hoover Commission
called attention to a
long standing defect in
the method of making up
the annual budget and in
the practices of the appropriations committees
of Congress. Reduced to
simple, non-technical
terms it was this:
On the recommendation
of the appropriations committees
Congress was in
the habit of voting funds
for new programs annually.
But since many such
appropriations were not
spent in the year designated
they were marked
as “obligated” and carried
over from year to year.
★
In the years which followed there was no review
of these unexpended
funds by the appropriation
committees of Congress.
Thus Congress lost control
of expenditures and could
not control or even predict
accurately the amount to
be spent.
The recommendation of
the Hoover Commission
was that Congress should
by law and in practice review
annually not only
the requests for new appropriations for new purposes but should take into
review all of the unexpended balances from
previous authorizations
and appropriations.
This would bring into
focus annually the real
fiscal situation of the government and its many
agencies.
This bill, in combination
with the cost-basis bill
passed last year, would
give us far greater control
over the amounts of money
the government will spend
in each year.
But despite the urging
of President Eisenhower
in two of his budget messages following the passage
of PL 85-759 the
House Appropriations
Committee refused to put
the plan into practice.
In his letter to the President Rep. Morse expressed disappointment
that President Kennedy
has not recommended that
the provisions of his own
plan be adopted.
In reply a special counsel to the President noted
that the idea has been
adopted in the requests
for appropriations by 75%
of the civilian agencies
and that the President had
urged that the remaining
agencies, including the Defense Department, get
their accounting in shape.
As Morse pointed out,
the various departments
were carrying over from
past appropriations in the
form of “obligated” funds
the vast total of over $37
billion. Over much of this
Congress simply has refused to assume, reviewing responsibility.
★
The value of such a reform, if the President
would put the heat upon
a Congress of his own party, would be that in a year
such as this it might be
possible to balance the
budget by simply looking
over these projects and
programs to see if some
could be deferred or
dropped entirely.
Now since a deficit will
appear this year and a
larger one next year, it
should be the determined
policy of the President
and of Congress to prevent these inflationary
drains. In short it is time
for the government to put
its house in order.
