Cuban Debacle Caused
by Civilian Blunders
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The egregious hyprocri-
sy of Ambassador Adlai
Stevenson in his wordy
distinction concerning
American "intervention"
can only be matched by
the utter failure of civil-
ians in high offices to for-
mulate plausible tactics
and strategy and to appre-
ciate the highly special-
ized and difficult operation
on which the Cuban rebel
force embarked.
Any navy, marine, or
army commander who par-
ticipated in an invasion or
amphibious operation dur-
ing the Pacific war would
appreciate the tragic folly
of the recent assault on
the Island of Cuba.
Any sergeant or private
who has hit a beach knows
how extremely difficult it
is to move the first thou-
sand yards or the first
mile, even after heavy
naval gunfire and air sup-
port and with continued
bombardment and close
air support.

No responsible military
commander would have en-
dorsed the operation
staged a few days ago.
There is such a thing as
American amphibious doc-
trine, developed in the
1930s and 1940s: Marine
Gen. Alexander A. Vande-
grift could write in Au-
gust, 1944, "The gamble at
Guadalcanal has swelled
into a sure thing at Nor-
mandy and Guam."
But to be successful, a
landing on unfriendly ter-
rain requires precise and
exhaustive planning. There
is the need for accurate in-
formation from intelligence
upon which a commander
can make a sound decision.
In the Pacific and other
theaters, the element of
chance was minimized by
the development of sound
intelligence techniques
and methods. Quite ob-
viously, intelligence was
far from what it should
have been to guide the
rebel forces.
It has been written of
our amphibious operations
in the last war that since
the landing force was
charged with securing the
beachhead and moving in-
land, more intelligence
was required than for a
large-scale "raid."
Intelligence on the ene-
my in surrounding areas
was essential if his efforts
to dislodge the landing
force were to be frustrat-
ed. The attitude of civil-
ians was ascertained. The
problem of supply of the
force once landed meant
that intelligence on mines,
obstacles, and hydrograph-
Moley
ic conditions had to be de-
veloped and disseminated
swiftly and thoroughly.
Logistics consequently
were based in part on in-
telligence. The two worked
closely together.
A plan attributed to the
Eisenhower adminis-
tration is said to have
called for air support and
logistic support. A mili-
tary commander, knowing
of the presence of jets on
Castro airfields, of Russian
tanks, and artillery, Czech
automatic weapons, and of
Soviet-trained advisers
and technicians in Castro's
army, would regard as lu-
nacy an assault on Cuba
without these vital support
elements. And these facts
were known. That the ci-
vilian population would
rise against an army and
militia of more than 200,-
000 was a delusion.

In all probability our
military men will not be
making statements about
the fiasco undertaken by
the Cuban exiles with the
blessing of our civilian
strategists. Mr. Kennedy,
having served in the Navy
and, perhaps, having read
contemporary military his-
torians, must realize that
the "go ahead" to the rebel
invasion force was out of
touch with recent military
doctrine.
In our system, national
policy decisions are in the
hands of civilians. But this
does not mean that for mil-
itary ventures they are
qualified to conduct the
planning, intelligence-
gathering and evaluation
needs or to decide upon the
tactics and support re-
quired.
