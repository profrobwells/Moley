Cuban Developments May Alter
Kennedy's Conduct of Affairs
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
James Thurber's de-
lightful, day-dreaming
Walter Mitty, who imag-
ined himself dashingly en-
gaged in thrilling exploits,
had nothing on certain in-
tellectuals who recently
found themselves partici-
pating in the Cuban affair.
But when the near
make-believe of a good
many administration ad-
visers evaporated, it was
not to face the humdrum
of martial conflict, but to
confront an accurate bar-
rage of criticism never
dreamed of in the Harvard
Yard or beneath the elms
of college campuses. A
scramble to shallow, ex-
posed foxholes of excuse
followed. It is to Mr. Ken-
nedy's credit that he pro-
claimed his own responsi-
bility. But there is every
reason to believe that he
will not rely as heavily
upon these men as before.
There is sufficient evi-
dence in a number of de-
velopments to convince
the politician in Mr. Ken-
nedy that his intellectual
side and those who flatter
it have failed him.
Following his inaugura-
tion, numerous men who
have sparkled on the
banks of the Charles in
Cambridge moved to the
banks of the Potomac.
They had contributed un-
sparingly during the cam-
paign. The election won,
broad fields of national and
world affairs and the ad-
ministration of the execu-
tive branch were ready to
be fertilized by their teem-
ing brains.
Mr. Kennedy's supreme
confidence in his person-
ality and political prowess
was fed by these men. His
administration was to be
highly personalized.
The intellectuals who
surrounded him deplored
the methodical, careful
conduct of affairs under
President Eisenhower. In-
formal, hurried conversa-
tions took the place of staff
work and meetings of the
Cabinet and the National
Security Council, which
were regarded as a "waste
of time."
So old heads made way
for eggheads. Experience
made way for theories.
Professionals made way
for amateurs.
Most unfortunately, a
misreading of history by
those who were to give the
new President's adminis-
tration a "sense of history"
has already led to grievous
consequences. Mr. Khru-
shchev would co-operate in
"easing Cold War ten-
sions," the professors be-
lieved. But they had been
hoodwinked by the dicta-
tor when they visited Rus-
sia last year.

Greater shipments of
military equipment and
technical advisers to Laos
and Cuba, pressure in
South Viet-Nam, outra-
geous behavior, and
stronger statements on
disarmament have been
Mr. Khrushchev's re-
sponse to Mr. Kennedy's
conviction that he could
succeed where others have
failed.
The full facts behind the
Cuban debacle are not be-
ing released. Military men,
unlike the liberal intellec-
tuals who are unaccus-
tomed to taking orders and
recoil at having a "lid"
closed over them, have not
been talking. Reports that
the Joint Chiefs of Staff
were a party to such an
unrealistic "invasion" plan
are highly questionable.

Closer to the truth, per-
haps, is a report that when
a congressman asked Gen.
Lemnitzer whether the
JCS had approved the ven-
ture, the President cut in,
saying, "The JCS was
neither asked to approve
nor disapprove; they were
simply informed of plans."
To blend the efforts of
practical men who have
years of experience and
strong opinions of their
own with the theoretical
new group of advisers is
a challenge to the Presi-
dent. His reliance may well
shift to the former, while
many of the latter return
to their university chairs.
