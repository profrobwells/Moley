School Board Vote Shows Clamor
for Federal Aid Is Not Grass Roots
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are three sorts of
people who bear a heavy
responsibility for the ed-
ucation of American chil-
dren in the public schools.
There are the members
of the tens of thousands
of school boards, elected
-by-the citizens of the com--
munities to build, maintain
and operate the means for
the education of their chil-
dren. There are the teach-
ers, who for the most part
pursue their fine calling
with devotion and efficien-
cy. And there are the
school administrators, who
are generally employed by
the school boards to look
after the day-to-day man-
agement of the schools.
While there is no official
count to prove it, it is pos-
sible that most teachers
favor some sort of federal
financial aid to the public
schools. At any rate, the
largest association which
is supported by the teach-
ers, the National Educa-
tion Assn., has lobbied for
years for federal aid.
Most of the associations
of administrators, and they
are great joiners, and or-
ganizers of associations,
have also lobbied for fed-
eral aid. They always have
ideas about how some
more money might be
spent.
But ultimately the mem-
bers of the school boards
should be the best judges
of whether they can pro-
vide, within the financial
capabilities of the commu-
nity, the sort of education
that they want for the
children.
These members are cit-
izens whose living is made
in various ways. Their ac-
tivity as members of the
school board is their con-
tribution to the civic life
of the community. It is the
children of their flesh and
blood and of their neigh-
bors' to whom their pub-
lic service is dedicated.
They want the best and
most wholesome training
for those children.
To get the means for
that education, they have
to go to their constituent
citizens and induce them
to pay the taxes and to
supply the bonds neces-
sary to keep the schools
in the best possible con-
dition.
This imposition of lay
control over education is
in the best and most es-
sential traditions in a free
society. Under our tradi-
tions it must be the school
board which must judge
the quality and adequacy
of the instruction.
In many communities
over the years there has
been a good deal of fric-
tion between the school
board members and the
supervisory people. Some-
how board members have
come to the simple con-
clusion that they are not
getting their money's
worth.
It has been significant
during all the years in
which the subject of fed-
eral aid has been raging
that the proponents of the
movement are not the ac-
tual people who must raise
the money. And so in a
meeting in Philadelphia
recently the delegates of
the National School Boards
Assn. broke their tradition
of silence on national is-
sues and voted against fed-
eral aid. They indicated in
the debate that they be-
lieve federal aid will bring
federal control. And they
do not want control taken
from where it has been,
in the local community.
They believe, quite cor-
rectly, that they have been
meeting needs adequate-
ly.
Thus, the clamor for fed-
eral aid is not a grass roots
movement. It is not an ed-
ucational or fiscal issue. It
is a political issue, in
which politicians in Con-
gress and the administra-
tion seek to please and ap-
pease the many profession-
al associations which stir
up the votes with unfair,
inaccurate, and damaging
distortions concerning
school needs.
