Children Are the Real Victims
of the School Integration War
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Impartial visitors in the
South since the acute con-
troversy over segregation
culminated in 1955 have
noted that those who have
suffered the most have
been Negroes.
In the long period since
reconstruction days, there
had developed between the
races relations which were
mutually beneficial. But
under the pressure of out-
side groups and interests
for complete integration,
this relationship has dete-
riorated. And in that
changed condition the Ne-
groes have been the major
victims.
*
Also, under the pressure
of court orders the chil-
dren of both races have
been the real losers when
state and county authori-
ties have discontinued sup-
port of public schools. An
excellent example of this
is in Prince Edward Coun-
ty, Va.
In 1959, when Prince
Edward County was or-
dered to integrate its pub-
lic schools, the county
board of supervisors lev-
ied no more taxes for ed-
ucation, and the public
schools were closed.
The people of the coun-
ty then proceeded to or-
ganize a private school
system. The support of
this system was at first
provided from private
sources. But later state tu-
ition grants were supplied,
at the rate of $125 for each
elementary school child
and $150 for those of high-
school grade. Local contri-
butions were added at the
rate of $100 per child.
*
White citizens then
--urged Negro parents to or-
ganize their own schools,
utilizing state tuition
grants similar to those
used for the white chil-
dren. The Southside
Schools, Inc., was organ-
ized to provide educational
facilities for Negro chil-
dren equal to those organ-
ized for white children
Parents of Negro children
were instructed how to ob-
tain state tuition grants.
But in December, 1959,
an attorney for the
NAACP, Oliver W. Hill of
Richmond, came to the
county and told a Negro
meeting:
"Scme henighted indi-
viduals are trying to en-
tice you away from your
rights by promising you
whatever they (Southside
Schools, Inc.) do, they are
not doing this to improve
your best interests
all you are losing is one or
two years of Jim Crow
education but at the same
time in your leisure you
can gather more basic edu-
cation than you would in
five years of Jim Crow
schools."
Negro parents, except
one, then declined to re-
quest state tuition grants.
And the Negro children
went without schooling
while white children were
given their education in
church basements, librar-
ies, and barns. Negro chil-
dren occupied the "lei-
sure" mentioned by Mr.
Hill in playing about,
without direction and
without any "basic edu-
cation."
This situation has been
widely publicized outside
the state of Virginia as a
"lockout," with deplorable
results.
And so the NAACP
went to court again, before
Judge Oren R. Lewis in
Richmond. Atty. Gen. Rob-
ert F. Kennedy presented
a petition to the court to
intervene as co-plaintiff in
the case. This sets a new
precedent, for never be-
fore has the federal gov-
ernment sought to act as
a co-plaintiff. Previously,
it has entered such cases
as "a friend of the court."
â˜…
At the same time, the
U.S. attorney general has
asked for an injunction to
force the reopening of the
public schools of Prince
Edward County on an in-
tegrated basis. Also, the
attorney general has asked
for injunctions to prevent
the state of Virginia from
making grants to any
county in the state until
the Prince Edward schools
are reopened, and to stop
the state from allowing
county tax credits for citi-
zens making contributions
to private schools.
And so there is begin-
ning a long legal struggle.
Meanwhile, children of
both races are the major
victims of inadequate ed-
ucation.
