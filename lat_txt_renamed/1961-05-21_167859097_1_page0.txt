Enthusiasm for Peace Corps Fades
It would be unwise at
this time for the Republican
opposition to make
an issue of the Peace
Corps. The international
situation is too tense to
justify that sort of exercise.
The idea was, no doubt,
born of real idealism. But
the haste in which it was
launched prevented a
sound appraisal of the dangers
and difficulties involved. These considerations
are now being advanced
in the hope that
those charged with the
project might profit.
Many people who have
been actively concerned
with the problems of backward
nations are pointing
out the problems that lie
ahead.
One of these is Dr. Milton
L. Itakove of the University
of Chicago. He said
recently:
"I would say that the
name 'Peace Corps' is
a misnomer, a gimmick.
May I remind you that
Sargent Shriver, in his excellent
brief presentation
to President Kennedy, put
teaching first on his list of
needs.

"Now, we don't doubt
that the elimination of illiteracy
is one of the great
needs of the world. But
may I remind you that the
illiterate peoples of the
world rarely cause any
permanent disruption of
peace. It is the literate,
the educated that cause all
the trouble. We should not
call this the 'Peace Corps,'
it is not a Peace Corps and
that is a most unfortunate
name."
There is the most sincerely
asked question
whether the federal government
under Point 4 is
best equipped to prepare
individuals for handling
another language, for
standing up to the very
severe environment, and
for giving instruction in
primitive agriculture and
in furthering construction
and health systems.
Agricultural colleges
and technical high
schools could do a better
job. And it is a safe guess
that a young man without
a college education, who
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
has worked in the fields
and ranches of the South
and West, who has worked
along with Mexican labor,
might prove to be a better
bet to withstand the rigors
of Central Africa than
most college graduates.
Dr. Richard Houk of De
Paul University, a geographer
familiar with
Portuguese Africa, points
out that the areas where
missions and advisers are
most needed are invariably
those places where living
conditions for a young
American are most
difficult, if not perilous.
Dr. Houk says:
"I doubt greatly whether
the average young
American can stick it out
two years in some of the
spots I have seen. The living
conditions are frightful.
For a North American
the water is unpalatable,
even dangerous. Therefore,
such Americans must
have their water brought
in. Disease is rampant.
Therefore they must have
doctors and medicines.
"In addition, the sheer
psychological impact of
hardship and loneliness is
going to be very hard to
meet and withstand. I
think that most of the
volunteers will be begging
to come home before
the end of their two-year
term. This will create a
very bad impression on
the people we are trying
to help."

On a recent trip to the
Indian Punjab, Mr. Shriver
found that no one knew
just what his proposal was.
They expected him to produce
the products of our
factories, not of our universities.
Training of the volunteers
in the announced
camp in Puerto Rico,
which will catch the sea
breezes, will not even
approximate the environment
of an African or
Asian forest heavy with
humidity and heat. Under
a hurried program of this
sort, there will be too
many casualties after the
first few months. The
damage to American goodwill
might be very severe.
