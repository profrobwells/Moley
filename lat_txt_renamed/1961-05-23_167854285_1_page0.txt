Missouri has a little of
all of the best of the Unit-
ed States. It is of the
North and the South, the
East and the West. In
primitive days it was the
point of departure for
those who sought new
homes in the untracked
West. It has ruggedness
and it has sophistication.
And out there the spirit of
1776 has not perished from
the earth.
It also knows how to
take a joke. Like John
Falstaff, Missourians not
only can see what is funny
in others, but they can see
humor in themselves.
Mark Twain found in the
state a hilarious treasury.
It is good that we have
Missouri these days when
our sources of jokes are
running dry. What with
our new and strange col-
leagues in the United Na-
tions, jokes at the expense
of races, nationalities, and
sects are off-bounds. And
with powerful pressure
groups in Washington rep-
resenting every race, reli-
gion, and occupation, jokes
about race, religion, doc-
tors, lawyers, unionists,
bankers, and teachers raise
trouble in Congress.
We can fortunately still
make fun of ourselves and
Congress. H. L. Mencken
and Will Rogers got plenty
of mileage from those
sources back in the 1920s.
But the genuine native
stuff is in Missouri. Long
years ago, a Missouri
statesman said that Mis-
souri raised cotton and
corn and Democrats and
cockleburrs.
Not long ago, the citi-
zens of McDonald County,
the extreme southwestern
corner of Missouri, slipped
some cockleburrs into the
cushioned chairs of state
bureaucrats and legisla-
tors. Plenty of action fol-
lowed.
In the fashion of most
states, Missouri's adminis-
tration issued this year
an elegant brochure and
map showing points of in-
terest and recreation. Mc-
Donald County citizens
found three of their major
towns missing from the
literature â€” Pineville,
Noel and Southwest. It
was not a printer's error.
An employee of the state
highway department said
the omission was deliber-
ate. He said the area was
"too commercial."
A state senator who rep-
resents the four counties
of Southwest Missouri tells
that "first we considered
seceding from the state.
Then I introduced a reso-
lution in the state senate
to set up a study commis-
sion to consider asking ad-
joining counties in Arkan-
sas and Oklahoma to join
McDonald in forming a 51st
state in the Union. This
is possible under Article
IV, Section 4 of the Con-
stitution of the United
States. All it needs is the
agreement of the state
legislatures and Congress."
It was then decided to
drop the idea of joining
with the Arkansas and
Oklahoma counties and in-
stead to set up a territorial
government in McDonald
County. A president was
elected, and an attorney
general.
Now things were really
moving. Some citizens
started to print passports
and to plan for a special
postage stamp.
Then some old-age pen-
sioners got worried. They
were afraid that if the
county left the United
States they would lose
their allowances.
It was then planned to
erect signs on the high-
ways leading into the
county saying, "You are
now entering unmapped,
uncharted areas on the
border of Arkansas and
Oklahoma."
I have not heard the
last word from the insur-
rection. But since almost
every day the public press
records an account of some
military coup, such as the
recent one in Korea, Mc-
Donald County is to be
congratulated. The United
States at least has closed
the coup gap.
