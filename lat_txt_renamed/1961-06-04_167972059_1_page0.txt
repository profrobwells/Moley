The Evils of Unlawful Spending
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may seem ungracious
to fuss with our hurried
and harried young President
about a few billion
dollars while he is already
juggling so many hot pokers.
If he should miss one
of them, it might ignite
the powder pits of war.
But he asked for this
job. And when the country
employed him, he had
made certain commitments
about fiscal responsibility.
He had also made
many comments about the
lack of prudence displayed
by his predecessor.
â˜…
Also, he is well equipped
with people whose whole
time is supposed to be devoted
to caring for our
money. There is the secretary
of the treasury and
the director of the budget,
whom he can order in
a few words to fight for
fiscal prudence before the
committees of Congress.
There is also the fact that
he is the head of the dominant
party in Congress
and can, if he chooses, give
a few orders to Messrs.
Rayburn, McCormack,
Mansfield and Humphrey.
When he was Sen. Kennedy
in 1957, he sponsored
and secured the passage of
a bill which was designed
to require the houses of
Congress to reconsider annually
all funds previously
appropriated but unspent.
And in arguing for this
measure, he used some
fine words about fiscal responsibility.
*
But since he has been
President, he has done
nothing, and his financial
chiefs have done nothing,
to end the practice which
he condemned. It was estimated
at that time in 1957
that something more than
$30 billion was thus carried
over without reconsideration
and reappropriation.
There is also a practice
called "back-door" spending
which the President
has done nothing to curb
or end. There are various
ways in which "back-door"
spending may be accomplished,
but the main one
is authorization given by
Congress to some agency
in the executive department
to draw money at
will from the Treasury
without specific annual
appropriations passed by
the appropriations committees
of Congress and
approved in regular order
each year.
In most cases it means
that the money thus taken
is drawn from public debt
receipts. In the present
unbalanced state of federal
finances, it is simply added
to the aggregate of the
national debt.
The House Appropriations
Committee and its
able chairman, Clarence
Cannon of Missouri, have
denounced this bypassing
of their constitutional authority,
but other committees
in the House and Senate
have ignored such protests.
In his last two or three
messages, President Eisenhower
recognized the evil
in this irregular way of
spending and recommended
that there should be no
further examples of it. But
in the tremendous flood of
spending proposals sent to
Congress by President
Kennedy there are included
somewhere between $20
billion and $30 billion of
such expenditures, stretching
from two to five years
in the future.
Here are a few examples
of "back-door" spending
recommended by the President
and under consideration
by Congress: $2.5 billion
for urban renewal;
$1.25 billion for college
housing; $5.5 billion in the
latest proposal for foreign
development; an indeterminate
amount in the farm
plan; more for mortgage
loans, and other billions
for veterans' and other
sorts of housing, "community
facility" loans and
"open space" land purchasing.
There are many others,
carried over from previous
Congresses.
*
There is something extremely
cynical in this contemptuous
disregard of the
plain directive in the Constitution
that "no money
shall be drawn from the
Treasury, but in consequence
of appropriations
made by law," and also in
brushing aside the protests
of responsible Democratic
members of the
House who have denounced
"back-door"
spending for several years.
Apparently the President
and his liberal friends
in Congress feel that the
public is too dumb to understand
what is really
happening to its money.
