Organization: the Key
to Reviving the GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I take as my text on
this occasion a statement
made by Sen. Morton be-
fore his resignation as Re-
publican national chair-
man when he heard about
the election of John G.
Tower in Texas:
"A Republican has won
the Senate seat in Texas,
therefore we have shown
the strength of the party."
It would be hard to find
a more vivid example of
self-delusion. "We"
if
Morton means the Repub-
lican organization of which
he was chairman
had
little, to do with Tower's
success.
The election was won by
an attractive young man
who had convictions and
the capacity to express
them. He won because in
Texas there are hundreds
of thousands who are not
happy with the liberal
Democrats who are in con-
trol in the White House
and in Congress.
Tower's election was
not a demonstration of Re-
publican strength. But it
was a clear indication of
a great Republican oppor-
tunity.
*
It has been estimated
that there were not more
than 100,000 real Republi-
cans included in the
Tower vote. In addition
to them, there were 350,-
000 who were not vitally
attached to any party. The
enlistment of people like
these all over the nation
in a vital Republican Par-
ty is the job of Republican
organizations, from the na-
tional committee to the
counties, townships, and
wards of the cities.
In general, a party is
seeking for votes. Now the
order is reversed. Millions
of worried Americans are
looking for a party to rep-
resent them.
In the South, most peo-
ple in the urban centers
are no longer bound by
Democratic traditions dat-
ing back to the Civil War
and the Reconstruction.
In the North, there are
also millions who want to
make their votes effective.
But those millions, who
could be the basis of a
majority of the electorate,
have not yet found the
means of effective politi-
cal action.
What is necessary to
mobilize this latent
strength? Two things: vig-
orous organization in the
states and local communi-
ties, and understandable,
affirmative party policies.
The first in importance is
organization.
But most of those who
are talking about Repub-
licanism, seem unaware of
the need for strong organ-
ization. They are pro-
Moley
pounding a philosophy
which would turn the
clock back, or they are
talking about being more
liberal than the Demo-
crats, or they are wasting
their time by idle specu-
lation about candidates in
1964.
But unless the Repub-
lican Party gets itself bet-
ter organized in the states
carried by Kennedy in
1960, no Republican can-
didate can win in 1964.

The fact is that there
are several centers of Re-
publicanism in Washing-
ton now, each of which is
pretending to speak for
the party. There is the
national committee and its
staff and chairman, there
is the Republican Con-
gressional Commit-
tee, there is the "Ev and
Charley" combination, rep-
resenting the minority
leadership in Congress,
and there is Sen. Gold-
water operating on his
own.
There is also a sort of
liberal Republican center,
with Javits of New York
and Case of New Jersey as
spokesmen. There is no
harmony among all these
and a great deal of con-
flict.
What is needed is an al-
ternative philosophy
which requires thought,
concentration and imagi-
nation. It should neither
seek to out promise the
Democrats nor reject all
that has been done in the
last 30 years.
But most of all, there
should be better organi-
zation at all levels.
