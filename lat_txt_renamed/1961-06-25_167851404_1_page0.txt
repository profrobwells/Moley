A TVA for the Pacific Coast?
Any doubt about the de-
termination of the Kenne-
dy administration to use
the cold war threat to
bring American industry
and American life general-
ly into the grip of a vast
federal socialism can be
dissipated by what the ad-
ministration is asking Con-
gress to authorize at the
big atomic installation at
Hanford, Wash.
The Hanford plant was
created for and is being
used in the production of
atomic weapons. In 1958,
Sen. Clinton P. Anderson
asked for and got a $2.5
million appropriation to
provide certain facilities
which at some future time
would enable the heat gen-
erated there to produce
steam for turning turbines,
and thus for the produc-
tion of electric power. This
addition of the $25-million
features makes such a con-
version possible, but at a
very considerable addition-
al cost.

Senators challenged
this, because it suggested
the intention of creating a
power plant at a later date
to enable the federal gov-
ernment to go into compe-
tition with the many in-
vestor-owned companies
which are building new
and improved reactors for
the production of electrici-
ty at their own expense.
But Sen Anderson, then
chairman of the Joint
Committee on Atomic
Energy, reassured them.
He said:
"I want to say, and re-
iterate, that by passage of
the authorization for legis-
lation today we shall not
in any way commit our-
selves ever to convert the
plant. . . we are not con-
sidering current which
would be generated by the
government to put the gov-
ernment into the public
power business as a result
of it."

What has happened now
shows the insubstantial
nature of promises made
by one politician when
another politician comes
along to deal with the
same subject. Brushing
aside the Anderson pledge,
President Kennedy, no
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
doubt advised by Interior
Secretary Udall, is asking
for $60 million to begin
a conversion immediately
which will eventually take
$120 million for the elec-
trical installations at this
plant, on top of the $25
million sought by Ander-
son.
Udall's plans ultimately
will encompass a vast fed-
eral monopoly in electric
power generation and dis-
tribution, from coast to
coast. Such a monster
plant at Hanford would
generate enough power to
supply a city the size of
Los Angeles.
We are told by Udall,
who seems to be more
eager to socialize electric
power than was his prede-
cessor, Harold Ickes, that
the $60 million is to pre-
vent the waste of the $25
million already spent.
Thus when you give social-
ism an inch, it next takes
a mile.
Rep. Craig Hosmer of
California, who over the
years has been one of the
best informed members of
Congress on reclamation
and power development,
has challenged the new ex-
penditure on the ground
that it would create a huge
federal investment in a
type of production which
will be obsolete after pri-
vate companies have com-
pleted their experiments
on reactors which are bet-
ter suited to produce elec-
tric power. It would also
create the first vast block
of electric power federally
generated by steam out-
side the Tennessee Valley.
Hosmer submitted in-
quiries to 25 of our fore-
most nuclear experts in the
universities and in indus-
try. Two-thirds of those re-
plying could see no sub-
stantial contribution
to civilian technology, and
85% indicated that the
money asked for could bet-
ter be spent on a variety
of other experimental proj-
ects.

The issue really comes
down to the intention of
the Kennedy administra-
tion to move the govern-
ment deeply into the pow-
er business, to thrust its
competitive nose into areas
far from Hanford, notably
into the rich commercial
market of Southern Cali-
fornia.
But to create a govern-
ment monopoly in a field
in which the public is al-
ready well served by pri-
vate industry will not add
to our security, but will
undermine the real basis
of our economic strength
and prestige.
It is not important in the
cold war what our govern-
ment does in the way of so-
cialized industry. Socialist
Russia specializes in that.
It is the production of our
industry which challenges
the interest and admira-
tion of the world.
