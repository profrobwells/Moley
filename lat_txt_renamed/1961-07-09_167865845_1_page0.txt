Devastating Report Tells Waste
in Federal School 'Aid' Spending
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Inasmuch as the federal
hureaucracy has been in-
competent in administer-
ing the millions already
given for school aid, it
would seem to have colos-
sal nerve to come before
Congress with a demand to
administer the billions in-
volved in the plan now
pending in the House of
Representatives.
One of the arguments
for federal school aid is
that the federal govern-
ment will be more efficient
in spending dollars than
the various states and dis-
tricts now responsible. Let
us see how the federal gov-
ernment has been spend-
ing our money for limited
school aid through the De-
partment of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare and its
Office of Education.
*
The officer responsible
for checking federal pro-
grams, the Comptrol-
ler General of the United
States, issued a devastat-
ing report on this subject
on June 12 of this year. It
certainly denied any fed-
eral claim to superior wis-
dom and efficiency in
spending funds.
More than 10 years ago,
the 81st Congress enacted
a law, amended several
times since, to provide as-
sistance to school districts
which, under the defense
effort, have been required
to care for more than a
normal number of school
children. This program is
called "School Assistance
in Federally Affected
Areas."
*
The pertinent language
in the law states that mon-
etary grants shall be made
to such school districts
based upon the following
requirement:
The estimated in-
crease, since the base
year, in the number of
children whose member-
ship results directly from
activities of the United
States (carried on either
directly or through a con-
tractor)."
Since 1950, $948 million
has been spent under this
legislation.
The spending of this
money has been entrusted
to the Office of Education
under the various commis-
sioners since 1950. To op-
erate this program, the
various regional offices of
the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare
were the centers of the Ofi-
fice of Education's activity.
These offices are in Bos-
ton, New York, Charlottes-
ville, Atlanta, Chicago,
Kansas City, Dallas, Den-
ver, and San Francisco.
The Comptroller Gen-
eral found after examina-
tion that the instructions
issued were so loose that
data submitted by dis-
tricts applying for aid
were considered sufficient,
with little or no independ-
ent checking.
Companies having de-
fense or government con-
tracts were supposed to
provide an indication of
the extent to which chil-
dren of parents employed
by such companies were
to be the beneficiaries.
But the statements of the
number of employees pro-
vided by school districts
were accepted as ade-
quate evidence of need.
Under this practice, all
the children of all em-
ployees of companies
which had only minor fed-
eral contracts were count-
ed as an abnormal addi-
tion to the school load.
*
• It would seem that
prudent administration of
such large sums would
take into consideration
the increase in the num-
ber of children of em-
ployees directly con-
cerned with the propor-
tion of federal business
done by that company.
But this was not done.
The report of the Comp-
troller General says that
the Office of Education's
instructions "did not in-
clude guides or standards
to assist the field repre-
sentatives to arrive at ap-
propriate conclusions."
The Comptroller Gen-
eral's report says also that
"no instructions (were)
provided to the school dis-
tricts on how to determine
that industries or instal-
lations were engaged in
federal activities directly
or through a contractor.
"There was no guide giv-
en as to the types of goods
or materials produced or
sold by contractors that
would qualify them as de-
fense piants. There was
no definition of 'federal
activity."
This program is up for
more money now and is
tied in with the rest of
the school aid plans.
★
The cynical move of
this administration to
pressure members of the
House to vote for all
school aid is shown by a
release of figures showing
which Congressmen's dis-
tricts got some of this
loosely spent money. The
release shows 313 mem-
bers' districts, with the
amounts charged against
each. There figures apply
specifically to the districts
represented by members
of the Rules Committee,
which is presently holding
up the whole batch of
school-aid plans.
In short, the adminis-
tration is saying, "Vote
for what we want, be-
cause look at what we
have given your districts
all these years."
