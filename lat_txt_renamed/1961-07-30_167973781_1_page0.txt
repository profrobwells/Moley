President Kennedy's Tender Skin
It may he because of
President Kennedy's pre-
occupation with what he
calls an "image" that he
has been so intensely con-
cerned about what the
press writes about him,
his public and private ac-
tivities, and his adminis-
tration generally.
At times this concern
reaches a high degree of
sensitivity, often manifest-
ing itself in personal con-
tacts with correspondents
and authors to explain, re-
prove, or argue about
items which have ap-
peared in print.
As one correspondent
has put it, the President
tends to classify members
of the press as being "for"
or "against" him.
This diversion not only
consumes precious time
taken from profoundly im-
portant official decision-
making; it is on the whole
futile.
In varying degrees, how-
ever, this has been true
of some Presidents in the
past, individuals whom
Mr. Kennedy has highly
praised at various times in
his career. Andrew Jack-
son roundly castigated his
critics and, as a means of
creating a more favorable
"image," used his famous
"Kitchen Cabinet" in
which editors were promi-
nent members. This may
have been the first public
relations organization in
Washington.
Lincoln generally ig-
nored criticism, although
he replied in a long and
famous letter to Horace
Greeley's demands in the
New York Tribune for ac-
tion toward freeing the
slaves. Theodore Roose-
velt created his "Ananias
Club," and before he left
the White House he
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
reached a point of open
warfare with many cor-
respondents.
When Franklin D.
Roosevelt reached the
White House, an official
press secretary had come
to be one of the Presi-
dent's staff, in this in-
stance, the late Stephen
Moley
Early, the ablest and most
respected of all who have
carried that title.
But Early's job was a
difficult one. For the ca-
pricious changes in poli-
cy, the mercurial tempera-
ment of the chief, and the
increasing number of cor-
respondents provided a
formidable task.
Early's concept of his
job proved to be highly
successful. On the one
hand, he became the
means by which the press
could understand what the
President was doing and,
on the other hand, he
served to interpret to the
impatient President the
problems and perplexities
of the newsmen. There
were times, however,
when Early's difficulties
seemed insurmountable.
Mr. Roosevelt usually
kept to his bed for an hour
or so after breakfast.
Among other tasks, he at-
tempted to read several
morning newspapers. In-
variably there was some-
thing in them that greatly
irritated him. Sometimes
he would scribble a state-
ment answering such
items on notepaper, and
when Early appeared the
President would say,
"Give this out as a state-
ment."
Early would take the
statement without com-
ment, and then consign it
to the oblivion of his
pocket. By 11 o'clock the
President, immersed in
many other affairs, would
forget all about the state-
ment and it never saw
light.
One morning I was pres-
ent during the daily out-
burst and left with Early.
Steve, who had a temper
of his own but knew how
to control it, said, "I real-
ly don't know how much
longer I can take this. It
happens almost every
day."
But Early went on for
years patiently suppress-
ing Presidential outbursts.
This was an unmitigated
benefit to the President
and to the country.
For the most part, wise
Presidents calmly go on
without comment on what
is said about them. They
can always deny that they
have read any particular
item in the press. And
they realize that for the
most part what is written
will be soon forgotten or
that the reply will appear
in deeds, not words.
But if a President at-
tempts to reply in person
to criticism, he must of
necessity fail. For there is
only one President, and
there are thousands of po-
tential critics. Preponder-
ance of numbers will de-
cide the issue.
