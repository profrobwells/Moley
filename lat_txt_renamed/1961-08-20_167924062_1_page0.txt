Too Many Eggs in School Basket
At the summit of Rem-
brandt van Rijn's career
he found himself pos-
sessed of a large mansion,
a vast collection of objects
of art, and numerous cred-
itors. Hard times in the
Netherlands made money
tight; new commissions
for paintings were scarce,
and the master had many
enemies.
As the net tightened
around him, Rembrandt
ignored the sensible
course of selling a Rubens
or a piece of rare porce-
lain or jewelry, but held
tenaciously to everything
he had. The result was
legal action which lost
him everything but his
family and what he could
wear and carry with him
to a miserable inn.

The Kennedy strategy
on aid-to-education was
based upon a package of
projects which he he-
lieved would enlist the
support of so many inter-
ests that nothing could
fail. But there proved to
be more and varied points
of opposition than there
were favorable interests.
And so the whole thing has
apparently foundered,
good things and bad in
one total disaster.
No doubt, the religious
issue was a finally deter-
mining factor in the de-
feat. But beneath that
there were grave doubts
in many members of the
House- doubts rooted in
distrust of the claimed
need for most of the items
in the omnibus proposal
and in the figures in sup-
port compiled by the Of-
fice of Education. They
also questioned whether
federal aid would not
mean federal control.

There is also a rising
tide of conservatism
among Republicans in the
House, stimulated by let-
ters from home. When
there was a Republican
President who wanted
school aid, these members
felt an obligation to sup-
port him. But now they
are free to follow their
own inclinations. And
there is the practical mo-
tive of an opposition to the
wishes of a Democratic
President in matters not
involving national defense.
They don't want President
Kennedy to succeed in
passing aid which Presi-
dent Eisenhower failed to
secure.
Now that there is a
breathing spell, there is
time for a more rational
approach, free of politics
and emotionalism. Demo-
crats can join in such an
effort, now that they have
toiled valiantly to make
good the Los Angeles
platform and the prom-
ises of candidate Kenne-
dy. They can say that
they did their durndest.
Surely in the two
houses of Congress there
are enough intelligence
and imagination to con-
trive a means by which
aid can be supplied to
meet genuinely demon-
strated need without the
federal control which
both parties, sincerely or
not, loudly oppose.
The federal govern-
ment can take certain
steps to provide more
money for education with-
out any danger of control.
There can be tax credits
for those who pay local
taxes for schools. The fed-
eral tax can be removed
on certain sources which
could then be used by the
states and local govern-
ments. Parents with chil-
dren of college age can be
permitted a credit on
their federal income tax
to help their own children
continue their education.
School administrators
can bring some adminis-
trative talent and magi-
nation to bear in length-
ening the school year and
thus providing a more ef-
ficient use of facilities
and more pay for teach-
ers. They can also excise
a lot of frills from their
curricula and their build-
ing plans. Colleges can,
according to many en-
lightened college and uni-
versity presidents, reduce
the traditional and unnec-
essary four years to three.
There can be an elimina-
tion of unnecessary
courses,
State and local govern-
ments can and now must
forget about the cuts they
were planning if Uncle
Sam came in with help
in their appropriations for
education. The federal
government can help im-
pacted areas by paying
taxes at the local going
rate on the vast areas
they have taken off local
tax rolls.

I simply do not believe
there are as many young
men and women who
want to go to college and
have not the means as are
claimed by the President
and Secretary Ribicoff.
Many colleges have schol-
arships for gifted appli-
cants â€” funds which are
going begging. Private
philanthropy, especially
the big foundations, can
supply thousands of schol-
arships if they eliminate
some of the nonsense
which they are now sup-
porting.
There is enough money
in the United States for
education. But it need not
be channeled and con-
trolled by a federal bu-
reaucracy. Let us now
have a reasonable ap-
proach to the whole sub-
ject.
