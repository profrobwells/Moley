Dangerous Gabble at the Brink
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The only conclusion
that the Kremlin can draw
from the confusion of
many administration
voices announcing
foreign policy is that the
President has no clear
idea of what his policies
are.
That is the same conclusion
that Americans
can draw. For almost every
day some functionary
is reported in the press
with some new judgment
on this or that aspect of
international policy. The
great peril in this is that
either the West Germans
or someone else on the
far periphery of the free
world, or the Soviet government,
through miscalculation,
will precipitate a
devastating war.
*
Where, in all this confusion,
are the traditions
which have served us well
in the years since Jefferson
took over the new
State Department under
President Washington?
The tested and proved
tradition is that the President
and the secretary of
state together make the
vital decisions, and either
the President or the secretary
of state announces
them. A bit of reflection
can indicate to anyone
that such a procedure is
the only one which can
possibly be workable.
Let us consider on that
background what is happening
now. The President
himself has established
a sort of foreign
ministry of his own in his
executive office. Four or
five alleged experts on
international affairs are
there, each anxious to announce
or leak to favored
newspaper correspondents
his own pet notions
concerning Berlin or Africa
or Red China or Latin
America, or some other
acute area.
Then there is a secretary
of state, Dean Rusk,
who has a whole army of
advisers under his nominal
jurisdiction. There is
Adlai Stevenson at the
United Nations, following
his life-long habit of making
pretty speeches on every
possible occasion.
There is also Sen. Fulbright
uttering his dissents
from both the President
and Rusk. There is
Secretary of the Treasury
Dillon and his lavish
promises in Latin America.
There are also Gen.
Taylor, and Bohlen and
Harriman, as well as G.
Mennen Williams and
Robert Kennedy. Finally,
there is ex-Secretary of
State Dean Acheson, giving
advice to the President
and almost everybody
else about what
should be done.
Under Secretary Chester
Bowles, whose job
should be that of the
anonymous manager of a
huge bureaucracy, conceives
himself to be another
oracle and spokesman.
After the President
got him off a hot spot by
sending him somewhere
abroad to quiet him for a
while, Bowles took the
first opportunity to sound
off at the Press Club in
Washington.
And only recently Secretary
Udall got into the
act with an essay on international
oil policy by a
subordinate which runs
dangerously counter to
the interests of our European
friends and of the
Arab states.
*
Where, amid all this, is
the man who is vested
with the high distinction
of secretary of state, Mr.
Rusk? If he thinks at all
or has read history a bit,
he must know what anyone
of the great secretaries
of state might have
done in this instance â€”
John Quincy Adams,
Webster, Seward, Blaine,
Hay, Root, Hughes, Dulles.
Any one of them
would have resigned
when, as is apparent in
this case, the President
had something less than
complete confidence in
him. But in those instances
there was full rapport.
In some instances the
President accepted the
secretary's leadership. In
other instances the President
took the lead. That
is as it was with Wilson
and Roosevelt. But in
the latter case, as Secretary
Hull's memoirs show,
the tendency of the President
to detour around him
by consulting some other
official was exceedingly
irksome.
*
I have nothing but a
superficial knowledge of
what sort of individual
Dean Rusk is. Perhaps he
is possessed of a master
mind. His former presidency
of the Rockefeller
Foundation proves nothing.
For a dwarf behind
the Rockefeller millions
would receive adulation
and flattering notices. But
to endure this situation, in
which the higher honor of
his office is small compensation
for the humiliation
of being only one of many,
is a mark either of weakness
or of patience beyond
compare.
On the other hand, the
President, by creating
this confusion, is revealing
to the world that he
has few fixed convictions
and no specific foreign
policy. Foreign policy cannot
be determined by a
town meeting of advisers.
