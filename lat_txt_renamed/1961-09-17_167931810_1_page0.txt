Economic Crystal Gazers Useless
Back in 1945, when the
end of the war was clearly
in sight, three liberal sen-
ators brought before Con-
gress a measure called
the Full Employment Bill.
At that time, in an article
to which I gave the title
"A Fool Employment
Bill," I made this com-
ment:
"It is a legislative mon-
strosity. The thin body
is a measure for gather-
ing statistics but the
thick head is a preten-
tious and sophomoric pro-
posal to create a new Uto-
pia."
The meat of the bill's
preamble was this:
"To the extent that con-
tinuing full employment
cannot otherwise be
achieved, it is the further
responsibility of the fed-
eral government to pro-
vide such volume of feder-
al investment and expendi-
ture as may be needed to
assure continuing full em-
ployment."
Under the terms of the
bill there was to be an
agency with clairvoyant
capacities to tell the Pres-
ident exactly what would
he needed for the pur-
pose, and then he was to
submit a budget with the
required "investment and
expenditures."
Even in the dark war
years it should have been
known that federal spend-
ing cannot take hold
quickly enough to assure
immediate effects up-
on the economy. That was
proved back in 1933
when the first spending-
for-employment measure
was passed.
Also, the goal of "full"
employment cannot be as-
sured at any time, under
any conditions, except in
war. Of the $3 billion au-
thorized in 1933 for pub-
lic works, only about 3%
had actually been spent
at the end of a year.
And there was no re-
duction in unemployment
in all the remaining years
before 1940 that could
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
have been traced to gov-
ernment spending.
Fortunately, Sen. Taft
attacked the original full
employment bill with
such force and authority
that the monster was re-
duced to what seemed
was in essence another
harmless (and, as it has
proved, useless) bureau
Heller
under the President called
the Council of Economic
Advisers.
On the basis of its fact-
gathering the President
issues an economic mes-
sage. And there is a con-
gressional Joint Economic
Committee with a staff
which issues another eco-
nomic report. About the
only employment provided
is the addition of a few
more economists and
clerks to the vast army of
economists scattered all
over Washington.
In adopting the skele-
ton to which Taft reduced
the original bill, Congress,
as is so often the case,
imposed an impossible
task upon a new bureauc-
racy. That task is to look
into a crystal ball of fig-
ures and foretell the fu-
ture.
In the last few years the
reports of the President
and of the joint committee
have conflicted with each
other. That has been be-
cause the President was
Republican and the joint
committee Democratic.
No one can blame a few
mortal men for failing to
achieve the status of seers
and prophets. The blame
rests with Congress for
vesting such a job in any
bureau or bureaus.
The reports of the Pres-
ident's Council of Econom-
ic Advisers are discussions
of economic conditions
such as are issued by
banks and economic serv-
ices of all sorts. The sta-
tistics are repetitions of
tables which are available
in many other annual sur-
veys, such as the Econom-
ic Almanac of the Nation-
al Industrial Conference
Board.
The whole thing is harm-
less but useless. There is
no need for a "council."
And there is need for only
a small staff, since the nec-
essary figures are availa-
ble from government de-
partments already in ex-
istence.
I grant that it is fine
to have at the President's
side a good economist to
provide him and the pub-
lic with advice and infor-
mation. Drs. Arthur Burns
and Raymond Saulnier
were most useful.
But unlike Dr. Walter
W. Heller, they did not
pose as prophets. Dr. Hel-
ler is not satisfied with
their humble role. By im-
posing upon himself the
mantle of prophecy, Hel-
ler has assumed that he
must tell not only what
will happen but what
ought to happen.
Recently, he has been
telling the steel industry
that it can provide wage
increases without raising
prices.
This is probably the nat-
ural outcome of an organ-
ization which has been
given an impossible task
by a thoughtless Congress.
My suggestion that the
Council of Economic Ad-
visers be eliminated to
save a little taxpayers'
money is not a prophecy.
It will not be abolished.
For a bureau, once creat-
ed, is about the only thing
in our civilization that en-
joys immortal life.
