Ribicoff Tangles With
Washington Red Tape
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the pale shad-
ows cast by most of Presi-
dent Kennedy's Cabinet
members, that of Secre-
tary Abraham Ribicoff be-
gins to assume a certain
firmness.
Three recent pieces of
news about him are com-
mendable.
He has made some plain
statements to the educa-
tors of the country that
they had better get their
educational establish-
ments in better order.
*
Several weeks ago he is-
sued a directive which
highlighted one of the
great evils in our sprawl-
ing federal bureaucracy.
It is a matter of fairly
general knowledge that a
big government bureauc-
racy is infested with sus-
picions, jealousies, and
spying. In Ribicoff's De-
partment of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare there
had been installed during
its relatively short life of
eight years no less than
400 devices which moni-
tored or provided means of
listening in on the tele-
phones of employees.
*
Under date of Sept. 29
Ribicoff ordered that all
the listening devices
should be removed and
that no new ones should
be installed.
It must have been a sur-
prise to the President when
Ribicoff responded to the
call for economy by an-
nouncing that he intended
to cut spending in his de-
partment $101,945,000 be-
low the appropriations
made by Congress.
And it must have
seemed to the bureaucrats
in the department to be
something like the black
plague. For it meant elim-
inating the need for 627
new jobs.
*
There is an interesting
story behind this cut.
In the secretary's esti-
mates of his department's
needs, he asked for $695
million for the National
Institute of Health. The
President's Budget Bu-
reau reduced that amount
to $583 million. But in
the Senate Committee on
Labor and Public Welfare
the amount was raised to
$835 million.
★
Then Sen. Bush protest-
ed that the committee fig-
ure was more than the in-
stitute believed it could
spend. He offered an
amendment to cut the
amount back to the figure
asked for by Ribicoff's de-
partment.
Chairman Hill vigorous-
ly protested, apparently
on the ground that if a
little health is a good
thing, why not have a lot
more. He was supported
by Sen. Gruening, who of-
fered the moving but ir-
relevant fact that seven
senators had died of can-
cer.
The Bush amendment
was defeated by a vote of
53 to 39.
In the final House-Sen-
ate conference, the figure
of $738 million was agreed
upon. Thus the institute
had an appropriation
which was $43 million
more than it had said it
could possibly spend.
In Ribicoff's economy
move, $60 million was cut
from the institute's avail-
able funds.
These two accounts, the
one dealing with the bu-
reaucracy and the other
with Congress, illustrate
the position in which even
a capable and conscien-
tious cabinet officer finds
himself.
★
To a large degree the
secretary of a department
is a prisoner of his own
bureaucracy. In Ribi-
coff's case his employees
number more than 70,000
-a rise from 35,000 when
the department was estab-
lished in 1953.
The secretary must de-
pend upon them for in-
formation. He finds it al-
most impossible to remove
them because of Civil
Service security.
Also, Congress, in pur-
suit of political advantage,
dumps more and more re-
sponsibilities on the bu-
reaucracy, along with
more and more money.
The result is what we
have — an irresponsible
bureaucracy on one hand
and an irresponsible Con-
gress on the other.
