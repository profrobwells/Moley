Bossism Shifts From
Cities to White House
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

And so, with simple in-
formality, the President of
the United States has be-
stowed upon Mayor Wag-
ner, just re-elected mayor
of New York City, the
custody of the federal
plum tree in New York
State.

This designation, with
the rich treasure which it
implies, is the most recent
of the evidences of the
passing of an ancient or-
der. Bossism has passed
from the district clubs to
the White House.

In commenting upon the
feudal character of the
Tammany Hall of some
years ago, a professor at
Fordham University once
told me that his researches
in Irish history had given
him the key to the singu-
lar nature of American
political machines. He said
that in the evolution of the
Irish people over the cen-
turies, one important
phase had been skipped.

There were the ancient
kings, several of them, at
the time of St. Patrick.
Then came the English,
and finally, after a long
period of unhappy servi-
tude and exploitation, an
Irish nationality emerged
in the 19th century. There
was no intermediary peri-
od of feudalism, as was the
case in England.

I shall leave the de-
termination of the accu-
racy of this historical fact
to the disputations of
scholars. But it is true that
when the Irish immigrants
came over and settled in
New York, they quickly
established a feudal re-
gime under the name of
the Tammany society.

Earlier arrivals became
the liege lords, giving ben-
efits and receiving obedi-
ent service. The leaders,
or as reformers have it
now, the "bosses," pro-
vided guidance for the
newly arrived, fed the
hungry, supplied housing
for the homeless, dis-
pensed jobs and, when the
law intervened, seasoned
justice with a word to the
judge. The leaders saw to
the details of naturaliza-
tion through co-operating
judges and clerks. And all

that the beneficiaries gave
in return were their votes.
And so it was for more
than a century.

Slowly at first, and then
with a quickened tempo
during the New Deal
years, federal government
welfarism took over the
job of caring for the needy
and of dispensing con-

Wagner

tracts and favors. The
bosses' range of disposable
favors contracted.

Their resources could
not keep pace with gov-
ernment revenues exacted
from all taxpayers. The
prestige of the Tammany
Society, founded in 1789,
shrank with the circum-
vention of its leaders' pow-
er.

First its famous hall on
14th St. was abandoned
and a new hall was taken
a few blocks up town.
Then, a few weeks ago, it
was announced that the
Manhattan organization
had moved to a few hotel
rooms in midtown. Even
the name has been dropped
and a new name was tak-
en from, of all people, a
British statesman. It is
now Chatham Hall.

There will be many who
regret the passing of this
venerable institution.
They will recall the many
lusty victory celebrations
in the old hall.

All this has happened in
the name of reform. Votes
will still be won by favors
and loyalty by the pres-
sure of power.

Perhaps the antiseptic
bureaucracy that puts the
coal in the widow's bin is
an improvement. The su-
per-boss is in Washington;
the benefactor, a vague,
impersonal power called
government. But the old
order was interesting —
while it lasted.
