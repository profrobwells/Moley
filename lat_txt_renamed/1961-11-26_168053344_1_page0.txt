Civic Pride Comes High
in Trinity Mountains
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those lovers of nature
who have traveled to the
splendid redwood forest in
Humboldt County in
Northern California, and
have cast their eyes to the
east through a chink
among the trees, have seen
there the rugged heights
of what are known as the
Trinity Alps.
Those mountains are
largely in Trinity County.
The only passable highway
into that area from the
west is from Eureka, on
the coast, along the Trini-
tv River. Half way to the
central valley, on that
highway, there is the small
city of Weaverville.
â˜…
Not far from there is the
site of the Trinity Dam.
The building of that dam
was the subject of some
controversy a few years
ago when the Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. failed in
its effort to spend its own
money to build it. Federal
bureaucrats and official
public power people in-
sisted that the federal go-
ernment foot the bill.
Now the dam is nearing
completion and Washing-
ton's bureaucracy assumes
that Weaverville will be a
depressed area needing
more federal money to es-
cape the fate of a ghost
town. And so, after the
great New Frontier victo-
ry in passing the depressed
areas bill with an appro-
priation of $400 million,
some federal bureaucrats
visited Trinity County and
decided that federal mon-
ey should be used to keep
Weaverville un-depressed.
Therefore, recently
Weaverville's newspaper,
the weekly Trinity Jour-
nal, received exultant tele-
grams from Sen. Kuchel
and Engel and from the
district's congressman,
saying that Washington
had decided that the city
was depressed and that
money was on the way to
save it.
*
Instead of dancing in
the streets, the people of
the city were enraged. In
an editorial in the Journal
entitled "Lie Down and
Be Depressed, Damn You."
the Journal told the story.
It said that Weaverville
wanted no federal money
and that it was doing
quite well, thank you.
The manager of the
bank reported deposits at
an all-time high. A new
super-market is to open
soon, and the area can use
and support several new
businesses based upon pri-
vate funds.
The editorial continues:
"But someone has con-
cluded that this prosperity
means nothing, that the
county should come to the
feds, hat in hand and pen-
cils for sale.
Big Broth-
er is watching us, all
right, but he's myopic."
There are three lessons
Engle
to be drawn from this bu-
reaucratic and congres-
sional imbecility.
One is that it is a clear
confession that when fed-
eral money goes into an
area an expectation is es-
tablished in the minds of
bureaucrats that the re-
lief is only temporary and
must be followed by con-
tinuous federal grants
thereafter.
*
Another lesson is that
the New Frontier is in
such a hurry to spend the
depressed areas appropria-
tion that no real examina-
tion of the attitude of the
designated areas them-
selves is made before it de-
cides to pour in money.
Finally, if the federal
government and the puh-
lic power politicians had
not insisted-with a strong
assist from California's
liberal Republican Sen.
Kuchel on spending its
own money for the Trinity
Dam, the PG&E would
have built the dam with
private money.
Moreover, if the PG&E
had made this investment,
Trinity County would have
been able to tax the prop-
erty and thus have plenty
of income for its needs.
Thus the federal gov-
ernment first takes away a
large tax source from a lo-
cal area and then rushes
in with a further handout
to help keep it prosper-
ous. In this case, the mon-
ey was neither needed nor
wanted.
