U.N. May Be on Wrong
Road to Peace in Congo
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The disenchantment felt
by so many Americans in
the United Nations will
certainly be heightened by
its blundering conduct in
the Congo.
This U.N. Congo policy,
which the United States
seems to have sanctioned,
began with a false assumption.
It assumed that a certain
vast area in Africa which
the Belgians had taken in
the great colonial game of
grabs possesses the elements
of unity essential to the
creation of a viable nation.
In the age of colonization
there were roughly marked
out areas mutually recognized
by European nations as
spheres of influence, exploitation
and development.
The vast Congo area was
Belgium’s.
*
But included in the area
was a region quite different
in nature from the wild
jungle in the north along
the Congo River and endowed
with a more tolerable climate
and rich mineral resources.
That is Katanga.
White people were drawn
there because of its riches,
its climate, and its closeness
to the British to the south.
All of its interests were
quite foreign to the valley
of the Congo in the north.
A species of European civilization
grew there because of the
white settlers.
European capital moved in.
Finally, in the great recent
wave of awakening nationalities,
a native leader appeared in
the person of Moise Tshombe,
an educated man familiar
with European customs and
traditions.
He has been a powerful
factor in creating tolerable
relations between the white
and black populations of the
area. He is strongly anti-Communist.
His capital is Elisabethville,
close to the border of Rhodesia
and 1,200 miles from Leopoldville.
He has been seeking detachment
from the Communist-infiltrated
and unhappy “government” in
the north.

But the United Nations
determined from the first
that, since the Belgians had
called the entire area a unified
whole for reasons of their
own, Katanga should be absorbed
into the larger northern area.
And so the United Nations
moved in with hired military
forces, an overwhelming number
of which are Indians and Gurkhas.
The leaders of Katanga
hate those Indians not only
because they are alien in race
and religion to the people in
Katanga, but because they fear
that Nehru has designs upon
their “province” as a place for
Indian colonization and exploitation.

Thus the U.N. intervention
is not just a band of freedom
lovers and liberators, but is
actuated by the same motives
which characterized earlier colonialism.
The people of Katanga also
fear domination by communism
which, considering the character
of the northern government, is
a fear well founded.
Those in the United Nations
who promoted this intervention
fail to realize that history shows
that a nation is not created by
outside coercion. The Congo is
not a nation merely because a
resolution of the United Nations
says it is. Nor is it created by
force of U.N. arms.
The folly and mischief of
the intervention are confessed
in the very semantics used — a
semantic jargon largely adopted
in news reports reaching us from
the area.
The white people who are in
Katanga’s defense are “mercenaries.”
But what of the hired U.N.
troops, especially the savage
Gurkhas traditionally employed
for the dirty business of war by
whoever can afford them? What
of our own military advisers in
many countries?
As one informed observer has
said, “One man’s military technician
becomes another man’s mercenary.”
★
Contemptuous comments are
made concerning British, French
and Belgian “capitalist interests”
in the vast riches of cobalt and
uranium. How does this jibe
with our official encouragement
of “investments” in helping to
develop emerging nations?
No doubt with the intention
of exciting American recollections
of 1861, Katanga’s resistance
to absorption is called “secession.”
But true secession occurs when
a part of a nation detaches itself
from a long and firm membership
in a political union. Did the
United Nations send in troops
when Syria detached itself from
the United Arab Republic?
The consequences of a military
suppression of Katanga seem to
have been ignored by the promoters
of intervention. Either there will
be chaos for years, or Communist
domination of all the Congo, including
Katanga.
★
Thus the Soviet Union would
have access to the very mineral
resources of uranium which we
used in creating the atomic bomb.
Finally, there is the damage to
our relations with our best friends,
Britain and France, who are viewing
this folly with fear and distaste.
The loss of the Congo to the
free world may well be another
China affair.
And for such a result this
administration should bear a large
share of the responsibility.
