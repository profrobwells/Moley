Better System Needed
for Political Support
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may seem strange to
dedicate an article to a
subject which seems as re-
mote from the spirit of
Christmas giving as the
support of political parties.
The air and the mail are
full of appeals these days
for financial support for
hospitals, schools, and in-
numerable charities.
This is to suggest that
the liberty we enjoy to
give as well as receive is
dependent upon the main-
tenance of a government
which is responsive to the
public demands and politi-
cal restraints.
*
The firmest assurance
that we shall have such a
liberty-protecting govern-
ment depends upon a
strong and healthy two-
party system.
The soundness of our
two parties depends upon
an adequate amount of
money for their support.
Their health is just as
important a matter as is
ridding us of disease,
delinquency, and involun-
tary poverty.
The character of a polit-
ical party depends upon
the breadth of its base.
To expect a party to serve
the public rather than the
private interest of a few,
when its financial support
is narrowly based, is to
blind ourselves to what we
all know of human nature.
*
When we scan the list of
contributors after any
campaign, there appears
the melancholy, not to say
frightening, fact that both
of our parties rest upon
the support of a very few
major contributors.
The Republican Party
must, if it is to survive,
reach into the pockets of
a relatively few "fat cats"
for the major part of its
financial support.
This not only is detri-
mental to the public in-
terest, but it is unfair to
the contributors them-
selves. For the opposition
can point to those individ-
uals as undesirable citi-
zens who seek by lavish
gifts to buy favor.
On the other hand, the
contributions to the Demo-
cratic Party and its candi-
dates have become alto-
gether heavily weighted
by special groups, notably
the labor unions. It is true
that there is federal legis-
lation forbidding this. But
it is applicable only to the
nomination and election of
federal officers.
All other elections, ex-
cept where there are state
laws forbidding it, may be
financed by the labor or-
ganizations them-
selves. The Republicans
can and do excoriate the
Democrats for this labor
support.
To avoid such accusa-
tions, dozens of commit-
tees are formed for this
or that candidate or party,
and thus there are split
contributions, all of which
go to the same end.
Two ways have been
suggested to provide a
broader base by law for
contributions and to re-
lieve the two parties from
obligations which now
prevail.
*
One would be to have
Congress appropriate sub-
sidies to the parties. But
this is not only impracti-
cal but undesirable.
Such subsidies would
presumably apply only to
the nomination and elec-
tion of candidates for fed-
eral offices. And the enact-
ment of such subsidies by
Congress would involve
partisan bickering and
also create bureaucratic
control.
The best way to broad-
en the base of both par-
ties would be through the
incentive now in opera-
tion to encourage contri-
butions for charitable and
civic purposes. That would
be by an enactment of
Congress of a provision to
allow a deduction or a
credit in income tax re-
turns of a limited amount
as a contribution to the
individual's party of
choice.
*
I like best a suggestion
made by a distinguished
New York lawyer and ju-
rist who served on the fed-
eral bench for some years
before resuming private
practice. He is Simon H.
Rifkind.
He suggests that a tax
credit of $10 be allowed
for party contributions.
But since he believes,
quite correctly, that the
return would not be great
enough from these small
contributions, there
should be allowed a credit
against "income" (mean-
ing a deduction rather
than a tax credit) up to an
aggregate of $3,000.
