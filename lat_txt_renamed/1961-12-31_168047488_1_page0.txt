More Capital Needed
to Boost U.S. Economy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the campaign of 1960,
John F. Kennedy made a
major issue of the slow
growth of the national
economy. Since everyone
wants growth, his indict-
ment had a very consider-
able effect upon the Amer-
ican public.
But Mr. Kennedy, like
all his liberal associates,
proposed as remedies more
of the very same deter-
rents which have caused
the deficiency. His remedy,
following the pamphlet-
eering of Prof. Galbraith
and others, was to exact
more from what is called
the private sector of the
economy and greater
spending by government
in the public sector.
The economic thinking
which has had so much
influence in shaping gov-
ernment policies, especially
those which have had
the support of the present-
ly dominant liberal ma-
jority of the Democratic
Party, is not new. It origi-
nated in the late 1930's.

This was the notion that
our economy had become
stagnant, that private sav-
ings were an unmitigated
evil — indeed, that such
savings were "anti-social"
—that the way to get mon-
ey "moving" was to take
it away from thrifty—to
the liberals "misguided"—
individuals, and spend it
through the government.
This concept lingered on
into the neo-New Deal
which now dominates our
government.
Let us assume that we
all believe in a capitalist
economy. None of the lib-
erals at any rate will admit
that they want to abolish
capitalism. Then we must
look to the formation of
capital.
That indispensable ele-
ment is created in the
amount of our income that
we do not spend for our
current needs. With at-
tractive interest rates, it is
then invested. The result
is the creation of capital
goods, and these in turn
create a larger and more
productive economy, with
more employment and
more income for all.
On the basis of that as-
sumption, the National Bu-
reau of Economic Research
began a series of studies
of capital formation in the
United States. The final
and summary study has
just been published. It is
called "Capital in the
American Economy," and
its author is Simon Kuz-
nets, who is a professor of
economics at Harvard.
He finds, after a study
of capital formation in the
United States over a pe-
riod of 58 years, that it has
been checked by the limit-
ed availability of savings.
The ratio of personal
savings to national prod-
uct has declined. It aver-
aged 5.3% in 1939-1941
and 4.8% in 1948-1957.
Meanwhile, the need for
more capital is mounting
and will mount, Kuznets
says, for years to come.
This is because of the
large growth of the popu-
lation in certain strategic
age groups, the accelerated
rate of technological
change, and continued
pressure on our economy
because of international
tensions. Investment capi-
tal will also be endangered
by inflationary pressures.
These studies are factu-
al and, of course, non-
political. But since the re-
pressive forces on the ac-
cumulation of savings are
obvious to the lay mind,
the following cannot but
be the factors behind the
decline in capital forma-
tion.
They are: the preoccu-
pation of so many Ameri-
cans with consumer goods,
the drying up of potential
investment funds by ex-
cessive income taxes in the
higher brackets, the pres-
sure on corporate earnings
by a high corporate in-
come tax, the unneces-
sarily tight restrictions on
depreciation allowances,
and inflation.
Of the foregoing five
causes, responsibility for
all except the first lies
upon the government and
its tax laws, its spending
habits, and the administra-
tion of the law.
The preoccupation with
consumer goods may or
may not be accelerated by
the urge of individuals to
get rid of their money to
escape inflation. But its
remedy is certainly not
Galbraith's prescription to
take more away in taxes
for the purpose of govern-
ment spending.

Those who suggest low-
ering the rates on high in-
comes or cutting the rates
on corporations or provid-
ing more liberal allow-
ances for depreciation
meet the taunt of liberals
that they are trying to
help the rich get richer.
Also, that the liberals and
the liberals alone are con-
cerned about "the little fel-
low."
But the liberals fail to
see that in our nation
and our national economy
neither the big fellow, nor
the corporation, nor the
little fellow is "an island,
intire of itself." All of us
are parts of an integrated
economy. An injury to the
growth and health of that
economy will hit us all
alike. And the "little fel-
low" will suffer most of all.
