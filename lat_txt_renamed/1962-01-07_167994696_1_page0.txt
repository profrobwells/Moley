We Should Get States
Off the Federal Dole
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a singularly moving
book, "The Sovereign
States," James Jackson
Kilpatrick notes that in
the Virginia convention in
1788, which was debating
the ratification of the new
Constitution of the United
States, a bitter argument
took place between Patrick
Henry and Edmund Pen-
dleton.
Henry contended that
under the proposed Con-
stitution a grasping fed-
eral government would
seize the powers of the
states one by one. Pendle-
ton contended that "the
two governments were es-
tablished for different pur-
poses, and act on different
objects. They can no
more clash than two paral-
lel lines can meet."
Henry was right. Pen-
dleton's geometry didn't
work.

Those were battles long
ago and there were fire
and color in them. So, in-
deed, are the conflicts in
the South where a few
Negro children seek ad-
mission to an all-white
school.
But in these early days
in January, when the
newspapers are full of
news about state, city, and
federal budgets, we per-
ceive no color or drama—
only figures meaningless
to most and confusing
even to the expert.
Those figures, together
with the various messages
reporting financial affairs,
embody a threat to our
Constitutional system far
more serious than the bar-
ring of certain schools
against Negro children. In
good time those schools
will be open to all quali-
fied scholars.
But once the states are
utterly dependent upon
federal funds to serve
their people and the pry-
ing hands of federal bu-
reaucrats take over, the
separate identity of fed-
eral and state authority
will be a fiction.

There is progress to-
ward admitting qualified
Negro children to all
schools, but the rights of
the states in all other re-
spects are being rapidly
destroyed. Their progres-
sive decay is accomplished
by the twin forces of the
loss of their sources of
taxation to the federal oc-
topus and their acceptance
of larger and more grants-
in-aid.
When William H. Taft
was President, federal
grants to the states
amounted to only $3 mil-
lion. This rose to $33 mil-
lion in 1920. In 1941 it was
$836 million. In 1952 it was
$3,176 million.

In that year, candidate
Eisenhower took note of
this federal invasion of the
states in a speech or two.
After he was President he
created, through Congress,
an intergovernmental rela-
tions commission. The
commission made a report,
and Congress ignored it.
The grants continued to
grow and in the present
year will reach the tre-
mendous sum of $8 billion.
The former research di-
rector of the Eisenhower
intergovernmental com-
mission, George C. S. Ben-
son, and Prof. Harold F.
McClelland have just writ-
ten a report on the subject
which is published by the
American Enterprise Assn.
in Washington. They note
the peril to our institutions
in the growth of handouts
to the states and local com-
munities.

They also recognize that
the best of all solutions is
to return certain stolen tax
sources to the states and
thus let them care for
themselves.
But, pending that, they
suggest two reforms that
make a lot of sense. The
better of the two is to give
the states a general grant,
without strings, and let
them spend it as they
wish. Another plan would
be "consolidated grants,"
which would be for gen-
eral items such as health,
highways, etc., which the
states could manage them-
selves.
★
Two good results would
come from either plan.
The federal bureaucracy
would be got out of the
affairs of the states. Also,
the big pressure organiza-
tions which are encamped
in Washington would have
to spread into 50 state cap-
itols. Thus decentralized,
they would have less pow-
er.
The principle involved
is to keep the government
close to the people who are
taxed. Nobody can quarrel
with that idea—except,
of course, the majority of
this Congress and the
ever-grasping federal bu-
reaucracy.
