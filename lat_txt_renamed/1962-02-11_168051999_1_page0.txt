Expanding Bureaucracy Decreases
Rather Than Increases Efficiency
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Byrd's analysis of
the budget figures
shows that the proposed
increases for military pur-
poses, foreign aid, and
space exploration amount
in all to $2.8 billion. The
rise in the cost of the na-
tional debt will be $400
million.
But towering above the
foregoing increases, which
may well be necessary,
there are proposed in-
creases of $3.5 billion in
spending for 400 purely
civil agencies, programs,
and projects. We may add
to that increased outlays
of $1.1 billion from so-
called trust funds.
★
The cost of domestic
items in the federal gov-
ernment therefore will in-
crease $4.6 billion. This is
more than three times as
much as the increases in
military spending. It is
also $1.8 billion more than
increases for the military,
foreign aid, and space ex-
ploration combined.
There is also an item
for raising the pay of gov-
ernment officials, a very
large part of which goes to
the civilian bureaucracy.
This is $200 million.
Congress has permitted
this monstrous bureau-
cracy to grow with little
consideration of the plain
fact that as the size of a
centralized government es-
tablishment grows, it be-
comes progressively less
efficient, and thus more
costly in proportion to the
services it renders to the
people of the country.
In 1954 President Eisen-
hower brought this fact to
the attention of the Coun-
cil of State Governors and
later of Congress. Accord-
ingly, there was created a
commission on intergov-
ernmental relations con-
sisting of 25 members.

This commission con-
ducted some very useful
studies into the question of
redistributing some of the
federal activities to the
state and local govern-
ments. To a large extent,
the useful recommenda-
tions of the commission
have been ignored by Con-
gress.
George C. S. Benson,
president of Claremont
Men's College, was re-
search director of the com-
mission, and after his ex-
perience there he brought
about the organization of a
group of students of gov-
ernment and economics in
a new institute for studies
in federalism at his col-
lege. The purpose was to
examine the problem of
centralization versus de-
centralization in an atmos-
phere detached from pol-
itics and bureaucratic am-
bitions and jealousies.
A preliminary volume
has just been issued by
the institute, consisting of
essays by five members of
Benson's group.
One of these, by Prof.
Proctor Thompson, states
a number of most interest-
ing considerations bearing
upon losses and gains in
efficiency as a govern-
ment's administration in-
creases. There are, he ad-
mits, certain advantages
in large size. But these are
checked and overbalanced
as a bureaucracy grows.
A number of the reasons
for the decline in efficiency
I would summarize as fol-
lows:
1—As the size of a
government, or a depart-
ment or bureau thereof,
and the variety of its ac-
tivities multiply, the di-
recting head has less and
less time to give to each of
these activities and to pro-
vide decisions and direc-
tion.
2—When, as in Mr.
Eisenhower's time, the
concept of a chain of com-
mand is established (on
paper at least), the direc-
tive force from the top de-
clines as it passes through
the various subordinate
parts. There is, to use a
phrase in the electrical in-
dustry, a "line loss" in the
chain of command.
3—The number of peo-
ple in the bureaucracy
multiplies because of the
addition of supervisors and
liaison people among the
parts.
4—As Parkinson says,
the capacity of a bureau-
cracy to invent new activ-
ities is without limit, and
new activities require still
more bureaucrats.
5—Wasteful feuds mul-
tiply among various bu-
reaus and departments
dealing with the same
subject.
6—As the federal ac-
tivities grow, they are geo-
graphically scattered
among the states and local
areas of the nation. This
again weakens the capaci-
ty of Washington compe-
tently to supervise them.
★
Altogether, as Thomp-
son says, these defects in
administrative efficien-
cy appear in business es-
tablishments as well as
government. But, he con-
cludes, "the advantages of
large-scale operations are
far less considerable in
public rather than private
organizations and the dis-
advantages are common
to both."
