Are Republicans Watering Rose
Bushes While the House Burns?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Republicans have com-
pleted their series of Lin-
coln Day speeches, and
they can now go back to
their drawing boards. The
verbal explosions were of a
very low yield and the fall-
out was slight along the
Eastern Seaboard, where
Sen. Jacob K. Javits grum-
bled in New York City
with Gov. John A. Volpe,
of Massachusetts and Sen.
Margaret Chase Smith was
heard from in Bangor, Me.
They spoke of party
division rather than party
unity, of what Republicans
should do rather than the
basic questions of just how
to get into a position to
implement any program.
They raked their party,
leaving their party's oppo-
nent relatively unscathed.

Theirs was a weary re-
cital of precisely what
Democrats might have
ghosted for them.
The Republican "image"
needs improvement, said
Gov. Volpe, because it is
being pictured as a "nega-
tive party that is always
against things."
Javits claimed that the
party was "paying too
much attention to the
'thunder on the right' and
not enough to the 'thunder
in the cities."
From Maine, Sen. Smith
indulged in attacks on Re-
publicans who would not
declare their candidacy for
1964, on GOP faintheart-
edness and defeatism.
She even launched into a
consideration of 1968.
Javits, in particular, re-
sembled a man watering
his rose bushes while his
house burns. After all,
with a big Democratic
majority in Congress, with
committee chairmen all
Democrats, and a Demo-
cratic President constantly
sending messages to the
Hill and bringing enor-
mous political pressure to
bear for liberal measures,
the function of the Repub-
lican Party must, in our
two-party system, be that
of the opposition.

The Republican Party,
like the defensive platoon
on Sunday afternoon, does
not call plays for the of-
fense. It does not propose.
For it does not have the
ball. Chaining loyal oppo-
sition to negativism does
Javits' party a grave dis-
service.
Fundamental differ-
ences do exist between a
great majority of Repub-
licans and the majority of
Democrats in Congress.
This is revealed by a most
comprehensive study of
voting on 115 roll-calls in
the Senate and 40 in the
House of Representatives
by a highly reliable pri-
vate research agency.
The voting considered
involved domestic issues
only â€” government inter-
vention in the private
economy, spending and fis-
cal responsibility, bureau-
cratic growth and centrali-
zation of federal power,
and labor relations.

How did Javits meas-
ure up to the great ma-
jority of his party's mem-
bers in the Senate? On
domestic conservatism he
voted 80 times with the
overwhelming majority of
the Democrats. His record
is a 27% average of what
most members of his par-
ty supported.
Sen. Keating and Smith
rate 58 and 61% respec-
tively.
aid to education." Of
course, these matters in-
volve Javits' avid desire
for even greater federal
centralism.
*
It is difficult for Repub-
licans to take seriously the
ideological advice of a man
who has firmly identified
himself with the most
liberal wing of the
Democratic Party. Javits'
27% is approached by on-
ly one other Republican
senator, Clifford Case of
New Jersey, with 29%.
The trend in the new
members of the House of
Representatives shows
that in most cases they
have responsible conserv-
ative voting records.
Surely they would say
that they are representing
their constituents' best in-
terests and would hardly
agree with Javits that
what is good for New York
City is good for the rest of
the country.
*
In his Lincoln Day din-
ner remarks, Javits assert-
ed that President Kenne-
dy had "failed to redeem
his campaign pledges on
civil rights... to denounce
him or request action to
modernize our unjust and
discriminatory immigra-
tion laws... to obtain sup-
port within his own party
for a critically needed pro-
gram of medical care for
the aging."
*
He also attacked the
President for bungling
"the leadership on federal
There are many indica-
tions that people around
the country are becoming
more and more wary to-
ward federal centralism.
Many of these new Repub-
lican representatives have
learned that a frail bridge
of words resembling what
the liberal Democrats
have advocated is no sub-
stitute for a sound, rein-
forced structure of organ-
ization.
