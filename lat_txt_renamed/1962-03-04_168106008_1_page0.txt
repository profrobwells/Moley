The Balance of Payments Problem
May Shred Fabric of U.S. Economy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Kennedy is
slowly and painfully learn-
ing—and we may hope
not too late—the truth
of expressions used of-
ten by the predecessor he
most admires, Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
When running for Pres-
ident in 1932 and for a
short time thereafter, Mr.
Roosevelt had a habit of
using two expressions
closely related in mean-
ing. One was that the eco-
nomic system was a
"seamless web" which if
torn in one spot distorted
the whole. The other was
the need for a "concert
of interests"—which
meant the interdepend-
ence of all sectors of the
economy.

The problems faced by
a federal administration
and the proposals for solv-
ing them are not independ-
ent units, each to be nice-
ly wrapped up and placed
on display in a political
campaign. They are, in-
stead, like apples in a bar-
rel. The rot in one spreads
everywhere.
Let us consider, there-
fore, the interdependence
of such policies and prob-
lems as the size of the
spending total for a year,
the tangled mass of tax
laws, the revision of tar-
iffs, the wage-price spiral,
the constant threat of los-
ing gold, and the balance
of payments.
*
All of these chickens
seem to be coming home
to roost in 1962. And as
one wit is said to have
remarked, "And you, Mr.
President, are in the coop."
Essentially, he is the
coop's responsible keeper.
In a recent address, a
distinguished New York
business economist, Hans
A. Widenmann, showed
the relationship of the
foregoing problems one to
the other and to the health
of the nation's economy.
The basic problem and
the best means of indicat-
ing the impact of all oth-
er problems, Widenmann
points out, is the balance
of payments. It is difficult
for most Americans to un-
derstand this as do the
people of Britain and of
continental countries be-
cause, despite all our talk
about "global responsibil-
ities," we are novices in
international trade and the
interaction of internation-
al finance.
*
But as Widenmann puts
it, our "balance of pay-
ments deficit is a very sim-
ple thing. It means that
we are living beyond our
means."
It cannot be serious so
long as the other de-
veloped nations are will-
ing to lend us the differ-
ence. But they will stop
doing that unless we show
some evidence that we are
capable of putting our
house in order.
It is like the relation be-
tween a bank and a bor-
rower of money. So long
as the banker knows that
his client is a responsible
person and that he is not
letting his affairs get out
of hand, his credit will
be good. But when these
virtues cease to be appar-
ent, the net closes and the
client is in trouble.

We must understand
that Japan and the devel-
oped countries of Europe
have made enormous
progress not only in the
recovery of their respec-
tive economies but in
methods of co-operation.
We are no longer the rich
uncle to them that we
were in the first years
after the war. They are in
big business now and
moving fast.
The Common Market is
getting into high produc-
tion. Its industry is al-
ready mastering the art of
automation. With centu-
ries of trading experience
behind them, the busi-
nessmen of these coun-
tries are competing with
us on every side.
While we are giving ex-
travagant handouts to un-
developed countries, Eu-
ropeans and Japanese are
picking up whatever ad-
vantages are available in
trade in those countries.
They are also trading with
countries behind the Iron
Curtain. They are able to
overlook differences in
ideology so long as there
is profitable trade to be
had.
They are also high-
ly sophisticated financiers.
They view our inflation-
ary budget policies with
grave concern.
*
Meanwhile, under the
pressures of labor's politi-
cal power, there are signs
of more concessions in
wages and shorter hours.
This means more infla-
tionary momentum. Few
people are deluded enough
to believe the great expec-
tations of revenue in the
President's budget meas-
ure.
The foreign trade pro-
posals of the President are
wonderful things to occu-
py the orators in Congress.
But unless basically sound
conditions are restored in
our economy at home, un-
less mad spending is re-
strained, unless sound eco-
nomic truths are observed
rather than the fairy tales
told by labor and admin-
istration economists, the
cutting of our tariff pro-
tections will harm rather
than help.
*
Major, wholesale deci-
sions must be made in tax-
ation, trade policy, agricul-
ture, and labor. Unless
what Kipling called the
copy book maxims are re-
membered and applied
soon, we shall pay bitterly
for our neglect.
