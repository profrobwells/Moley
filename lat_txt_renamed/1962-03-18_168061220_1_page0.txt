Government Controls
Hidden in Health Plan
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In February, 1950, in
Bristol, Eng., I had a most
interesting evening with
the Socialist firebrand,
Aneurin Bevan. It was
during the national elec-
tion which all but shook
the Labor Party from pow-
er. Bevan was minister of
health, in charge of the
new National Health Serv-
ice.
Along with two other
American newspapermen,
I met Bevan at his hotel
before a political meeting
which he was to address
and arranged to see him
when he returned.
The meeting which we
attended was a very rowdy
affair. A tough dock work-
er was engaged in mutual
recrimination with the
sturdy speaker.
The heckler drew from
his mouth a plate of false
teeth and waved it at Bev-
an, who shouted, "I am the
minister of health and I
am going to take those
teeth away from you." The
man shouted back, "I paid
five pounds for these and
they are my own.
The argument ceased,
and Bevan put on display
as forceful a demonstra-
tion of crowd control and
incitement as any dema-
gogue I have ever heard.

After the meeting we
met and engaged in three
hours of discussion. The
best remembered
comment was Bevan's reply
to my question about how
he intended to get control
of the British medical pro-
fession: "We have the hos-
pitals, and that means we
will control the doctors.
They can't practice with-
out places to practice."
This comment came
back to me as I read the
President's message, deliv-
ered two weeks ago, ex-
plaining his plan for medi-
cal care for the aged—a
plan embodied in the
King-Anderson Bill.
The Kennedy-King-An-
derson plan is designed to
provide the argument by
its proponents that there
is no intention to control
or interfere with the free
practice of medicine. It is
aimed specifically at (a)
in-patient hospital serv-
ices, (b) nursing home
services, (c) services in the
home of the patient, and
(d) out-patient hospital
diagnostic service.
While there is the usual
language barring control
of hospitals or doctors,
there are elaborate provi-
sions for supervision and
for the making of specifi-
cations by the secretary of
health, education and wel-
fare. If these are not con-
trols, it is difficult to find
a word that will better suit
this procedure.
Because the doctor-hos-
pital relationship is indi-
visible, almost every doc-
tor will be controlled by a
government which con-
trols the hospital which
he uses for his patients.
He needs beds for pa-
tients. When those beds
are pre-empted by elderly
chronic cases, many of
whom do not need hospital
care, there will be fewer
for his emergencies. Hence,
there will be overcrowd-
ing, and then the federal
government will have to
spend more to provide ad-
ditional hospitals or addi-
tions to existing ones.
In dealing with the re-
cipients of the Kennedy-
King—Anderson plan,
countless doctors will have
the strong inducement
that now confronts them
with workmen's compen-
sation cases. That is to
"over-treat and over-hos-
pitalize" patients.
Consider this in connec-
tion with the millions of
new people under the pro-
posed plan. Both doctors
and hospitals will have
larger incomes in the first
years of this plan. But
they will be paying the
bitter price of losing their
independence.
★
Doctors will tell you that
much of the hospitaliza-
tion of the elderly is not
because of definable ill-
ness. It is simply the de-
teriorization which accom-
panies old age.
Also, there is the tend-
ency of those who are idle
after a life of active work
to fall the victim of worry
about bodily ailments.
The Kennedy-King-An-
derson plan starts us on a
long and probably endless
road, a road which we
should avoid now and here.
