Court Ruling on Representation
Out of Step With Constitution?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Back at the turn of the
century, this observation
was made by Finley Peter
Dunne:
""What's that?" asked
Mr. Hennessy.
""That is,' said Mr.
Dooley, 'no matter wheth-
er th' Constitution follows
th' flag or not, th' Supreme
Court follows th' iliction
returns.'"
It is a pity that Dunne
could not be here now to
provide the common sense
necessary to understand
the meaning of what the
1962 Supreme Court has
said in its decision open-
ing the federal courts to
those who seek what they
call a more "democratic"
representation in state
legislatures.
For the court not only
is following the election
returns. It has taken a
step which will permit.it
to determine what those
returns will be. In Justice
Frankfurter's dissent
there is clearly outlined
what the consequences
may be under this stretch-
ing of the "equal protec-
tion of the laws" clause
in the Constitution.
equal representation in
the Senate - two mem-
bers from each, regardless
of population - while the
House of Representatives
was to have representa-
tion on the basis of pop-
ulation.
The Senate was created
in that pattern because
then - and I believe,
quite properly now - the
states were invested with
a certain sovereignty. It
was recognized then and it
is clear now that each
state, however small in
population, has specific in-
terests which deserve a
voice in the federal leg-
islature.
To recast the Senate
would overwhelm a score
of small states. They
would be subjected to the
vast popular majorities of
the heavily populated in-
dustrial states.
It will be answered that
to upset the present make-
up of the Senate, a Con-
stitutional amendment
would be needed. To ac-
complish that, Congress
would initiate the amend-
ment and send it to the
states for ratification.
Small states would ob-
ject. But suppose that the
necessary three-quarters
of the states would stand
to gain Senate represen-
tation under such an
amendment. They could
in consequence over-
whelm the one-quarter of
the small states which
would stand to be swal-
lowed up in the result.
But there is a factor
which will probably for-
ever bar such an amend-
ment from being proposed
by Congress, especially by
a Congress which is as
heavily dominated by
those who favor more fed-
eral power as the present
one.
With the proliferation
of the vast federal bu-
reaucracy, the administra-
tion in Washington now
has a horde of federal
bureaucrats in many of
the smaller states. The
vote of those bureaucrats
can and in some cases does
dominate elections. Hence,
the senators from those
states generally vote for
more and more federal
power and more handouts
for their sparsely populat-
ed areas.
This decision of the Su-
preme Court is in line
with what liberals call
"democracy at work." It
certainly is working with
a vengeance foreign to
our Constitutional tradi-
tions.
He points out, in an
opinion which should rank
with the great defenses of
Constitutional liberty,
that the majority opinion
is purely political:
"The court's author-
ity ultimately rests on
sustained public confi-
dence in its moral sanc-
tion. Such feeling must be
nourished by the court's
complete detachment, in
fact and in appearance,
from political entangle-
ments.
Frankfurter's opinion
also points out the dis-
tressing practical ques-
tions of fact, not law, of
such intervention in reap-
portioning the state legis-
latures. To review and
pass judgment upon the
"democratic" problems of
reapportionment would
lead the courts into "a
mathematical quagmire."
Whatever grounds there
may be for further open-
ing the breach in the Con-
stitution in the name of
"equal protection," the
spirit of the Constitution
itself is violated in this
decision. For the epochal
compromise which was
necessary, if there was to
be any Constitution at all,
set a pattern of represen-
tation which violated the
meaning with which liber-
als now have invested the
term "Democracy."
