Steel Crackdown May
Hold Threat to Unions
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For 27 years there has
been a mutually benefi-
cial alliance between the
major labor unions and
the dominant liberal ma-
jority of the Democratic
Party. This originated in
1935, when the Wagner
Act was passed, the CIO
was born, and certain un-
ions departed from the
policies of Samuel Gom-
pers and entered actively
into the political arena.
It might be well at this
moment for the thoughtful
members and leaders of
those unions to consider
the portent to them of the
recent demonstration of
naked political and offi-
cial power which beat the
big steel companies into
submission.

For a political regime
has interests in itself. It
is an entity in and for
itself, dedicated to the
maintenance and enlarge-
ment of its own power. It
welcomes allies and meas-
urably pays for their aid
at the polls by favorable
consideration of their
wishes.
But when there is an
issue in which the politi-
cal regime's interests run
counter to those of the
ally, self-preservation
comes first. Never has this
truth been so well dem-
onstrated as in the regime
now sitting in Washing-
ton.
Such a regime is con-
cerned primarily with the
consolidation of its power.
It has shown in the steel
battle that its weapons
are overwhelmingly pow-
erful.
The economic dogmas of
this regime are securely
based upon the Galbraith
thesis of immense spend-
ing in the "public sector,"
with inevitable deficits
and the resultant infla-
tion to be checked by
controls. The steel victory
of the President was in
effect control of prices—
albeit by means of coer-
cion through methods oth-
er than a straight author-
ization in the statutes.
And when prices are
controlled, wages must
also be controlled.
Thus, the guileless ally
may find itself the pris-
oner of its more powerful
partner.
A few weeks ago, I men-
tioned in one of these es-
says a long conversation
which I had with Aneurin
Bevan during the British
general election campaign
in 1950. His speech which
preceded the conversation
dealt with the steel indus-
try which the Labor Party
had started to nationalize
at that time.
I asked him what he
would do as a minister of
the Crown if, after nation-
alization, the leaders of
the trade unions tried to
exact wage increases and
benefits which the govern-
ment was against. "I
would put them in prison,"
he answered...
"But what if the work-
ers went on strike on their
own account?" I asked.
"I would put them in
the army," he replied.
That is the ultimate in
any form of government
control. Government must
be supreme. It must pre-
serve itself. There can be
no allies, no friends, no
powers except those who
agree.
The weapons used in
bringing steel manage-
ment to terms were for-
midable: investigations by
the Department of Jus-
tice, by the Federal Trade
Commission, by a grand
jury, by liberally con-
trolled congressional com-
mittees; discrimination in
defense contracts; even a
misuse of the FBI. And
the threat of the use of
the taxing power.

Against the unions, an-
other kind of attack might
be used: by the adminis-
tration of unemployment
compensation, which is
powerfully influenced by
federal authority. By the
NLRB. By control over
tariffs, and thus the pow-
er to bring in foreign com-
petition. And, as in the
case of management, by
harassing investigations.
