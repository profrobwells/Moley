Saga of the Texan Who Defended
Supreme Court Against F.D.R. Plan
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Stanley Walker's highly
controversial article in
the Saturday Evening
Evening Post bore the
title, "What Has Texas
Got to Brag About?"
One of the many
answers to that question
is the fact that Texas
elected and re-elected Hat-
ton Sumners of Dallas to
Congress over a period of
34 years. He died two
weeks ago at the age of
87, no doubt unrecon-
structed and unreformed.
In appraising Texas
statesmen, Walker was
not kind. But he failed to
mention Sumners, who
was profoundly respected
in the House of Repre-
sentatives for his learn-
ing in the law and custom
of the Constitution and for
his utter devotion to the
best in the American tra-
dition. He spoke seldom,
but when he did he com-
manded that sort of atten-
tion which is not often
seen in a legislative body.
One such occasion was
1937, after the battle over
the Roosevelt Supreme
Court packing plan had
been raging for many
weeks. Sumners was
chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, to
which President Roose-
velt's bill had been
referred.
As the undisputed mas-
ter of that committee, he
had permitted the bill to
rest in the files while the
Senate held hearings and
debated the subject. This
reason for inaction was
that he felt that as soon
as the country fully com-
prehended the magnitude
of the Roosevelt proposal,
there would be over-
whelming protest.
On the day when the
President sent the pro-
posal to Congress, he
called a meeting of con-
gressional leaders to the
White House to explain
things. Sumners, who
was present, sat in grim
silence.
Then he returned to the
Capitol in a taxi with Vice
President Garner and Sen-
ate majority leader Robin-
son. When he left them,
he turned and said, "Boys,
this is where I turn in my
chips."
"True, the Roosevelt
plan is not prohibited by
the words of the Constitu-
tion. But it certainly is for-
bidden by the principles
behind the Constitution.
From Bracton to Coke to
now, the independence of
the judiciary from the
executive has been fixed
custom. If that is lost, our
liberties are all lost.
"Now it comes down to
a decision of what kind of
government we want. If
we want a dictatorship, it
is one sort of court that
is required. But if we want
what our tradition calls
for, another sort of court
is necessary."
Sumners, in discussing
such questions, always
made free use of the con-
cept of natural law as the
dictate of the Lord. He
continued: "The fish in the
water in the mammoth
cave have no eyes. The
Lord felt that they need-
ed no eyes. That is the
way it is in nature. In
providing for human lib-
erty it is decreed that
there should be an inde-
pendent judiciary. I shall
stand with the law of na-
ture in this."
And he did, until Mr.
Roosevelt lost his first and
greatest conflict with
Congress. That victory
over Presidential caprice
can be attributed as much
to Sumners as to any oth-
er member of Congress.
There was nothing ar-
rogant or showy in this as-
sertion of constitutional
principle by Sumners. He
was a quiet man. He lived
alone with his books and
his legislative duties. His
only recreation was bird
watching.
With the death of Hat-
ton Sumners, something
of a resplendent past is
gone. But a new genera-
tion will ignore the les-
sons of his life at its great
peril.
For Sumners in his quiet
way deserves rank with
the figures of the great
past who stood for the
long-term interests of free
institutions against the
pressure of expediency
and short-term political
advantage.
