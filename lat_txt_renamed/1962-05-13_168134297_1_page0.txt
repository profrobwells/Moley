Does Kennedy Plan to Hold Power
by Gaining the Votes of Illiterates?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is deplorable that so
many politicians when
seeking some advantage
ignore the principles of po-
litical science. Instead,
they lower their discourse
to the level of the least in-
telligent of the people
whom they seek to influ-
ence.
President Kennedy is an
educated man. Somewhere,
in the courses he took at
Harvard and in the books
he read while there, he
must have learned the ele-
mentary fact that the exer-
cise of voting is neither a
right indiscriminately
granted nor a general priv-
ilege. It is, according to the
principles of political sci-
ence, an office.
In a free society, the of-
fice of voter is subject to
certain qualifications, just
as is the Presidency and a
seat in Congress. There
are all sorts of qualifica-
tions imposed for innumer-
able jobs in government.
For certain jobs the incum-
bent must be a lawyer, a
doctor, an engineer, or an
accountant.

Mr. Kennedy himself
has mentioned many
times, in pleading for pub-
lic school aid, the need for
certified teachers.
And so under our con-
stitutional system there
are established qualifica-
tions for the office of vot-
er. The states are given
the responsibility of de-
termining those qualifica-
tions. And, according to
the respective judgments
of the lawmakers of the
states, certain limitations
are placed upon the exer-
cise of voting.
For example, it is pre-
scribed that a certain term
of residence shall be ob-
served. This is to make
sure that the individuals
who vote really live in the
area for which they choose
the officers of government
and also know enough
about that area to select
wisely the people who
shall conduct its govern-
ment.
Since it is obvious that
voters must depend upon
the spoken and written
word for the knowledge es-
sential to make wise
choices of public officials,
there is generally a re-
quirement that they be lit-
erate in the English lan-
guage. Literacy tests are
not limited to the South.
New York and other states
go beyond mere certifica-
tion as to school attend-
ance and require tests in
English.
In those states there has
been little or no complaint
about the fairness with
which such tests are ap-
plied. There has been
much complaint about the
fairness with which such
tests have been applied in
other localities.
But the proposed rem-
edy for such abuses is the
usual shotgun approach.
It was pledged in the
Democratic platform that
all literacy tests in all
states should be swept
away and that instead
there be applied mere ev-
idence that the applicant
for a ballot has passed six
grades in school.
★
This is not only a grave
invasion of a right Consti-
tutionally granted to the
states but a blow to the
efforts of states like New
York to make sure that
those who exercise the of-
fice of voting know Eng-
lish as well as the lan-
guage of the countries
from which they came.
Ample opportunity to
learn English is provided
for old and young alike in
our schools. This require-
ment is not onerous, con-
sidering the immense re-
sponsibility which rests
upon the electorate. If
people want to make a
new home and take ad-
vantage of better economic
and cultural opportunities,
the least they can do is
to learn the language of
that new environment.
There are adequate laws
now to check the abuses
in imposing literacy tests.
But the attorney general
is impatient with the proc-
ess of law, and in true
Kennedy style would
sweep away the lawful
means of righting wrongs
through the courts and
would give the office of
voting to everyone.
★
It should be added in
conclusion that those who
wrote the Democratic plat-
form of 1960 and those
who advocate the legisla-
tion now before Congress
were making a very dam-
aging confession. They
are substantially admit-
ting that they cannot hope
to remain in office except
through the introduction
into the electorate of
countless numbers of il-
literates.
This means that the less
the people who hold the
power to remove them
know about what they are
doing, the better will be
their chance to keep their
jobs.
