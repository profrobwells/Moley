Estes Case Provides
GOP With Vital Issue
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are certain obser-
vations of a somewhat
philosophical nature which
need attention as the foul
smell of the Estes case
spreads over the land. The
most important, of course,
is that people in public
office should be honest,
alert, and responsive to
the public interest.
The real lesson is based
upon the hard reality that
the human species is not
perfect.
That was why the wise
men who wrote the Consti-
tution created a govern-
ment in which sovereign
power was divided at the
top into three parts, and
why a large measure of
independence was left to
the states. And that was
also why speech and the
press were guaranteed
their freedom.
In a monolithic govern-
ment, which liberalism is
trying so hard to create,
the activities of Estes,
however corrupt, would
have been quietly tucked
into a closet and the ras-
cals who collaborated with
him warned and later
dropped from sight.
Politicians are never
willing to commit hara
kiri in the market place.
The power of rationaliza-
tion, enforcing the instinct
of self-preservation, will
convince them that what
they do is right and pa-
triotic and in the public
interest.
Â¥
Recognizing the innate
rascality of men in pow-
er, the Founding Fathers
created a mechanism to
use self-interest to serve
the cause of virtue. And
after the Constitution had
been adopted, there arose
another great protection
for the public interest:
the two-party system-the
one party to hold office,
and the other to watch and
wait until it could gain of-
fice for itself.
In the Estes case the at-
torney general of Texas,
of a different faction with-
in the Democratic Party,
hurled the power of his of-
fice at Estes. Minority
party members in Con-
gress were ready for the
assault, and the vast bu-
reaucracy of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture decid-
ed to do some investigat-
ing itself.
A shocked and embar-
rassed federal administra-
tion moved slowly to clear
itself of a rapidly develop-
ing mess. However, its
reluctance to admit in-
competence has been
shown by the claims of
Secretary Freeman about
"ballooning" a minor inci-
dent.
Gen. Eisenhower came
close to the point of this
essay when he said, in re-
ferring to the Estes case,
that "every single investi-
gating body in the govern-
ment is now under control
of one party."
Specifically, he meant
that every committee
chairman in Congress,
along with every law en-
forcement agency in the
administration, including
the intensely partisan De-
partment of Justice, is
Democratic.
Fortunately, the Texas
attorney general and Sen.
McClellan in Congress are
not of the dominant ma-
jority of the Democratic
Party to which they nomi-
nally belong. Perhaps it
might be concluded that
until the Republican Par-
ty gains sufficient power
in the states and in Con-
gress to serve as a real
watch over federal affairs,
we shall have to rely up-
on the minority of South-
ern Democrats to keep
things measurably in
hand.

The Estes case has pro-
vided for Republicans in
the election this year-not
only in the contests for
House and Senate seats,
but in the state campaigns
-an issue of real impor-
tance. This is not to say
that honesty is found only
among Republicans. They,
too, are afflicted by plenty
of original sin.
But at any rate their in-
terests lie in keeping
watch over the party with
the reins of power.
Those who are seeking
office this year as Repub-
licans might well bring
this matter of government
principle and official pru-
dence to the attention of
an all too apathetic elec-
torate.
