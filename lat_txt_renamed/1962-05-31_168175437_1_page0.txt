Nixon: 1954 Prophet Hit Unfairly
I find it difficult to be-
lieve that California is the
same state I visited when
Richard Nixon was run-
ning for the U.S. Senate
in 1950. For at that time
he was under bitter fire
from liberals, on the
ground that he was an
extreme anti-Communist.
Now, in 1962, the ex-
treme anti-Communists are
bitterly attacking him be-
cause of his alleged lack of
sympathy for their cause.
At the same time the lib-
erals still harbor their
1950 antipathies.
What has happened to
cause this amazing
change? Is there any evi-
dence to show that in the
intervening years Nixon
has been soft toward the
Communist threat?

In 1953 the Vice Presi-
dent traveled extensively
in East Asia. On his re-
turn he submitted a mem-
orandum pointing out the
Communist threat to
Southeast Asia and Japan.
He quoted with approval
a leader in what was then
Indo-China, who said:
"If we divide it we will
lose; if we invite the
enemy into a conference
we will lose."
We did divide it, and
now we have all but lost
the pieces. We have been
conferring fruitlessly for
eight years and now beat
a retreat from Laos under
the guise of a coalition.
In April, 1954, Nixon
said at a meeting of news-
paper publishers that if it
proved necessary "to put
American boys in" to pre-
vent Communist expan-
sion in Indo-China, he per-
sonally favored such a
risk. This brought down
upon him a blast of criti-
cism.

But at long last the
boys are there.
But this 1954 statement
was all he could do as a
loyal member of the ad-
ministration in power. The
hundreds of millions of
wasted money and the in-
exorable creeping of Com-
munist power represent
the failure of eight years
of efforts by that ad-
ministration and the one
which followed.
In 1954, Nixon carried
the burden of the Repub-
Nixon
lican campaign and was
singled out for attack by
the liberals who remem-
bered 1950. And Repub-
lican liberals tried to keep
him off the national ticket
in 1956.
In 1958, he traveled in
Latin America. The Com-
munists there marked him
as their deadly enemy and
planned violence and hos-
tile demonstrations well
before he came.
His forceful talk to
Khrushchev in Moscow
needs no elaboration.
In 1959, Castro visited
the United States, still
shamming as an agrarian
reformer. Nixon had a long
conference with him which
he described in a confi-
dential memorandum for
the administration. He
said that Castro was a dic-
tator in the Communist
pattern who was either ut-
terly naive or "subject to
Communist discipline."
The State Department,
which had permitted —
even assisted — the rise of
Castro, was apparently not
impressed.

Thus, Nixon fought in
the Eisenhower adminis-
tration to show the reality
and danger of communism.
But in the course of
those years Robert Welch
created his Birch Society
and vilified Eisenhower
and Nixon. He saw ap-
peasement in every chim-
ney corner. Since Nixon
regarded such vituperation
as positively harmful to
the anti-Communist cause,
he denounced it.
This brought about the
attacks to which he is sub-
jected now.
He has opposed an anti-
Communist Constitutional
amendment not because he
lacks sympathy for its pur-
pose, but because it is bad-
ly drawn and would not
prove effective. Also, he
has refused to attack a fel-
low Republican in the pri-
mary.
For these three positions
he may lose votes. But to
take them required real
courage.
★
But if Nixon should re-
count this record, he would
invite attack from Gov.
Brown and the liberals
who are saying that only
state issues are involved
in this contest for the gov-
ernorship and, by implica-
tion, that the immense
state of California has no
interest in what happens
in Southeast Asia and
Cuba.
An utterly fantastic de-
tail of this campaign is the
appearance of Earl War-
ren's son among Nixon's
enemies, although in so
doing he is really helping
the extremists who are
calling for the impeach-
ment of his father.
This is often the lot of
a moderate who seeks ra-
tional and legal ends. He
becomes the center of at-
tack from both extremes.
In a political campaign,
as in war, the voice of rea-
son is stilled. The extrem-
ists command the rostrum
and get the headlines.
