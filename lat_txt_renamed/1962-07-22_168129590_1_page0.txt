Federal Power Monopoly Might
Open Door to Industrial Socialism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is quite generally anticipated that by 1975 a
considerable part of the
nation's supply of electricity will be generated
by nuclear fission.
For this reason, and
also because of the federal
government's huge investment in nuclear reactors,
zealous advocates of a federal monopoly in electric
power have been pressing
for some years to accomplish their end by building
new reactors or converting old ones. A few years
ago, a proposal was made
to build several reactors
for electrical production.
This was rejected by Congress.
*
Then last year the Senate approved an administration plan to spend $95
million to add electric
generating facilities to a
new reactor at Hanford,
Wash. This proposed
plant would produce, it
was said, 860,000 kilowatts, half the capacity of
the Grand Coulee plant.
Opposition to this project immediately came
from members of the
House and also from the
coal industry, the Mineworkers Union and investor-owned electric companies. The project was
deleted by a House vote.
Later, an attempt to get
the Senate version adopted
in conference was frustrated by strong opposition.
Subsequently a plan
was devised to bypass
Congress entirely. A
group of public-power
agencies in the State of
Washington, organized as
the Washington Public
Power Supply System,
proposed to build the electrical production facilities
itself and to finance it by
revenue bonds. Accordingly, an agreement was tentatively made with the
Bonneville power administration to have that federal agency take the power
produced by the project
and market it through
its Northwest grid.
★
That this interposition
of the WPPSS was only
a neat trick to assure the
ultimate federal ownership of the electric power
facilities is shown by one
feature of the proposed
contract. This provides
that the Bonneville
agency could take over the
WPPSS properties later if
it chose by paying off the
outstanding obligations of
the WPPSS.
The congressional opposition to the 1961 scheme,
notably Congressman
James E. Van Zandt, who
is a member of the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy, vigorously voiced
opposition. Finally, since
agreement for the new
plan would have to be obtained from the Atomic
Energy Commission, that
body requested a ruling
from the comptroller general. This ruling, under
date of July 6, concluded
that the legislative history
of the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954 shows an intent
by Congress that no
electric energy generating
facility should be built
without congressional approval now; that the
WPPSS project should follow congressional authorization and appropriation,
and that since Congress
had refused to authorize
the AEC to construct
such facilities in 1961, it
could not agree to the plan
without congressional approval now.
This would seem to have
ended this slick attempt by
public power people to
circumvent Congress.
However, now there
comes Sen. Henry Jackson,
who would provide that in
the marketing of such
power the investor-owned
(private) companies should
get 50% of the power
generated. This is quite
obviously an effort to remove the objections of
those companies by cutting them in for some of
the production. It is not
likely to succeed.
★
But it is not the specific
interests of these companies that is the main consideration. The real issue
is whether this immensely important source of
electric power should be
operated by a federal monopoly or by free enterprise. For it should be
clear to anyone that if the
production and distribution of electric power are
in the hands of the central
government, this country
is well on the way to socialism in all industrial
life. Free enterprise would
be virtually at its end.
