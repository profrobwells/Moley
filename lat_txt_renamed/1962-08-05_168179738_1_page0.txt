Republicans May Ambush Kennedy
on the Campaign Trail This Fall
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Kennedy says
he is going to take to the
stump this autumn. That
is good news, even for Re-
publicans. For it will
center the issue directly
upon him and his policies.
Since most people find
issues, confusing, such a
campaign centers upon a
personality. There will be
side shows in every state,
and congressional district.
But the President will be
in the big tent.
The opposition looks
forward to the hunt for
votes with mounting con-
fidence. Its issues are fair-
ly well made for it. The
main worry must fall upon
Mr. Kennedy, his master
operator, the attorney gen-
eral, and the assorted plan-
ners who help map strate-
gy and prepare speeches.
They must find reasons
why there should be more
Democrats in Congress.
The stated demands of the
President are modest: five
or 10 members of the
House, and a few senators.
Republicans are aiming at
anything up to the num-
ber necessary to control
the House, and a handful
of new senators.

It may be that the Ken-
nedy strategists will de-
cide to use the rusty weap-
ons of 1960 once more.
These would be appeals to
ever-wanting minorities—
promises of more subsi-
dies, benefits and advan-
tages. This would involve
an "iffy" campaign, since
most of the 1960 promises
have not been realized.
The President must say
that these blessings would
have been bestowed if Con-
gress had not thwarted
him. That is not a con-
vincing case, even with the
people who voted for him
in 1960. For in that year
they also gave him a nice
fat majority in both houses
of Congress.
In response to that re-
ply, he must say, "But you
didn't give me the right
kind of Democrats. Take
some of these shoddy
specimens back and give
me some nice fresh Ken-
nedy men."
His task will be geo-
graphically extensive as
well as ideologically in-
tensive, because he must
give a helping hand to
the very large number of
Democrats who have loy-
ally voted for his pro-
grams. They will need
help, except in a few dis-
tricts, because there will
be hungry Republican
candidates worrying them.
And he must find a few
Republican districts where
the margin is small
enough to offer some
chance for a change.
There are not many of
those. Perhaps that is why
his objective of five or 10
House seats is so modest.
In the general Kennedy
appeals to the country at
large, his speeches can-
not be sophisticated dis-
courses like the Yale
speech. For that sort of
thing goes far over the
heads of most Americans.
★
And most of those who
did understand the novel,
unorthodox "dialogue" of
the Yale speech do not be-
lieve his theories are
sound. Orthodoxy is pret-
ty well embedded in the
American investor and
customer. He still believes
that two and two make
four, that you cannot pile
deficits upon deficits with-
out dangerous inflation,
that matching spending
with income is an Ameri-
can habit and a good one,
and that if a policy of
planned inflation has not
worked in the past to pro-
duce greater national
wealth, it will not work in
the future.
But along with those
Americans who are still
firmly orthodox will be an-
other listening and read-
ing public which has no
votes but which can ex-
ercise a profound influ-
ence on the American
economy. These are the
West Europeans who are
in the governments there
and in the central and pri-
vate banks and the Euro-
pean private investors.
They are watching the
American nest in which
they have placed so many
of their investment eggs.
They are watching the
guardians of that nest who
are in charge of the ad-
ministration in Washing-
ton.
And beyond those West-
ern Europeans are smart
fellows in the Kremlin
who have an orthodoxy all
their own. This holds that
capitalist countries will
destroy themselves be-
cause of their own
excesses. They, too, will be
watching affairs here.
