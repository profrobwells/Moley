President May Be Reaching for
Too Much Power in the Trade Act
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Everyone wants more
foreign trade, just as ev-
eryone wants good medical
care for all and better
schools. But with the Ken-
nedy "trade expansion act
of 1962," as with the
school construction bill of
1961 and the medicare bill
of 1962, great apprehen-
sion has been expressed
concerning the means to
achieve the end.
In the House, the Ways
and Means Committee con-
sidered the bill carefully
and the House passed it
with little change... Now
the Senate Finance Com-
mittee has concluded its
hearings and the bill is
facing debate, first in the
committee and then on the
Senate floor.
In a Congress anxious to
get down to the business
of campaigning for re-
election it becomes more
than likely that there will
merely be a renewal of the
old reciprocal trade agree-
ments act for another year,
with a new start ahead in
1963 for modifications.
For this fate much of
the responsibility will rest
upon the President and
those members of his ad-
ministration who prepared
this complicated and po-
tentially dangerous plan.

Since everybody wants
more trade with foreign
countries but nobody
wants to be hurt, the ef-
forts to provide safeguards
in this bill were an effort
to please everyone con-
cerned. But even the pros-
pective beneficiaries do
not seem convinced that
their interests are really
protected.
Moreover, since most of
the arrangements provid-
ed for are subject to the
almost unlimited discre-
tion of the President, the
bill is resisted because the
President himself and
members of his adminis-
tration have reached for so
much power that a genu-
ine fear prevails lest such
powers will be used with-
out the wise judgment that
large powers require.
The extent of the pro-
posed new Presidential
power is in several sec-
tions of the bill.
As the bill originated, it
would permit the Presi-
dent to negotiate agree-
ments not only on single
items but on whole classes
of commodities — agree-
ments which would reduce
our tariff duties by as
much as 50%. In dealings
with the Common Market,
there would be power to
cut by more than 50% in
cases in which the United
States and the Common
Market produce 80% of
the goods in world trade.
The provision by which
injured industries would
receive a federal handout
means just another sub-
sidy. Here the old argu-
ment of the free traders,
that tariffs protect the in-
efficient, can be made
against this provision in
the plan. For who is to tell
whether these new subsi-
dies would be protecting
the efficient or the ineffi-
cient? Such a determina-
tion would be almost im-
possible to make.
The further provision
that workers displaced by
foreign competition will
be given payment would
hopelessly complicate the
already complicated sys-
tem of unemployment
compensation. There
would be discrimination
among the unemployed.
And state systems would
be seriously undermined.
Organized labor is very
considerably disturbed
about this provision.
Unlike the present and
earlier trade agreements
legislation, this plan would
make it exceedingly diffi-
cult for Congress to veto
the decisions of the Presi-
dent.
There is also a political
consideration which
weighs heavily on mem-
bers of Congress. Under
this administration there
has been a great deal of
pressure from the White
House in the form of
threats to withdraw de-
fense and other benefits
from a district if a mem-
ber fails to conform to its
demands.
The authority to impov-
erish a community or dis-
trict by cutting tariffs on
its products would be an
additional club to hang
over a recalcitrant mem-
ber. Perhaps if some of the
powers of the President
had been more sparingly
used, this fear would not
be so great. But that such
pressures have been so
ruthlessly used is a hard
fact.
