Did Kennedy Postpone Tax Cut
to Ward Off a Political Disaster?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When a President like
Mr. Kennedy, whose in-
grained political motiva-
tions are so well estab-
lished, makes a major de-
cision in domestic affairs,
we must assume that his
reason is predominantly
political.
In deciding against ask-
ing for a tax cut now, he
was seeking to avoid an-
other disaster in Congress,
which would probably end
in a disaster at the polls
in November. He knows
well that to ask for the
cut now would end in such
a conflict in Congress that
there would be no decision
there at all.
Also, if he revealed what
kind of tax cut he wants,
his party would be sharply
divided.
For what the AFL-CIO
and his academic advisers
want is a world apart from
what the business commu-
nity and the conservatives
in Congress are thinking
about.
Beyond the political as-
pects of the subject, how-
ever is an unbridgeable
chasm in economic philos-
ophy. There are those who
believe in forcing econom-
ic growth through tax cuts
of a calculated inflationary
character. Others believe
in permitting economic
growth through invest-
ment.
The one would put dol-
lars into the hands of con-
sumers generally. The oth-
er would relax the tax bur-
den on those who would,
through investment, pro-
vide more jobs and more
risk capital to develop new
forms of production.
Mr. Kennedy paid cer-
tain verbal respects to the
business community in
this sentence:
"The administration in-
tends to cut taxes in order
to build the fundamental
strength of our economy;
to remove a serious barrier
to long term growth; to
increase incentive by root-
ing out inequities and com-
plexities; and to prevent
the even greater deficit
that a lagging economy
would otherwise surely
produce."
But in mentioning defi-
cits, there was no word
about the shortest route to
deficit cutting, which is to
reduce federal spending.
We may assume that the
President is still firmly
convinced, as are his aca-
demic advisers, that lavish
spending programs are not
a deterrent but a means for
economic growth. To aban-
don that belief would be
to reverse his direction
entirely and cause a sharp
break with his most pow-
erful allies-labor leaders
and others.
Those allies argue some-
what inconsistently that
that we recovered in the
1930s because of federal
spending and also that, if
we did not recover then,
it was because the govern-
ment did not spend
enough. The fact is-and
this can be proved by the
statistics of those years-
that recovery began in
1933 and continued while
prudent spending was the
rule, and that growth
slowed down almost to a
standstill after spending
increased after 1936.
If we failed to run a
larger deficit in 1939-the
last pre-defense-spending
year it was because the
President and Congress
prevented it. But even
then the deficit was larger
than it was in the depths
of the depression.
The other point of view
is that the only lasting
means of growth is to
lighten the tax burden on
those individuals and busi-
nesses which will use
what they save in capital
investment. Also, that
such investments are en-
couraged when prudent
spending policies offer an
assurance that we will not
be caught in a tide of in-
flation.

The prospect of infla-
tion, which would be inev-
itable with a deficit of such
proportions as a tax cut
would produce perhaps
as much as $15 billion-
would confront the man-
agement of industry with
the dire prospect that any
enlargement of plant or
new product development
might entail prohibitive
costs.
Such a deficit would also
frighten foreign investors
here and spark a major
withdrawal of our already
depleted supply of gold.
With a loss of faith in
the dollar here. there
might well be that hyster-
ical flight from money into
goods which is the really
deadly phase of inflation.
In such a panic, all sense
of values is forgotten and
the economy rushes into
the final disaster. Savings
would be ransacked and
wiped out. Long-term fed-
eral bonds would go beg-
ging in a disbelieving
market, the printing press-
es would whirr, and the
final end would be vast
unemployment and dis-
tress.
â˜…
These are lessons that
can be read in the history
of countries on the con-
tinent of Europe. And
those countries which
have felt the impact of
such disasters will read
the signs here in the Unit-
ed States better than we
can or than Mr. Kennedy's
advisers can admit.
What are now being de-
manded by conservatives
of both parties in Congress
are specifications on tax
reform from the adminis-
tration. If the proposal is
merely to cut deductions,
individual and corporate,
few intelligent people are
interested. For such par-
ing away of those items
will produce little revenue.
Nor are the suggestions,
leaked out from the ad-
ministration, for ending
tax benefits in profit shar-
ing. capital gains, pension
plans and the like enough
to meet the losses oc-
casioned by an across the
board tax cut. And we may
be well assured that no
serious effort will be sug-
gested to close certain
grapping loopholes such as
co-operative exemptions,
savings and loan advan-
tages, and the like.
Real reform in taxation
might well end in a hope-
less congressional dead-
lock. At present, the prom-
ise of relief without a
promise of government
economy is merely an ex-
ercise in make-believe.
