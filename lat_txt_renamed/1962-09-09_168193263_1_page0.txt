Reaction Rides the New Frontier
It becomes more and
more apparent that Pres-
ident Kennedy, despite the
projection of the image of
a man who loves to read
books, has never obtained
a systematic grasp of basic
economic and political his-
tory. For his legislative
proposals and his spoken
economic "dialogue" show
that he is inviting us to
return to an economic or-
der which goes back two
centuries or more to a pe-
riod before the American
Revolution.
The President and his
advisers would accomplish
this by promoting a mish-
mash of economic pana-
ceas made politically at-
tractive by an alleged
meeting of "needs."
Taken collectively, this
aggregate of policies and
legislative enactments
would concentrate eco-
nomic affairs in an all-
powerful central govern-
ment. That is exactly what
Americans were resisting
in the revolution and what
they sought to prevent in
the American Constitution.
This is a return to one
of the major features of
the mercantilist system
which prevailed in the na-
tions of Europe after the
decay and fall of feudal-
ism. What is really new
in the world is the revo-
lutionary movement away
from that system toward a
system of free individual
enterprise.
The greatest exponent
and prophet of that new
order was Adam Smith,
whose "The Wealth of Na-
tions" appeared in the
year in which the Ameri-
can colonies adopted Jef-

ferson's Declaration of In-
dependence. The one re-
mains a classic statement
of the nature of economic
liberty; the other, of po-
litical liberty and inde-
pendence.
The kinship of the New
Frontier's economic ob-
jectives with the mercan-
tilism of the 17th and 18th
centuries is pointed out in
a short article in the cur-
rent issue of. Modern
Age by W. Allen Wallis,
an economist at the Uni-
versity of Chicago who is
to become the new presi-
dent of the University of
Rochester.
Among the many mani-
festations of this throw-
back to mercantilism is the
clamor over increasing the
"public" at the expense
of the "private" sector of
the economy.
Most of us will remem-
ber the great hullabaloo
in the 1960 campaign
about what was called
"private affluence and
public squalor." It was
claimed by a very dubious
statistical trick that the
Eisenhower administra-
tion had neglected the
"public sector" while pri-
vate individuals were
squandering their money
on luxuries. A sensation-
al book, "The Affluent So-
ciety," by John Kenneth
Galbraith, provided fodder
for innumerable campaign
speeches.
Kennedy post-election
plans and was rewarded
by appointment as ambas-
sador to India.
The claim of "neglect"
of the public sector dur-
ing the years preceding
1961 was grossly incorrect.
For the public sector en-
joyed an increase of spend-
ing greatly in excess of
the increase in military
and foreign aid.
★
But, as Wallis shows,
the whole concept of the
public sector as claimed by
the economists of the New
Frontier is spurious. For
vast expenditures have
been made by private
means on facilities and
services which are avail-
able to the public. The
"liberal" economists would
have us believe that noth-
ing belongs in the public
sector except what is paid
for by the government.
The real division be-
tween "public" and "pri-
vate" is not based upon
who pays for something,
but who enjoys access to
it. If I buy an automobile
for my personal use, I am
in the "private" sector.
But when I pay for a ride
in a taxi owned by the
driver or by a private
company, I am in the pub-
lic sector. For this service
is available to all.
A privately supported
hospital is a public facili-
ty, just as much as is a
veterans' hospital.
A curious characteristic
of the people whom Wal-
lis calls "social needers"
is that the intensity of
their effort to apply a "so-
lution" increases as the
problem declines in size
and importance.
The ultimate of such a
course as these New Fron-
tiersmen are promoting
would provide for free ev-
erything shared by the
public. Only the govern-
ment which provides these
bounties will be costly.
And its cost will dwarf
what is now spent by in-
dividuals in the private
sector.

Galbraith became a ma-
jor seer of the New Fron-
tier. We have heard his
ideas paraphrased in hun-
dreds of official state-
ments and speeches since
his book was published.
He was an architect of the
The end of such a
course is not socialism in
the traditional sense of
that philosophy. For there
would be no confiscation
of the means of produc-
tion. The new merchantil-
ism would continue pri-
vate ownership of produc-
tive facilities. It would
confiscate only the prod-
uct.
But whatever we may
call it, the end is the same;
the substitution of the
judgment of an elite for
that of the sum of millions
of individual choices.
