The Powell Case: Reform Urged in
Staffing of Congressional Groups
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Amazing abuse of the
proprieties of official con-
duct by the chairman of
the House Committee on
Education and Labor,
Adam Clayton Powell JÐ³.,
occasioned by his recent
European junket, has for-
tunately been exposed to
the newspaper readers of
the country.
There is little, however,
that the readers of that
garish story can do about
ridding Congress of this in-
dividual. For in his em-
pire in Harlem he is not
only lord temporal but
lord spiritual as well, be-
cause of his pastorate of
an immense Baptist
church. Nor can he be re-
moved from his powerful
chairmanship without up-
setting the cherished tra-
dition of seniority.
But if this fantastic in-
discretion can rivet the at-
tention of the public upon
the system under which
Powell can command such
power as a committee
chairman, it may be that
something can be done
about a reform which
some senators and repre-
sentatives have been de-
manding for a long time.
This reform concerns
adequate provisions for
committee staffs.
A month ago I had the
opportunity to talk with a
number of the minority
members of the staffs of
house committees. They
told me that while on
some committees the Dem-
ocratic chairmen and the
majority itself were per-
fectly fair in making staff
help available to the mi-
nority, there were other
committees in which the
chairmen and the major-
ity regarded these posi-
tions as purely political.
Those staff members
told me that Powell com-
pletely disregarded the
claims of the minority,
that he hired and fired
staff members on his own
initiative, that more than
40 staff members were par-
tisan and personal choices
of the chairman, and that
there were only two or
three members available
to the Republican minori-
ty.
What is really needed is
the enforcement of the
spirit and letter of the Leg-
islative Reorganization
Act of 1946, which was
sponsored by Sen. La Fol-
lette and House member
Monroney.
That act, which is the
law of the land, provides
that committee staffs be
appointed by the "majori-
ty vote of the committee"
and that the committee
staff members shall be ap-
pointed without regard to
their political affiliations.
The chairmen are author-
ized to fix the compensa-
tion of these staff people.
The spirit of the La Fol-
lette Monroney reform
was that there should be
developed adequate serv-
ice to committees and to
all, not just majority,
members of the commit-
tees. This reform envis-
aged the development of
expert Civil Service to
serve under all Congress-
es, regardless of political
changes.
In a notable speech on
Aug. 23, Sen. Hugh Scott
discussed this subject at
length. He pointed out that
this problem has become
more acute since the con-
gressional majority as well
as the executive passed
into Democratic hands. In
the Eisenhower years, dur-
ing most of which the Re-
publicans were in the
minority in Congress, Re-
publican members had
greater access to expert
help from the executive
departments. But now that
source of help is not avail-
able.
What is needed, there-
fore, is a full realization of
what was intended in the
La Follette-Monroney re-
form. This reform has
been on the books for 16
years and it is still far
from effective.
