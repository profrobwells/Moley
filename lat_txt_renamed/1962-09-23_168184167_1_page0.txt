Nixon Called a 'Loner,' the Type
of Man Who Makes Own Decision's
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
SAN FRANCISCO
In the campaign for gov-
ernor which is raging up
and down California, the
issue is and will continue
to be Richard M. Nixon.
This is in the nature of
things.
Gov. Brown is not a
striking or unusual figure.
He elicits no excitement
in either his supporters
or opponents. Estimates
of him range from that
propounded by his sup-
porters, as a hard-work-
ing, friendly individual, to
that of his opponents, as
a bumbling incompetent.
Nobody hates him. Few
are enthusiastic about him.
Nixon's enemies are bit-
ter, implacable and vocif-
erous. They have not
changed since 1948, when
as a young congressman
he exposed Alger Hiss.
Nixon's friends love him
not only for the drive and
dedication which carried
him so far in political life,
but for the enemies he has
made. The crowds who
hear him are large and en-
thusiastic because he is a
native Californian who at-
tained high status in the
nation and the world. In
short, he is a most inter-
esting candidate.

There are certain facts
about Nixon's methods
which need to be stated
frankly. I am fairly well
acquainted with almost
all of the people who
worked with him in the
campaign in 1960 and also
with those who are work-
ing with him this year. I
have discussed their prob-
lems with them many
times. They have talked
about their relationship
with him, their problems
in serving with him, and
their estimate of him as a
man and a public figure.
Their consensus is a
point made by Earl Mazo,
Nixon's biographer, who
spent two years in rather
close contact with Nixon
when he was Vice Presi-
dent. And I may add that
Mazo's point is my conclu-
sion also after knowing
Nixon well since the Hiss
case 14 years ago,
Mazo describes Nixon as
a "loner"â€”a man who lis-
tens to many, who seeks
and appreciates the advice
of many, but who makes
his own decisions, plots
his own course, and ac-
cepts responsibility.
Some of his helpers feel
frustrated at times when
he fails to follow their ad-
vice. They claim that he
should delegate more to
them. They say this, how-
ever, with no diminution
of their deep respect for
him and of their admira-
tion for his great ability.
But they all recognize
that this self-reliance is
in the very marrow of the
man. From boyhood, he
has had to make his way.
And it has not been easy.
One instance of this de-
termination to act on his
own was demonstrated at
the time when he was as-
signed by the President to
go to Moscow in 1959. The
State Department, follow-
ing a long-established rou-
tine, prepared a speech for
him to deliver at the
trade fair over there.
Nixon did not use this
speech. Instead, he labored
long into the night before
he left Washington, writ-
ing his own speech in
longhand. And that was
the speech he delivered.
It proved to be a mile-
stone in his career.
This trait might well be
weighed by the people of
California in their choice
of a governor. Certainly,
it is an asset which is
greatly admired in the
American tradition.
The voters who must
make the final choice can
be assured that Nixon as
governor will operate
through no privy council,
that when a policy is an-
nounced it will be his and
not that of a self-consti-
tuted mastermind behind
the scenes. Nobody will be
speaking for the "boss."
The "boss" will be the in-
dividual who bears the le-
gal title of governor.
Whatever is done, even
if there are mistakes, will
be the responsibility of
Nixon himself. This should
be considered a great as-
set in a governor. The
"boss" will be the man
who has been elected as
chief executive.
There will be no
"image" department creat-
ing illusions through pup-
licity "experts." Sacra-
mento will be a deadly cli-
mate for the proliferation
of ghosts, for peddlers of
influence, and for people
who aspire to be the pow-
er behind the scenes.
Perhaps what some who
have worked with Nixon
regard as his greatest lia-
bility should, when known
to the voters of the state,
prove to be his biggest as-
set.
