'Brinkmanship' of Dulles Might
Win Battle of Cuba for America
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It makes no sense to de-
lay action toward the So-
viet threat in Cuba on the
ground that its capability
is merely for defense. The
technical equipment and
personnel there probably
are already able to realize
many Communist objec-
tives in this hemisphere.
With radio and elec-
tronic mechanisms, it is
possible to conduct sur-
veillance over our military
operations. With such
equipment, our power to
retaliate in case of war
could be jammed, paralyz-
ing our defense.
Cape Canaveral, one of
the most vital spots in our
establishment, is less than
400 miles from Cuba.
It will also be possible
from this base to train and
infiltrate into Latin Amer-
ica agents, subversives
and saboteurs in great
numbers.
But President Kennedy
assures us that the pres-
ence of Soviet forces in
Cuba "does not constitute
a serious threat." We are
also expected to believe
that a "doomed" Castro is
"no longer feared in South
America."
It is not Castro who is
to be feared. It is the
mighty power which is
behind him. The guns that
defend can as easily attack.
Secretary of State Rusk,
plagued by remarks of
such Kennedy advisors as
Chester Bowles, com-
pounds the present con-
fusion surrounding the
Cuban question. In one
breath, he says, "Vigorous
debate is to be desired;"
in the next, that the prob-
lem should "not break it-
self up into alleged par-
tisan points of view." He
does admit, however, that
"no satisfactory answer
has yet been found and
that the penetration of
this hemisphere by Castro
communism is something
which cannot be accepted."
Is a "satisfactory" solu-
tion available? Anything
we do may be distasteful.
The cold war has been un-
pleasant for years. But it
must be faced.
Short of an invasion
directed by skilled mili-
tary men, rather than by
civilians who have
proven themselves ama-
teurs in such matters,
other courses are open.
The paralyzing fear of
conflict which numbs
reason can be replaced
by a firm resolve which
accepts calculated risks
— the "brinkmanship," if
you like, of John. Foster
Dulles.
It is not at the moment
necessary to declare a
blockade in the formal
manner described in clas-
sical international law.
For, according to George
Grafton Wilson, formerly
professor of international
law at Harvard, the term
"blockade" has been radi-
cally changed in the past
century.
★
Nor, in preventing fur-
ther build-up in Cuba, is
anything like a formal
declaration of war against
Cuba necessary. At any
rate, first steps can be
taken immediately. What
must be done later can be
decided according to devel-
opments.
We have at our disposal
the means to compel
NATO nations and others,
such as Liberia, to pre-
vent by official action the
further traffic in their
flagships between the So-
viet Union and Cuba. It is
within our power to cur-
tail foreign aid, to discrim-
inate against maritime
nations which are partici-
pating in such transporta-
tion. We can stop carry-
ing our foreign aid in their
ships.
Moreover, the United
States can prevent ships
used to supply Cuba from
bunkering in ports in the
western hemisphere. The
main bunkering stations
are Freeport in the Ba-
hamas, certain U.S. ports,
Venezuela and ports in
Panama. Pressure against
the foreign owners of
those ports, and also
official action regarding
American ports, will make
it difficult, if not impos-
sible, for ships bound to
Cuba to return across the
Atlantic.
Also we can, with our
Navy on the high seas and
without a formal blockade,
stop the transportation of
anything to other nations
in Latin America from
Cuba.
After these preliminary
steps are taken, there
would be time to consider
more drastic moves. But
these should be taken
without further delay.
