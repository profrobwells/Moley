Decisions, Decisions---
That's President's Lot
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Several weeks ago one
of President Kennedy's
apologists wrote in his
column that the election
of 1962 presented the
Chief Executive with a
grave dilemma:
I he kept himself aloof
this year on the ground
that critical foreign
matters demanded his
full attention, organiza-
tion Democrats everywhere
would ascribe their
failures to lack of Presidential support.
If he actively took the
stump, he risked the consequences
of supporting
candidates who would go
down to defeat in November.
Of the two risks, he
accepted the latter.
But once he had decided
to campaign, he faced a
number of torturing
decisions.
What was he to say?
Should he support some
Democrats and ignore
other Democrats? That
would make for more
Democratic opposition to
his policies in the 88th
Congress.
Could he repeat the old
arguments for Medicare,
an Urban Affairs Department,
etc., arguments that
have failed ever since he
first made them two years
ago? Could he speak reassurance
to and of business
without alienating
the labor leaders to whom
he owes so much?
The fact is that he must
depend almost entirely
upon the AFL-CIO to
fight for his congressional
supporters where the real
Democratic Party is weak.
This is especially true in
the South where the
elimination of recalcitrant
conservatives must be
accomplished in the primaries
rather than in
elections.
Could he praise his
party in Congress when it
failed to respond to most
of his program? Could he
claim fiscal responsibility
when his promised 1963
surplus had turned into
an immense deficit?
And can he venture to
campaign in the South
where the Mississippi affair
has further alienated
so many hitherto loyal
Democrats?
★
As it has turned out so
far, his campaign utterances
have been a hodge-podge
of generalities, interspersed
with digs at
Republicans as a species.
He promised a tax cut next
year before he started on
the campaign routine but
he cannot spell this out
appealingly now for the
simple reason that his administration
hasn't the
slightest idea of what
taxes should be cut and
whose tax bill will be
lightened.
What real satisfaction
can the President and his
brother Bobby, who are
hard realists, get from the
applause of crowds pre-fabricated
by Democratic
machines?
And from the throngs
that turn out from that innate
curiosity which impels
people to try to look
at a President, every President,
any President?
Or from the shouts that
greet his rather corny
efforts to be funny?
What does he really
think of some of the candidates
he must embrace?
What eloquence can evoke
or what pageantry can
whet enthusiasm for such
aspirants as the pathetic
Morgenthau in New York,
the fumbling DiSalle in
Ohio, or the colorless
Brown in California?
And in Ohio can he bestow
praise upon Sen.
Frank Lausche who voted
against his measures more
times than a majority of
Senate Republicans?
Above all, how can he
talk about foreign affairs
—the subject which in the
public mind transcends
all domestic concerns?
These matters he has so
far failed to stress.
There are several good
reasons for this omission.
His administration has
failed to provide any effective
means to meet those
issues.
And there is no political
or oratorical mileage in
telling crowds that these
subjects are "being studied,"
as he tells reporters
in press conferences. For
the man in the street assumes
that there has been
plenty of time for study
and the time has come for
action.
It is not this administration
which has sought
effectively to prevent foreign
flag ships, most of
them from nominally
friendly powers such as
Britain and Greece, from
carrying stuff from the
Soviet Union to Cuba. It
is the maritime unions.
Also the inactions and
ineptitude of the United
States have emboldened
midget nations to join
Castro in hurling defiance
at the American colossus.
Witness Panama, which
was a creation of an
American President, Theodore
Roosevelt, and which
has been under our protection
ever since.
Witness the new government
of Algeria, whose
independence Sen. Kennedy
supported; hurling
defiance at us.
And in Africa the joint
confusion of the United
States and the United Nations
has antagonized both
the so-called government
of the Congo and its opponents
in Katanga.
Most regrettable is the
unwillingness of Britain
and France to recognize
what Cuba means to us
and incidentally to themselves.
They have forgotten
that in two great wars
our aid rescued them from
defeat.
★
The one achievement of
the Kennedy barnstorming
so far has been a source
of great satisfaction, not to
the Democrats but the Republicans.
It has stirred
Gen. Eisenhower into action
as a fighting, slugging
Republican.
