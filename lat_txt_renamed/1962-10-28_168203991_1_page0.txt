U.S. Public Triggered
Action Against Castro
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The military and political consequences, even the
immediate ones, of the
President's seven-point
Cuban program are incalculable. Consequently this
commentator has no predictions to offer.
But I believe it is clear
that those people, including the President, who
were trying to keep this
issue out of the political
campaign were far off the
mark.
This Cuban affair has
been a valid issue ever
since the tragic invasion
18 months ago. It has been
the major issue since
Americans learned from
the press, not the administration, of the Soviet takeover. That was during the
summer.
A great fear then spread
over the land. This apprehension on the part of the
American people made everything the President
was saying about Medicare, the candidates, and
the need to elect more
Democrats wholly unrealistic and incongruous.

Perhaps former President Eisenhower was
aware of the impending
crisis when he said the
Republicans should not
make an issue of Cuba. If
so, he spoke from knowledge.
If not, his advice was
unwise. For all over the
country leaders of his
party have stressed the
matter with the enthusiastic approval of the people who listened to them.
Those leaders knew that
there was at least three
months ago a real and
present danger and they
demanded action of some
kind.
In this instance the public, so often wrong in the
past, was absolutely right.
In 1898, when we went to
war for Cuba, public opinion, whipped up by an irresponsible press, was
wrong. President McKinley most reluctantly called
for war under the pressure
of Congress and certain
members of his administration.
"Remember the Maine"
was the slogan. But, there
was then and is now no
proof that the Spanish had
blown up our battleship.
Even McKinley's great
friend, Sen. Mark Hanna,
opposed going to war. But
as Margaret Leach shows
in her fine book, "In the
Days of McKinley," Congress would have declared
war in any event even if
McKinley had not asked
for it.
The circumstances were
different in 1917 and
1941. The public and the
Congress were divided on
both of those occasions.
The peril to us from Germany was remote and debatable.
President Wilson
watched and waited until
Germany threatened our
maritime rights and then
he justified intervention
on the idealistic ground
that we should make the
world "safe for democracy." That was a dream
that never came true.
In 1940 and 1941 President Roosevelt hesitated
until Pearl Harbor left no
other course than to accept war.
But in this instance
there has been no hysteria
in the press and only occasionally irrational demands in the press for direct military action. But
the American people who
were capable of making a
judgment demanded action of some kind to frustrate the Soviet build-up.
Americans do not equate
what happens in Cuba with
what happens in the
Far East or Eastern Europe or even Berlin. Cuba
Castro
is within the very close
perimeter of our interests. For more than a century it has been a major
concern to us.
After the Spanish-American War and until 1902
we occupied the island,
put it in order, helped
it to establish free institutions and, when we left,
we reserved by the Platt
Amendment the right to
intervene whenever free
institutions were endangered. At that time we
also reserved our base at
Guantanamo.
The effect of this action
by the President on the
political campaign cannot
be predicted. However, Republican candidates can
and will continue to say
that the action was long
overdue and that earlier
measures would have effectively prevented the establishment of the offensive power which is now
in Cuba.
They can also claim that
it was their insistent demands that moved the
President to action at this
time.
★
Therefore there will be
no complete moratorium
on any discussion of the
matter by candidates. For
in this instance, the public, not the President,
made the issue, and it is
now for the voters to register the final judgment.
But all of us will back
the President in serving
notice on the Kremlin that
we are prepared militarily
and psychologically for
anything that may come
of this crisis.
