Ideological Divisions That Split
America Will Continue Into 1964
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the tumult and the
shouting cease, while
tattered campaign posters
flutter in the November
winds like withered
leaves, party managers
face the problem of pay-
ing off their deficits, and
Americans give their undi-
vided attention to Cuba
and their own jobs, it is
time to consider with cool
heads and disciplined
emotions those political
issues which remain un-
changed.
Those who read trends
this way or that way into
the election results should
bear in mind that such in-
dicators of things to come
are capricious and incon-
stant.
Public opinion will shift
with many circumstances
between now and the 1964
Presidential campaign. Also,
it must be remembered
that this was not one elec-
tion but many. Results in
states and congressional
districts were measurably
dictated by local condi-
tions and personal consid-
erations.
Some of the results were
determined in the last
hours before the polling
on Tuesday. All the poll-
sters and all the political
dope peddlers are unable
to read what went on in
the minds of those voters
who provided the margin
between victory and de-
feat.
There are weeks ahead
during which the results
can be analyzed. At the
moment, however, it can
be noted with confidence
that the broad ideological
issues which divide Amer-
icans will remain for the
next two years and prob-
ably for many to come
after that. These stand
fast.
Marking the two ends
of the ideological spec-
trum are what are called
the extremists of the left
and the right. Those who
under the name "liberal"
would promote vast new
powers for the govern-
ment at home and ap-
peasement abroad, and
those who would use ex-
treme measures to check
such trends may be negli-
gible so far as voting
strength is concerned.
But because they are
extremely articulate they
get vast attention in the
news. To be moderate is
to be gray and unnews-
worthy. The headlines con-
cern themselves with those
who overstate their case.
During this campaign
much was heard of the ex-
tremists on both sides.
Democrats were at pains
to attribute to their Re-
publican opponents affilia-
tion with or support by
"the extreme right," or
Birchism, or the Birch So-
ciety itself.
Republicans countered
with claims that their op-
ponents followed the line
of the Americans for Dem-
ocratic Action or that they
were "soft on commu-
nism."
The groundwork for
this had been laid by the
attention that these ex-
tremists have received
from the press and com-
ments on the airwaves.
However, it must be noted
that among those who
have had access to the
public prints and other
media of communication
there has been vastly more
castigation of the extreme
right than of its counter-
part, the extreme left.
As a corrective of this
imbalance, there has ap-
peared a small book, "The
Fringe on Top." Its author
is the very articulate and
sound conservative editor
of the Indianapolis News,
M. Stanton Evans.
In the preparation of
this indictment of the ex-
treme left Evans had the
assistance of Allan H. Rys-
kind and William Shultz.
They contend quite cor-
rectly, that since the "radi-
cal right" has been so se-
verely castigated it is es-
sential that an examina-
tion be made of the or-
ganizations and individ-
uals who have been active
in the ADA and also those
who in their expressions
on foreign affairs have ad-
vocated dangerous ap-
peasement of the Commu-
nist powers.
The book makes the
valid point that the
"fringe on the left" is more
dangerous than the
"fringe on the right," he-
cause so many of its mem-
bers are now also mem-
bers of the Kennedy ad-
ministration. They are
not, according to this book,
"clamoring to get into
power." They are already
there.
While these fringes to
the left and the right are,
as I have often noted in
what I have written, an
unfortunate burden to be
carried by sound and rea-
sonable members of both
political parties, they do
serve a useful purpose.
Like the fleas that bar a
dog from over-indulgence
in sleep, they remind all
of us that there is a pro-
foundly important division
among Americans about
national policies.
While the judgment and
methods of the extremists
may be deplored, they do
serve to awaken us to real-
ities. This election, howev-
er, has proved that the
bulk of the voting popula-
tion did not favor extrem-
ists on either side.
Carroll in Colorado lost
to a moderate conserva-
tive. In Pennsylvania,
Scranton's record in his
first and only term in Con-
gress indicated that he is
not the most conservative
Republican but ranks well
in the upper third. Where
Democrats won, such as
Morrison in Nebraska and
Dempsey in Connecticut,
the voters recognized com-
petent and able Democrat-
ic governors who were not
too closely associated with
the liberal wing of their
party. This is a measure of
satisfaction to those who
want to avoid extremes on
both sides.
