My fellow citizens:
This is a short discourse
on you and your taxes. It
is addressed to all Ameri-
cans of voting age.
Almost half of you did
not take the trouble to vote
for your representatives in
Congress at the recent
election. Therefore, al-
though your cries for low-
er taxes are piercing and
piteous, you don't deserve
any relief.
Of those of you who
voted, one half chose to
return the members of the
present Congress to office,
most of whom had voted
to tax you for innumer-
able fool proposals to
spend our money. So you,
too, don't deserve any tax
relief.
Please don't delude
yourselves into believing
that the politicians whom
you have elected, includ-
ing the chief magistrate
whom you elected two
years ago, have failed to
note that you have not
cared much about your
taxes, despite your weep-
ing and wailing.
Also, please don't be-
lieve them when they say
that next year you are go-
ing to get a break. You
won't get it, because you
really haven't cared
enough about it to elect
people who will give it to
you.
I realize that these
harsh comments are not
going to make me popular
with most of you. That
gives me no concern at all.
For over the years in these
essays I have said so many
unpopular things that it is
a wonder I have not been
thrown out of your news-
paper.
But people are still
printing what I write and
I am getting paid for it.
I am eating three times a
day, have a roof over my
head, and have a little laid
by. The latter, however,
will be worth only half of
what it is now if you keep
voting or non-voting as
you do.
It will be quite a race
between my savings and
my animate being.
Here are some more un-
pleasant facts to read, if
indeed you have read this
far.
This year about 100 mil-
lion Americans will file
individual income tax re-
turns, about the same
number as those who have
the legal privilege of vot-
ing. These will account
for about 70 million de-
pendents.
We individual income
tax payers will be bitten
for about $49 billion. Cor-
porations will pay about
$23 billion more. And
those corporations must
add that sum to the price
of everything you buy. So
you will be paying that,
too.
And you will pay an ad-
ditional $10 billion in ex-
cise taxes.
Then there are, in addi-
tion and outside the reg-
ular president's budget,
$3.4 billion in excise tax-
es for the highway pro-
gram. Those who use gas-
oline will pay that also.
Finally, most of you
will pay $15.4 million in
employment taxes for the
social security program.
And this should remind
you that when you get
some of it back in the fu-
ture, the dollars will be
worth about half of what
they are worth now. Be-
cause all this income will
not satisfy the appetite of
the administration and
Congress for money. They
will run a deficit, which
means inflation.
To make matters still
more unpleasant for all of
us, our tax system falls
more heavily on some
than on others.
Anybody can tell you
that many individuals—
rich, poor, and middle peo-
ple—are not carrying
their share of the tax
pack. Some must work
while some will shirk.
This tax pack on our
collective back hurts some
places so much as to cause
painful soreness. And so
there are heart-breaking
cries for readjustment.
Complete revision is long
overdue.
But what has your Con-
gress done about this un-
fair distribution of the
load?
In the late 1940s there
were four revenue acts
passed by Congress reduc-
ing taxes. But most of
those abolished wartime
levies which were no long-
er needed, even by a gov-
ernment which never
seems to get enough.
The House Committee
on Ways and Means
(which, incidentally, is a
very conscientious and
hardworking committee)
worked two years to cre-
ate a fine tax revision
measure. The House
passed it and the Senate
rejected it. Then came the
Korean war, and taxes
were raised again.
Finally, in 1954, we had
a Congress which gave us
a big break and reduced
taxes by $7.4 billion. But
in the election that year
you, the voters, turned on
that Congress as if it were
made up of thieves and
poltroons. Out it went.
And since then, four
successive Congresses
have not had the nerve to
do what the 1954 Con-
gress was punished for.
Now don't be deluded
with talk about a nice tax
cut next year.
Do you expect the new
Congress to act any dif-
ferently from those we
have had? That, as Adlai
Stevenson said about an
elated expectation of an
easy Cuban settlement,
would be "the triumph of
hope over experience."
