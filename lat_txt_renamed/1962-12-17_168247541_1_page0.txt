Ellender's Services Are Forgotten
as One-Worlders Denounce Him
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Before the One-World
zealots go much further
in denouncing Sen. Allen
J. Ellender, the great serv-
ices of this Louisianian
should be considered.
It seems that a number
of comic-opera govern-
ments have closed the
gates of their jungles
against the senator. Their
potentates say that he said
that so far as he had been
able to determine, they
have made no progress to-
ward self-government
since they hoisted the flags
of independence. And so,
instead of welcoming him
and showing evidence that
he might be wrong, a num-
ber of them decided to
keep him out.
Unnamed spokesmen in
Washington have declared
themselves to be "deeply
disturbed." What they
ought to be disturbed
about is their own irre-
sponsible action in order-
ing Michel Struelens, an
official representative of
Katanga, out of the United
States.
They ought to be dis-
turbed also by the unbe-
lievable waste of Ameri-
can money in our aid to
emergent and incompetent
nations in Asia and Africa.
Perhaps such a judg-
ment of the African states
is a violation of the nice-
ties of diplomacy. For de-
spite their own doubts,
diplomatic spokesmen
must hail these dictator-
ships as wonderful exam-
ples of free institutions at
work.
But Sen. Ellender is no
diplomat. As a senator he
conceives himself to be re-
sponsible for the money
of American taxpayers.
And over the years he has
met that responsibility
better than any of his col-
leagues.
*
His time and energy
have been spent, whenever
his duties in Washington
have permitted, in visiting
the countries of the world.
His reports of what he has
seen have been most illum-
inating and helpful to our
taxpayers and to Congress.
Mr. Bell, our new dis-
tributor of aid, would prof-
it by a study of the Ellen-
der reports. This senator,
well past the age of 65, has
visited scores of countries,
braving the perils of cli-
mate, food, and disease in
pursuit of his duty.
For example, on one of
his visits to Korea he
found that our almsgiver
there had built certain
flour mills. When Ellender
questioned this man, he
found that the Koreans
raised no wheat, and that
he was urging them to ex-
port their rice and import
wheat. This was in the in-
terest of his theories about
the Korean diet.
That Ellender's warning
about such nonsense was
ignored is now demon-
strated by a recent two-
volume report by Comp-
troller General Campbell.
It shows that from 1957
to 1961 the United States
spent $1.2 billion which
Korea was too incompetent
to use. Poor planning and
administration were quite
general. Monumental
waste and blunders were
common. More than $250
million went into the im-
portation of fertilizer.
To spend this staggering
sum, our mission had "one
American and one Ko-
rean." The ICA admitted
that it had little knowledge
of needs and was unable to
get from the Koreans any
idea of how the money
had been spent.
Funds were used to im-
port cotton and soybeans
which Korea might well
have raised within its own
borders. Vast amounts
spent for luxury items
such as nylon and fine
woolens not only were un-
necessary but impeded Ko-
rea's development of its
own industry.
â˜…
Wholesale stealing of
military supplies, gasoline
and automotive parts was
common. Laxity of the
Bank of Korea in the allo-
cation of aid dollars "en-
couraged speculation and
led to a number of irregu-
larities, such as collusion
between supplier and im-
porter, shipment of defec-
tive merchandise, kick-
backs and over-pricing."
A dreary recital of Ko-
rean practices, from chron-
ic corruption to usurious
interest rates, is included
in the report. These prac-
tices perpetuated heavy
debt, low living standards,
and minimal purchasing
power; yet it was found
that the ICA had not fa-
miliarized itself with them.
But the millions of our
dollars are still pouring in.
