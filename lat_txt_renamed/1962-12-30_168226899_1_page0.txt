Unorganized Workers Are Minor
Concern to the Labor Department
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the past few years,
and especially since the
coming of the Kennedy ad-
ministration, the major
role of the secretary of la-
bor has been in relations
between management
and organized labor.
But only one-third of
the non-agricultural work-
ing force and one-quarter
of the total labor force are
organized in unions. The
preoccupation and sympa-
thies of the labor secretary
really mean that he is sec-
retary of organized labor.
Who, then, is concerned
with the great majority of
wage earners?
One official of a large
corporation has suggested
that perhaps there should
be a new cabinet member.
—a secretary of unorgan-
ized labor.
*
This brings up the old
question about the role
that certain cabinet mem-
bers should play.
Until the time when the
secretary of agriculture
appeared in the cabinet in
1889, the various members
thereof were concerned
with functions of govern-
ment. They were in no
sense representing large
specific interests in the
population. But a certain
representative character
has been imparted to the
later additions of com-
merce, labor, and health,
education and welfare.
Just how that represent-
ative character should be
exercised is not clear.
Should these later addi-
tions to the cabinet be con-
sidered as spokesmen in
the administration in be-
half of the interests in-
volved? Or should they
speak to and make con-
tacts with those private
interests in behalf of the
administration of which
they are a part? Perhaps
the answer to these ques-
tions is that they are act-
ing in both capacities. But
the line of demarcation
has never been clear.

They are also the execu-
tive heads of large admin-
istrative departments with
tens of thousands of em-
ployees. But that is inci-
dental to their activities.
For as one former depart-
ment head has said, his
real authority over the em-
ployees in his department
was negative.
He was allowed fewer
than a hundred, out of tens
of thousands of his nomi-
nal employees, whom he
could hire and fire on his
own responsibility. The
rest had tenure under civil
service.

The 10 cabinet officers
are really counsellors to be
used by the President in
determining over-all na-
tional policy. They are
spokesmen before the pub-
lic for the President. They
are dealing with vast mat-
ters which reach far be-
yond their departments or,
in the case of the four I
have mentioned, the pri-
vate interests involved.
In these larger aspects
of the responsibilities of
the secretary of labor, the
business community is con-
vinced that the sympathies
and influence of the three
most recent incumbents of
the office, Messrs. Mitch-
ell, Goldberg and Wirtz,
have turned the scales
wherever possible on the
side of organized labor.
In disputes on the West
Coast, the administration
acting through the secre-
tary of labor has been on
the side of the unions that
are seeking union shops in
the big defense plants.
In the California cases
the fact-finding board was
headed by an individual
who was shown by his pre-
vious writings to be a par-
tisan of the union shop in
industry. The individual
who headed the fact-find-
ing board assigned to Boe-
ing likewise took the side
of the unions rather than
that of the non-union
workers and the company.
These people were ap-
pointees of the President,
but such selections could
hardly have been made ex-
cept by either nomination
or approval of the secre-
tary of labor.
My contentions here
would be answered by the
assertion that in the Labor
Department itself the ma-
jority of the bureaus are
concerned with wage earn-
ers generally. But these
bureaucratic services are
incidental to the power
and influence of the secre-
tary himself.
*
The unorganized major-
ity is politically impotent.
It is therefore without
power to demand adequate
recognition by political ad-
ministrations.
The unions, most of
which are having hard go-
ing these days in maintain-
ing their membership,
have political potency.
Therefore, they have the
major share of the govern-
ment’s attention.
