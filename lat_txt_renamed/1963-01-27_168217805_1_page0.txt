Why Russians Pulled
Out of New York Fair
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The eternal frustrations
in our relations with the
Soviet Union are not en-
tirely due to the obstinate
nature of that govern-
ment. Some are due to the
clumsy methods of our
State Department.
This is well illustrated
in the breaking of the
Soviet agreement to estab-
lish an exhibit at the New
York world's fair in 1964.
A combination of the
inept diplomacy directed
by the "fourth floor"
bureaucracy in the State
Department, along with
the traditional suspicions
of Soviet officials, was
displayed in a long story of
negotiations running back
two years.
Early in the planning of
the world's fair—which, it
should be stressed, is not a
government but a private
enterprise—the Soviets
agreed to bring over a
large exhibit. All arrange-
ments were duly made as
to the area to be occupied
by the Soviet pavilion and
the conditions under
which it should be oper-
ated.

But the Soviets asked
that we reciprocate by
promising to have a U.S.
exhibit at the world's fair
in Moscow in 1967. The
State Department then
entered the picture with
an objection that it could
not guarantee this because
the funds therefore would
have to be appropriated
by Congress.
However, the Soviets
later announced that they
had abandoned the idea of
a fair in 1967. Thereupon,
the State Department im-
posed a condition that the
United States could in
1965 or later erect pavi-
lions with our exhibits in
Moscow and Leningrad.
This seems like a strange
request because, if the
State Department could
not be sure of getting
Congress to approve an
exhibit at a 1967 fair in
Moscow, how could it be
assured of the money for
the two pavilions?
In any event, the So-
viets objected to the
American pavilions.
Since these conditions
seemed wholly irrelevant
to the matter of participa-
tion in the 1964 New York
world's fair, Robert Moses
and Charles Poletti,
charged with the interna-
tional side of the fair,
persuaded the State De-
partment to drop the con-
dition that there be pavi-
lions in Russia.
Meanwhile, the Soviets
asked that they be per-
mitted to send architects
and engineers to plan the
structure for the New York
fair, and this permission
was officially granted.
This brings us to Sep-
tember 30, 1962. Suddenly,
Moses was notified that
the Soviets' all-union
chamber of commerce had
decided not to participate
in the New York fair.
Poletti immediately
planned to visit Moscow to
attempt to persuade the
Russians to change their
mind. Because of the Cu-
ban crisis, he delayed his
trip until December.
While there, he con-
ferred with various auth-
orities and sought to meet
new objections which
were raised. One of these
was the fear that the
exhibit would be molested
or subjected to undue
criticism by Americans.
Another was the fact that
time was running short.
Poletti provided suffi-
cient assurance on these
points. But no new deci-
sion was reached.
On his return to New
York, Poletti had various
friendly conferences with
Soviet officials. These offi-
cials, including the new
Soviet ambassador, were
most friendly, but
of course they could not
speak with authority for
their government in Mos-
cow.
That is where the mat-
ter now stands.
It would be most unfor-
tunate for all concerned
not to have the Russians
participate in this great
international exhibition.
Such a demonstration of
their peaceful achieve-
ments to the millions who
would visit the fair would
be the most favorable way
to break through Ameri-
can officialdom to the
people of the United
States. It would be the
best of all forms of public
relations.
