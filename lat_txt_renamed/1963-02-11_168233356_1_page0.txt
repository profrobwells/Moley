A Lesson From Prof. Wayout: How
to Spend Your Way to Prosperity
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The idea came to Ace
Divider, class of '40, as he
sat at his desk in Febru-
ary, 1963, frowning at the
financial calculations
which plainly told him
that, come April, he would
once more have to borrow
to meet his tax bill. "Here
I am again," he thought,
"short as usual. It's always
the same, no matter how
good my intentions are."
As he puzzled, frag-
ments of his past came to
mind-the days before he
had a fairly good practice
as an architect, a growing
family, a circle of friends
in his profession. "When
I was back on the old
campus, I never figured
that I would have finan-
cial troubles."
*
Then the idea struck
him. "Say," he muttered,
"My old économics profes-
sor ought to be able to
help me solve this prob-
lem. I'll drive up there and
see him tomorrow."
And so, refreshed and
assured, encouraged by his
wife, he left his three-bed-
room ranch house early
next morning, and three
hours later drove his 1960
moderately priced automo-
bile through the inviting
gates of Alma Mater. The
days when a bright future
beckoned came back, along
with the regret that life
should have proved such
a rat race with debt. But
here, he believed, would
be hope, and he entered
the social science building.
A secretary told him
that his old professor had
retired some years before.
"Prof. Wayout heads the
department now," she said.
"He always enjoys meet-
ing any of the old alumni.
This way, please."
¥
Ace found himself in an
office facing a desk which
he noted was as untidy as
his own. Behind the desk
Prof. Wayout greeted him
pleasantly. Thus encour-
aged, Ace explained the
purpose of his visit and
his need for advice.
The professor listened
attentively, tapping a red
pencil idly on a blue vol-
ume entitled, as Ace could
see, "Economic Report of
the President." At the con-
clusion of his sad narra-
tive, Ace added that he
could not see why with a
substantial income his ex-
penses always left him
with a deficit at tax time.
At this, Prof. Wayout re-
plied with some emphasis,
"Ah! But you must realize
that times have changed
since your college days.
Your debts aren't big
enough. They are there-
fore bad debts. You must
think in terms of years.
This year you can run
pretty, deep into the red.
All right. Borrow. Don't
worry about a big debt
which will bring in a big-
ger income. Big debts are
good debts. I can assure
you that you will make it
up in the future.
"You are driving a car
that lacks class. Turn it
over to your wife and get
one of those big ones that
have prestige written all
over them. Move into a
larger house in a better
suburb. The people you
will know will be better
prospects. And by all
means join a first-rate
golf club where you will
play with people who are
successful and planning
expansion in their plant.
You can see where a good
architect enters that pic-
ture."
*
Ace said warily, "You
mean that I can spend my-
self into prosperity?"
"Exactly! Not just you.
Your wife can help. Hire
a cook and get your wife
a new mink coat. Send
your children to better
schools. Through them
you will meet well-to-do
parents. Entertain more at
your home. Spending be-
comes all-important now-
adays."
Behind the professor
there were displayed on
the wall various profes-
sional items-a certificate
from the London School
of Economics and a grad-
uate diploma from Har-
vard. There was also an
autographed photograph
of the major figure in the
New Frontier.
Prof. Wayout picked up
the copy of the President's
economic report and hand-
ed it to Ace. "Read this.
The concept behind my
advice to you is all ex-
plained in this, with ir-
refutable proof. Keep this
copy. I have several more.
I am called to Washing-
ton frequently for consul-
tation by friends on the
staff of the President's
economic advisers. Like
many other people in the
social sciences, I live a
sort of double life. Part
time in government, and
the rest teaching what I
learn there."
*
Ace glanced at a framed
photograph of the former
department head, his old
professor. Prof. Wayout
commented, "You see, it
was different in his days
when you were here tak-
ing his course in eco-
nomics. Fine chap. But old
hat, you know."
As Ace rose and moved
toward the door Prof.
Wayout came from behind
the desk and extended his
hand. "Another suggestion.
Why not take your wife
to Florida for 10 days? Fly
now. Pay later. A good
coat of tan will help. And
I hope you won't mind my
suggestion. A new ward-
robe is in order. Those
lapels are a bit wide."
Ace walked into the
cold February day. But
within he already felt
the warm Florida sun.
