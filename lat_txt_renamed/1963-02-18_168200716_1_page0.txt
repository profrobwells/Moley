'Progressive Era' Changes Hinder
Runners in the Presidential Race
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The point of this piece
is not to add to the volume
of useless speculation
about a Republican Presi-
dential candidate in 1964,
but to offer some observa-
tions on what is some-
times called progress.
For two sorts of pro-
gressive change limit seri-
ously the capacity of aspir-
ants to achieve that
coveted nomination. One
has to do with changes
in the laws which were
enacted mostly in what
was called the progressive
era, half a century ago.
*
The other marks of
progress appear in phys-
ical means of communica-
tion and transportation.
Since the latter have
been the product of sci-
ence and engineering
and have been accepted
as wonderful by all con-
cerned, we can't do much
about them. But so far as
the laws are concerned
and their effects after 50-
odd years of trial, we may
be warned that we should
in accepting reforms let
our brains rather than our
emotions guide us.
Back in the years ex-
tending roughly from the
election of William H.
Taft in 1908 to the sink-
ing of the Lusitania in
1915, when our hearts
were young and gay and
agriculture supported us
rather than vice versa,
we decided to do some-
thing about our political
institutions. Brilliant fig-
ures fired our imagina-
tions with denunciations
of the "old order" and the
need for more "deтос-
racy."
*
Some of them inspired
me then and still elicit
my admiration, despite
what came of their plans.
Among those figures might
be mentioned Robert M.
LaFollette, Charles Evans
Hughes, Hiram Johnson,
and Woodrow Wilson.
The core of their philos-
ophy was that representa-
tive government had failed
us, that big business was
bad, and that political par-
ties were run by evil men.
The remedy, they told
us, was to let the people
nominate public officials
directly and to shackle
the political parties so that
they would have no fur-
ther responsibility for our
public servants.
There were substantial
elements of truth in the
indictment. But the reme-
dies proposed failed to
take into account the old-
est political fact in the
world, the mental and
moral limitations of pure
democracy limitations
which were amply deline-
ated in the writings of
philosophers from
Aristotle to the authors of
The Federalist.
But the illusion caught
fire and swept the nation.
Such slogans were used
as "The cure for the evils
of democracy is more
democracy," and "the trou-
ble with democracy is that
it doesn't democ."
*
Among the many leg-
islative changes born of
this crusade was the di-
rect election of delegates
to national conventions
and, in a dozen states,
the Presidential primary.
The latter so excited even
such a stable intellect as
that of Woodrow Wilson.
that he predicted that aft-
er 1912 we might never
need another national con-
vention except to pass a
few resolutions. The nom-
inating would be done in
primaries in the various
states.
However, the movement
for Presidential primar-
ies died out after the first
world war.
I cannot understand
why even Wilson could
not see that if all states
had Presidential primar-
ies it would be physical-
ly impossible for aspir-
ants to visit them all. But
it seems to be the rule
now that an aspirant must
campaign actively in one
or a few. This takes mon-
ey and energy.
*
An aspirant must also
create a popular demand
by stumping in many oth-
er states, since the party
organizations are general-
ly so weakened by "pro-
gressive" laws that they
are unable to make a
considered selection them-
selves. Vast public rela-
tions operations are need-
ed. Also, there are hired
pollsters to employ not
only in the primaries but
in the campaign after the
nomination.
When a President is to
be a candidate for renom-
ination or, as in Richard
Nixon's case, he occupies
a unique position as the
President's favorite, such
activities are unnecessary.
But aspirants in a party
out of power have all these
necessities to fulfill. They
must have a large personal
fortune or have financial
sources which will be
heavy liabilities after elec-
tion.
New methods of com-
munication and transpor-
tation not only require
great sums of money but
create demands which can
be met only by a man of
immense physical and
gastronomic capabilities.
So the candidate in 1964,
it seems, should be under
55 and should be willing to
give his time for a year or
more to the task. If he has
a public responsibility
now, he must neglect it.
Also, he must be photo-
genic on television and a
capable actor before
crowds. His conscience
must be able to bend like
a fiberglass vauiting pole.
*
Amid such require-
ments, proved intellectual
capacities and experience
in large affairs are rela-
tively unimportant. Peo-
ple are nominated to be
elected, and they must be
chosen democratically.
And so the progressive
ideal, which was to take
money power out of pol-
itics, has made money in-
dispensable much
money, lavishly spent.
