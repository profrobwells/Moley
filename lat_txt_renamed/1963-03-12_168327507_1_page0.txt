How Hoover Men Helped F.D.R. to
Save the Nation's Banking System
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Your devoted commentator, sometime servant of
Franklin D. Roosevelt and
a participant in the activities of March 4, 1933, has
observed a rule recommended to all senior citizens,
which is to permit
anniversaries to pass without note.
My physician, whom I
visit twice a year and who
ministers to many elderly
ladies and gentlemen, has
a poem posted in his office
which says, in effect,
"Forget the past. Reminiscence is a disease of the
elderly."
With this in mind and
with Mr. Kennedy's merry
crew providing rich pasturage for an active journalist,
I decided to skip
this 30th anniversary of
those days when the
banks rose from the
wreckage and the nation
awakened from a winter of
austerity.
Indeed, I have recently
declined to appear on
certain programs designed
to commemorate those
battles long ago.
I realize that I was
asked not because of my
screen appeal but because
I might provide interest
for antiquarians.

But during the past
week, what with inclement March weather, I
sought entertainment indoors with my television
set. There on at least two
programs I witnessed a
number of esteemed individuals whom I knew well
three decades ago, blinking in the light of another
man-made sun risen at
twilight.
These individuals were
subjected to questions by
impresarios whose knowledge of history was like
Sam Weller's acquaintance with London, "extensive but peculiar." The
general performance was
such that the tortured
goddess of history cried
out in agony.
And so, without further
ado, I would remind another generation of certain
events of which they are
the more or less unhappy
heirs.
None of the individual
witnesses who survived
those days and appeared
on those programs was
close to the heart of affairs
in March 1933 except
Henry Wallace and Rex
Tugwell, and they were
busy with the Department
of Agriculture and not
with the two central matters which I shall note.
Most had not even met Mr.
Roosevelt at that time.
All seemed concerned
with vague philosophical
speculations about history's niche for the major
figure of that time and
with comparing those
days with these. That is to
compare the incomparable.
But what concerned me
most was the lugubrious
nature of their descriptions of those days. The
climate was not sad at all.
It was not a moment for
weeping. The locusts had
not devoured the land.
If the court please, I rise
to say that it was a most
joyous time in Washington. A long winter was
approaching its end. The
buds were waiting in the
branches. The sap was
rising in the trees. And
the saps who came later
were not yet crowding the
trains and highways. The
time had not arrived when
they would be flailing
about with great but mis-
directed "vigah."
Even before the new
President took the oath, a
small team of trained
individuals was grappling
with the bank troubles
and the budget. The problem was first to close all
banks, and then to begin a
process of opening them in
a climate of safety.
Also, to cut federal
expenditures to the very
bone. With those purposes
Mr. Roosevelt was heartily
in sympathy. For at
that time he was a
prudent, economical, and
orthodox statesman.
The knowledge of what
might be done was with
the members of the Hoover
administration who
remained after the inauguration to help in a
common, non-partisan
cause. For the Hoover
administration knew what
should be done, but a
Democratic Congress had
for two years followed a
policy of political frustration.
The Roosevelt administration and the Congress
elected with it had the
mandate. Together, they
saw that what could be
done was done.
In dealing with the
banks, the Hoover appointees were former Treasury
Secretary Ogden L.
Mills and his undersecretary, Arthur A. Ballantine; F. G. Awalt, acting
comptroller of the currency, and Jesse H. Jones,
then a member and later
chairman of the RFC. The
Roosevelt appointees were
Treasury Secretary William Woodin and Budget
Director Lewis W. Douglas.
I served ex-officio as
Woodin's assistant, although my office was in
another department. The
banks were closed under
the authority of an old law
passed in 1917. The emergency legislation which
provided for their reopening was sent to Congress
even before it assembled
on March 9 and was
passed a few hours later.
The next day, March 10,
a message and bill went to
Congress cutting the
budget drastically. This
bill was passed on March
20.
The planning of those
moves was mostly in the
office of the Secretary of
the Treasury where, as I
wrote some years later,
"this group of men had
forgotten to be Republicans and Democrats. They
were just a bunch of men
trying to save the banking
system." All were conservative and orthodox. And
capitalism was saved in
eight days.
What came later is
another story. But the
country liked what happened, and confidence
turned the tide.
