Udall Power Play Is Protested by
Fellow Rider on the New Frontier
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Interior Secretary Ste-
wart L. Udall rivals the
late Secretary Ickes in his
zeal to impose upon the
nation a federal monopoly
in the production and
transmission of electric
power. This year he has
sponsored two policies
which, however, have
brought strong protests
from a fellow New Fron-
tiersman, Joseph C. Swid-
ler, chairman of the Fed-
eral Power Commission.
*
These differences do not
Indicate that Swidler is a
dedicated friend of the
privately owned power
companies. But it shows
that, in bearing his res-
ponsibility, he is becoming
more and more aware that
by monopolistic federal
activities the consuming
public becomes the victim
of higher costs and less
efficient service.
Arizona, through its
own power authority, has
developed plans to build a
dam on the Colorado River
at what is known as
Marble Canyon. This
would enable the state to
serve its rapidly growing
population with water and
electric power without fed-
eral interference or par-
ticipation.
Through the Arizona
Power Authority, the
state has made an applica-
tion to the FPC for a
license to build the dam.
From the statements of
Swidler and others, it has
appeared virtually certain
that the application would
be granted.
To prevent this, Sen.
Hayden, no doubt at the
insistance of Udall, intro-
duced a bill (S-502) to
forbid the FPC's granting
of any license for a dam on
the river from the Hoover
Dam to the Glen Canyon
Dam in Utah before 1969.
*
Clearly, this was a play
to take authority from the
FPC. This issue has raised
a great deal of controversy
in Arizona, with Gov.
Fannin, Sen. Goldwater,
and others favoring the
state, and Udall, Hayden,
and others against.
Another issue, which
affects practically all the
western states, was raised
by Udall in January. In
this he was joined by his
colleague, Secretary of
Agriculture Orville L.
Freeman. The depart-
ments headed by these
secretaries have custody
of substantially all federal
land. These holdings com-
prise a major part of the
area of the western third
of the United States.
The orders promulgated
by Udall and Freeman,
which would require no
legislation in Congress,
would place certain condi-
tions upon any grant of a
right of way over fed-
erally owned land to "pri-
vate or other non-federal
transmission lines."
*
Those conditions would
be these:
The United States
(meaning federal power
agencies) could use such
privately owned transmis-
sion lines, to whatever
degree there was excess
capacity, to transmit its
own power to its custom-
ers. The determination of
what would be "excess
capacity" would rest upon
the arbitrary de-
termination of the Interior
and Agriculture Depart-
ments.
The federal government
could, at its own expense,
"increase the capacity of
such lines" for use in
transmitting its own pow-
er.
Udall and Freeman or
their successors could re-
ject any application for
such rights-of-way if they
were in conflict with the
"power marketing pro-
gram of the United
States." In fact, the only
program which the "Unit-
ed States" has under this
administration is to invade
as much of the market
now supplied by private
companies as is possible.
Swidler's objections to
such regulations is a rea-
soned statement of the
responsibility of the fed-
eral government in the
electric power sector of
the economy. It is, he said,
of paramount importance
that the nation's resources
be used to the full in
serving the consuming
public. Such service to the
public should be encou-
raged by the FPC through
approving "voluntary in-
terconnection and co-or-
dination of facilities."
*
Swidler further said
that the Udall-Freeman
regulations would impede
the FPC in its efforts to
further its policies. He
said also that such regula-
tions would compel com-
panies building transmis-
sion lines to make expen-
sive detours to avoid pass-
ing over public lands and
thus increase the cost of
their power to the public.
In any event, Swidler
concludes, such joint use
of transmission lines
should be a function of the
FPC rather than the re-
sults of arbitrary regula-
tions of the Interior and
Agriculture Departments.
It is clear that Swid-
ler's objections in these
two instances point up the
fact that the development
of monopolistic practices
in the production and
transmission of federal
power is certainly not in
the interest of the consum-
ing public.
