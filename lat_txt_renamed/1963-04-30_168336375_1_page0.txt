Some Laments of the Intellectuals
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It happens that in the
past week or so I have been
reading two items which
not only supplement each
other but have contemporary
meaning since the
advent of the Kennedy
administration.
One is a most perceptive
address by Prof. George J.
Stigler, whose monumental
economic studies for
the National Institute of
Economic Research approach
the level of classics. His
address is entitled "The
Intellectuals and the Market
Place."
*
After reading the Stigler
paper, I reread F. Scott
Fitzgerald's "This Side of
Paradise." As those who
have read the 1920
Fitzgerald novel know, the
story is that of Amory
Blaine, whose horrible
bringing-up created a
completely confused
young man who veered
from one intellectual interest
to another.
In the process, he discovered
among his bookish acquaintances
a naive belief in socialism.
Perhaps if Fitzgerald had
written a sequel in the later
1930s, he would have found
that his young intellectuals
had found a sort of purpose
in life by joining in the
political ferment which
characterized the Roosevelt
era.
*
But he would have
found, as Stigler has pointed
out four decades later, that
intellectuals of that kind
have carried over into
their new life all the basic
prejudices against the way
our economic system operates.
Except that one can find
many individuals who call
themselves "intellectuals,"
there can be no very
precise definition of that
term. Its use in the current
sense, whatever that is, is
not more than 60 years old.
While the verbal root is
the same, the term "intellectual"
should not be confused with
intelligence. But there is one
characteristic which distinguishes
the intellectual, other than
his antipathy to free enterprise.
This is a feeling that he is
unfairly treated in a society
Moley
"which he had no part in
creating."
As Jacques Barzun points
out in his "House of Intellect,"
the intellectual seeks distinction
in his imaginary degradation in
the capitalistic atmosphere of
western civilization: "To the
beleaguered intellectual it is a
badge and distinction in life."
By their lamentations ye shall
know them.
Most of those who class
themselves as intellectuals
write or speak for a living.
They teach in institutions of
learning and they work for
newspapers and magazines.
Some, indeed, labor grudgingly
and with red faces in the
advertising business.
But as Stigler says, these
imaginary misfits proliferate
only in an economy made rich
by free enterprise. He points
out that when Plato set the
pattern there were probably
not more than 200 intellectuals
in Athens. In capitalistic America
there must be a million.
They are not badly treated
by the system which they
deplore. They live on the fat
of a capitalistic land. If they
choose teaching, businessmen
trustees give them something
called tenure.
The lot of professional
writers was never so good. If
they seek leisure to travel,
there are Ford Foundation
grants. If they want to vent
their woes in a novel, they
may apply for a Guggenheim
fellowship. And if they seek
release in far-away lands,
there is the Peace Corps.
Fulbright scholarships are
available to the more or less
bright.
*
Stigler notes that the two
major complaints of intellectuals
are, first, that the free enterprise
system has made no provision
for those whose talents are not
oriented to profit-making, and,
second, that the free market
has not decreased the disparity
between the rich and poor.
The first of these complaints
I have already answered.
The second is simply not true.
Stigler emphasizes what Von
Mises has pointed out repeatedly:
Only in the more industrialized
societies has the gap between
rich and poor been narrowed.
One needs only to look at Latin
America, Africa and Asia in contrast
to the United States to see that
this is true.
*
And as studies of the
National Institute of Economic
Research show, the redistribution
of wealth in America has been
accelerated in the past generation
more than in all the ages before.
But perhaps these realities
will escape the intellectuals for
a long time to come. Meanwhile,
they will deserve only that bit
of sympathy that the compassionate
bestow upon those who suffer
delusions.
