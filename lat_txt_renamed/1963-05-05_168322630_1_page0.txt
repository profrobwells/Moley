Two-Party System Is
Making Gains in Texas
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This is written after two
crossings on the highways
of Texas within the past
three weeks. The first was
over the northwest corner,
the second from El Paso to
the northeast corner.
In the course of those
travels, politically sophis-
ticated Texans convinced
me that the state is not
just trying to establish a
two-party system. It alrea-
dy has one.
A well-informed editor
said, "I have 'anticipated
for some years that Texas
would have a strong Re-
publican Party. But it has
come sooner than I expect-
ed. There is scarcely an
office of any importance in
the state for which it can
be assumed that a Demo-
crat is sure to be elected.
"For a time, the political
struggle was between the
conservative and liberal
wings of the Democratic
Party. Now conservatives,
especially the young
people, are turning to the
Republican Party."

While I was in Texas, a
newspaper story said that
a Republican had been
chosen mayor by the City
Council of Ft. Worth. This
event passed almost unno-
ticed. Ten years ago, it
would have attracted
much attention.
Two members of the
Texas delegation in the
House of Representatives
in Washington are Repub-
lican: Bruce Alger, who
already has veteran sta-
tus, and Ed Foreman of
Odessa, who was elected
last year. John Tower
represents Texas in the
Senate.
Democratic. Sen. Ralph
W. Yarborough, who must
run for re-election next
year, shows signs of panic.
He was elected by the
liberal wing of the Demo-
cratic Party in Texas at a
time when that group was
considerably stronger
than it is now.
While the Kennedy ad-
ministration finds kinship
with Yarborough's libera-
lism, it must be careful not
to offend Vice President
Lyndon Johnson who,
while he makes verbal
gestures toward all Demo-
crats, is more clearly iden-
tified with the conserva-
tive Democrats.
The new Texas gover-
nor, John B. Connally Jr.,
is moderately conserva-
tive. If Yarborough wins in
the primary against con-
servative opponents, many
may well turn to the Re-
publican candidate in the
election.
A long time ago, the
now 94-year-old and little
noted John Nance Garner
told me that there would
never be a Republican
Party in Texas until Re-
publicans began to cap-
ture county offices. There,
he said, is the solid core of
the Democratic Party in
Texas. But already the
Republican Party is mak-
ing gains in rural areas.
But the rural influence
is weakening. For 75% of
the population of Texas is
in urban areas. This com-
pares with 72% in Michi-
gan.
The balance of power is
already shifting to the
cities and their growing
suburbs. And there, in
every state-wide election,
Republicans either have a
majority or are nearing it.
In Houston I was told
that the greatest Republi-
can gains are among youn-
ger voters, Texas
students, ever since the
war, have been leaning to
conservatism. Now they
are turning to the Repub-
lican Party as the best
party alternative for con-
servatives.

The editor quoted above
said that this drift to
Republicanism has little to
do with the integration-
segregation issue. For
Texas has been a leader
among Southern states in
accepting the fact of inte-
gration. Schools are admit-
ting qualified Negroes.
Public facilities, except in
certain counties, are open
to both races.
In short, the racial issue
has little or nothing to do
with political trends.
