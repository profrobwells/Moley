The Big City Puts a Tax on Beauty
A case has appeared in
the courts of New York
which shows clearly one of
the most important rea-
sons why our great Ameri-
can cities are dying at the
centers and why, beyond
their downtown areas,
they have sprawled out
into ugly, uneconomical
congeries of gaping va-
cancies and hit-or-miss de-
velopments.
In New York City the
most interesting street is
that part of Park Ave.
from a sightly church at
60th St. down to a new
Tower of Babel. This hor-
ror on the horizon is the
Pan-Am Building, which
rises above the rear
haunches of what was
once the symmetrical
Grand Central Station.
In that stretch of the
avenue, there are three
hotels, a club, and a
beautiful church. The rest

with low intensity light
glowing from all sides. It
has received many awards
and citations.
The government of the
City of New York has
pounced upon this struc-
ture with an assessment
which means that builders
from here on must, if they
are to enjoy the lightest
tax burden, sacrifice every
Moley
are towering office buil- consideration of public en-
dings.
Most of the builders of
those office structures
have sought the maximum
rental income and the
lowest taxes by crowding
their buildings against the
sidewalk and elevating
them as high as the law
allows. A few have offered
those who pass by a bit of
ocular refreshment by ex-
cluding commerce from
the ground floor, using
that space for small plazas.
*
But outstanding on the
avenue, and indeed in the
nation, is the Seagram
Building, a 38-story bronze
and glass structure set
back to accommodate a
plaza 100 ft. deep where
there are fountains and
trees. At night the Sea-
gram structure is a tower
joyment and beauty by
utilizing every inch of
land for greater rental
space above.
¥
In six years the assess-
ment of the land which
the building and plaza
occupy has risen 31.5%.
and on comparable land
across the avenue the
assessment has gone up
only 5%. In determining
the value of the Seagram
structure for tax purposes,
the city used the cost of
reproduction as a meas-
ure, instead of the capital-
ized amount of the net
rental income as in other,
box-like buildings.
Thus, the Seagram tax
assessment per square foot
of rentable floor space is
$33.98, but for a nearby
building on the avenue it
is $17.74. The annual addi-
tional tax burden is $383,-
000.
When Seagram carried
their case to the interme-
diate court, the Appellate
Division, the city's assess-
ment was sustained, and
most bizarre reasoning
was offered in justification
for the decision. The court
said that the method of
using reproduction cost in
this instance, rather than
the capitalized net rental
income, was justified be-
cause the unique charac-
ter and beauty of the
structure provided "pres-
tige" of commercial value
to the company.

This means that the city
and the court abandoned
mathematical calculations
and flew into the misty
realm of psychology. Thus,
a man who makes himself
attractive and presentable
in his business life by
wearing good clothes
should be fined while his
seedy competitor is re-
warded.
A great but sadly ne-
glected economic philoso-
pher, Henry George,
wrote 80 years ago, "If I
have worked harder and
built myself a good house
while you have been con-
tented to live in a hovel,
the tax gatherer now
comes annually to make
me pay a penalty for my
energy and industry.. If
a railroad be opened,
down comes the tax collec-
tor on it as if it were a
public nuisance."

I might add that in the
past few years those in
New York who have main-
tained slums upon their
land have made fortunes
through urban renewal.
Everybody's taxes enrich
them, while those who
have built and improved
the city have taken all the
risks.
