The Water Issue Still
Plagues Southwest U.S.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the course of my
many visits in Arizona
and Southern California I
have never seen a gallon
of water wasted without
wondering about the fu-
ture of the multitudes who
are moving to that region.
There is unlimited space
for millions there.
And even without the
defense industries those
states can generate their
own economic life. The
climate and the natural
beauties of that area are
unsurpassed.
But there is not an
adequate supply of water.
That's the rub.

I once asked a high
official of the Los Angeles
Metropolitan Water Dis-
trict what will happen
when water needs reach
the distress level. He re-
plied that sooner or later
those states will realize
that water is too valuable
a resource to be used in
raising crops. Priorities
will be essential unless
some Moses waves a staff
which will eliminate salt
from the limitless waters
of the sea.
The concept of priorities
in the use of water is not
new. Four thousand years
ago, Hammurabi, king of
Babylonia, faced the same
problem that haunts our
Southwest — many people
and limited water. And so
the king in his famous
laws decreed that men
and beasts should have
first claim, households
next, and then land and
navigation.
The use of water for
growing crops is very
costly in water and mon-
ey. Some years ago, a
professor in Arizona esti-
mated that if one-tenth of
the irrigated land in cen-
tral Arizona were denied
water, there would be
enough to supply a city
twice the size of Phoenix.

On June 3 the U.S.
Supreme Court finally de-
cided a controversy be-
tween California and Ari-
zona which originated in
1952. This ruling allocates
the shares of California,
Arizona, and Nevada —
the "lower basin states" —
giving 4,400,000 acre feet
yearly to California, 2,800,-
000 to Arizona, and 300,-
000 to Nevada.
This is on the assump-
tion that after the upper
basin states have had their
share there will still be
7,500,000 acre feet and
enough left to give Mexico
the amount it is guaran-
teed under a treaty.
That involves a big "if."
For it is now demonstrat-
ed that the annual flow of
the Colorado River is
substantially less than was
estimated when the Colo-
rado River pact was
adopted in the 1920's.
There are also loud and
legitimate complaints
from Mexico that the
water received under its
treaty rights is so loaded
with minerals that it kills
the crops.
Despite the freedom ex-
ercised by the Supreme
Court in making new laws
where none existed
before, its power falls
short of creating water
that isn't there. Both Cali-
fornia and Arizona will
have to depend upon pre-
sent sources.
Los Angeles has the
Owens River supply and
what it can get from the
Colorado. It also must
draw heavily upon under-
ground supplies despite a
falling water table.
Arizona also is fearful
because of a diminishing
underground supply. Be-
yond that, it taps a few
rivers such as the Salt.
California has author-
ized the Feather River
project. This would, when
completed, bring water
from that river down
through the Central Val-
ley to Southern California.
But political pressures are
very great to divert a good
deal of that supply for
many irrigation projects
before it reaches the fast-
growing populations in
the south.
Moreover, there is alrea-
dy serious concern about
the tax burdens which
will be involved. And past
experience teaches that
the ultimate cost of the
project will run far be-
yond the bond issue alrea-
dy authorized.
*
Even with all these
devices, the tremendous
human migration to
Southern California and
Arizona will continue to
raise critical problems of
water supply.
Finally, there is the
hope that current exper-
iments may make it possi-
ble to convert sea water.
But that deliverance may
not come for an indetermi-
nate number of years.
