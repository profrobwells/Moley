Court Ruling Aids GOP in South
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The rule is that a bad
tree cannot bring forth
good fruit. But one excep-
tion is being joyfully
hailed by conservative Re-
publicans in the South and
in Washington.
The Supreme Court, in
March, 1962, in the case of
Baker vs. Carr, held that
the courts may take juris-
diction in cases in which
citizens of a state claim
that the districts drawn by
the state legislature give
inequitable representation
to centers with large pop-
ulations. This judgment
was based upon the "equal
protection" clause in the
14th Amendment.

Liberal Democrats
danced in the streets. At
last, they said, democracy
has triumphed. No longer
could conservative rural
clodhoppers frustrate
liberal majorities in urban
centers.
Justice Frankfurter, in
his last and finest opinion,
dissented. He said, in
effect, that the court
usurped authority which
properly rested in the
legislatures of the states.
Apportionment was a poli-
tical, not a judicial respon-
sibility. "There is not a
judicial remedy for every
political mischief. The fra-
mers (of the Constitution)
carefully and with de-
liberate forethought re-
fused so to enthrone the
Judiciary."
★
Frankfurter further
pointed out the practical
difficulties if judges tried
to draw guide lines. Their
training did not fit them
for such an exercise. Fin-
ally, he said that represen-
tation based on population
"has never been generally
practiced. It is not the
system chosen for the
national government by
the Constitution, it was
not the system exclusively
or even predominantly
practiced by the states at
the time of the adoption of
the 14th Amendment."
The results over the
year following Baker vs.
Carr have measurably jus-
tified Frankfurter's opi-
nion, Court dockets, alrea-
Frankfurter
dy over-burdened, have
had to find room for many
suits, few of which have
any merit, even when
considered in the light of
the "democratic" principle
involved. Most of these
suits are either pending or
have been appealed. The
Supreme Court docket is
crowded with seven ap-
peals from lower courts.
*
In six states which have
redistricted—Wyoming,
Iowa, Colorado, Maryland,
Utah, and West Virginia—
the change made has, so
far as population repre-
sentation is concerned, af-
fected only one house.
This plan is called the
"little federal plan"—one
house based on areas, the
other on population, like
the U.S. Senate and
House.
Where the change was
made by a popular vote,
the results showed that
voters rejected the "liber-
al" plan on "one man, one
vote."
In Nebraska the late
Sen. George Norris some
years ago brought about a
"modern" system of one
house based on population.
But in a statewide vote
the Norris plan was reject-
ed and an area system
won.
★
In Georgia, Republicans
are rejoicing because the
courts struck down the
"county unit system."
This will, if finally upheld
by the Supreme Court,
most probably permit At-
lanta and other major
cities to dominate state
elections. Since those
cities are Republican, this
will establish a real two-
party system in a state
where the Democratic
Party has been most solid.
If this drift prevails,
the whole South can no
longer be written off as
solidly Democratic.
★
When the "liberals" re-
joiced over Baker vs. Carr,
they failed to realize that,
while Northern cities are
mostly Democratic, the
major cities in the South
turned in Republican ma-
jorities in 1960 and 1962.
And Southern Republi-
cans are conservative in
their opposition to more
federal centralization and
government control of
state economic and politi-
cal affairs. So far as the
racial issue is concerned in
those states it is not a
party issue.
And so a decision forced
by "liberal" members of
the Supreme Court has
backfired. It has given
new life to the Republican
Party.
