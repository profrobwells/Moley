The Urban Muddle of Washington
There is mounting
evidence that the govern-
ment of the District of
Columbia ranks high
among the worst-managed
urban areas in the United
States. There is a frighten-
ing amount of delinquen-
cy, a mass-transit muddle
that has prevailed for
years, intolerable traffic
conditions, and incredible
waste and mismanage-
ment in the administra-
tion of welfare programs.
This big and growing
community, it should be
noted, is the responsibility
of the President and Con-
gress of the United States.
In beautifying it, Pres-
idents and Congresses
have spent sums which
dwarf the efforts of Na-
poleon III in rebuilding
Paris or those expended
by the Caesars in making
splendid the eternal city of
.Rome.
Bills are introduced eve-
ry year in great profusion
to make Washington a
center of culture. The
Kennedy regime struggles
to cultivate the arts. The
population, with notable
exceptions, stands high in
intelligence.

But incompetence in the
city hall mocks all these
exterior advantages. The
President appoints the
commission that runs the
district, and committees of
Congress are supposed to
supervise and direct it.
But this President and
this Congress essay the
responsibility of telling all
the cities of the nation as
well as the states and
territories how they
should govern themselves,
of minding everybody's
business, of making deci-
sions for private corpora-
tions, and, indeed, of tak-
ing over, owning, and
operating much of what is
now individual enterprise.
There is much energy
spent in lecturing friendly
foreign nations, helping to
set up governments in
countries which have no
competence to govern
themselves, delivering in-
sulting lectures to Eu-
ropean countries about
their colonial operations,

and generally ordering
matters all over the earth
and in the heavens above
it.
The latest commentary
upon the incompetence of
the District government
was submitted to Congress
on July 8 by the Comptrol-
ler General of the United
States. It concerns a mat-
ter which the President
has made a cardinal part
of his program of reform:
medical care to the aged.
It has been the Kennedy
contention since the cam-
paign of 1960 that the old
people of the nation must
not wither away and rot
with disease because of
the inadequacy of existing
methods of medical assis-
tance and that the federal
government should take
over their care.
It has also been clear
that there is no disposition
on the part of the Kenne-
dy administration to en-
courage the states and
dependencies, including
the District of Columbia,
to avail themselves effec-
tively of the provisions of
the Kerr-Mills bill which
was enacted into law in
1960.
For the successful oper-
ation of the Kerr-Mills
legislation would make
the enactment of the Ken-
nedy plan for medical aid
to the aged unnecessary.
The stated purpose of
the 1960 legislation is
through federal grants of
money to encourage the
states and dependencies,
including the district, to
provide programs of medi-
cal assistance to low-in-
come, aged persons who
have not the means to
provide such medical care
for themselves.
The Kerr-Mills plan per-
mits the Secretary of
Health, Education and
Welfare to determine the
federal share of expense
for such programs. And so
the HEW secretary has
fixed that amount of fe-
deral help for the District
of Columbia at 50%.
The report of the Comp-
troller General says that
"at the time the (Kerr-
Mills) legislation was
enacted, low-income aged
residents of the district
were already being pro-
vided the type of basic
care and services contem-
plated under the medical
care for the aged program.
"However, to become eli-
gible for the federal
grants, the district needed
to obtain legislative au-
thority to change certain
of its residency require-
ments. We found that the
district delayed seeking
the necessary legislative
authority and did not
adequately prepare for
participation in the pro-
gram."
*
Thus it did not receive
the federal assistance to
which it was entitled.
The Comptroller Gener-
al goes on in his report to
say that this failure to
implement the Kerr-Mills
program is only "a symp-
tom" of more extensive
weaknesses in the district
programs which his office
has brought to the atten-
tion of Congress from time
to time in the past.
Three conclusions are
inevitable. First, that Con-
gress and its subcom-
mittees failed to take ac-
tion on reports of district
incompetence. Second,
that the district author-
ities were apparently un-
willing to make the Kerr-
Mills plan a success.
And, finally, that even
when it might get money
from prompt action, the
district neglected its re-
sponsibility.
