Property Tax Inequities Hurt Us
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In one of his debates
with Richard Nixon in
1960 John F. Kennedy
said that the property tax
was practically exhausted
as a source of revenue. On
this assumption he advo-
cated vast new federal
expenditures for local faci-
lities... such as public
schools.
It is a pity that Nixon did
not remind his opponent
that it was the federal
income tax, not the
property tax, which had
reached the point of dimi-
nishing returns. Mr. Ken-
nedy has admitted that in
asking for tax rate reduc-
tions this year.
The soundest of all
principles of taxation, ex-
pounded ever since Adam
Smith, is that a tax should
bear as lightly as possible
on the sources of produc-
tion.
From this, the inference
can be drawn that the best
and most equitable tax is
one which bears heavily
upon unearned wealth.
Let us bring this principle
home to our great urban
centers, which are de-
manding so many federal
handouts for local im-
provements.
Those cities and their
suburbs have not grown
efficiently and attractive-
ly. They have sprawled
over great areas, with
much of the land therein
either vacant or occupied
only by obsolete buildings.
A major reason for this
is inequity in taxation.
Property taxes almost
universally are levied
upon both buildings and
the land under the build-
ings. Generally the land is
under-assessed and new
improvements are over-
assessed for tax purposes.
This enables holders of
unused land and slum
property to reap profits as
the communities grow ar-
ound them. Show me a
vacant piece of land or a
slum and I will show you
that the owner is speculat-
ing on getting a large
profit when he sells, an
unearned profit.
Most of the great Ameri-
can fortunes in the past
and to a degree in the
present have been made
by holders of land. They
have not improved the
community. They have
profited by the growth of
large populations in their
areas.
To cure this inequity
and to raise more money
for local services such as
schools, hospitals and
streets, and also to stimu-
late private housing, two
factors should be consi-
dered. The state and local
laws should differentiate
between the tax on land
and the tax on improve-
ments.
Also, in the assessing of
property, a heavier bur-
den should rest upon land
and lighter burdens should
be placed upon improve-
ments.
Since the more imme-
diate method of reform is
in assessments, a very
comprehensive study is
about to be issued on the
subject, by the Advisory
Commission on Inter-
governmental Relations.
This commission was
created by an act of
Congress and is composed
of governors, members of
Congress and mayors. It
has a very large and
comp√©tent research staff.
Its chief concerns are
those areas of government
in which local commu-
nities, states and the fe-
deral government all have
interests at the present
time.
And its aim is to see
how far the states and
local governments can car-
ry the responsibilities
which properly belong to
them.
The new study is on the
reform of the property
tax. The commission's re-
port points out that the
amount raised now from
the property tax is more
than $20 billion. The as-
sessed value of property
subject to the tax, deter-
mined by assessors
throughout the country, is
more than $350 billion.
But this represents a
market value of three
times that amount, or
more than $1 trillion.
With this vast wealth
now under-assessed and
inequitably taxed, the
commission regards re-
form in assessments as a
major step toward shifting
responsibility back to the
states and local commu-
nities.
At the present time the
business of assessments is
probably the most unsatis-
factory of all government
operations. Assessors are
in large part elective.
Assessments are ridden
with favoritism, special
considerations which are
not relevant to raising
revenue, and the lack of
training and the incompe-
tence of assessors.
A major need is to
establish assessment ma-
chinery by state law so
that assessors will be
trained, professional
people removed as far as
possible from local politi-
cal or economic interests.
It is hoped that by such
reforms it may be possible
to check the growth of
federal control of local
affairs,
