Basic Misunderstandings by U.S.
Aid Communism in Latin America
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Not long ago a former
member of the Roosevelt
administration, who has
lived several years since
then in Latin America,
was asked about the var-
ious military take-overs in
some of the nations down
there.
In reply, he pointed out
that, contrary to an opi-
nion quite common in the
United States, these ac-
tions of the military were
absolutely necessary to
the maintenance of stable
government, public wel-
fare, and order.
The higher ranks in the
military establishments in
those countries have been
recruited from the more
enlightened families. They
are for the most part
essentially patriotic indivi-
duals who do not seek
power for power's sake,
but seek to prevent dema-
goguery, chaos, and the
spread of communism.
This informed opinion,
it should be noted, comes
from a man who was
frequently under attack
here for his left-wing
views. But personal con-
tacts with the realities of
so-called democracy in
semi-developed countries
have modified his views.
Three major errors by
the government of the
United States have not
only increased the danger
of Communist control in
Latin America but have
substantially encouraged
military leaders to protect
themselves against com-
munism.
*
The first of these errors
was the abrogation of the
Platt Amendment by the
Roosevelt administration.
This was done because it
was assumed that the rule
of Batista would make it
unnecessary for the Unit-
ed States to intervene in
Cuba. This proved to be a
very foolish estimate of
what might happen after
Batista.
Next, during the Eisen-
hower administration,
Castro was helped to gain
power because of the blun-
ders of subordinates in the
State Department. Despite
the protest of two of
Eisenhower's ambassa-
dors to Cuba, to the
"fourth floor" in the State
Department Castro was a
benign reformer. Now we
know that this was a
tragedy like the misjudg-
ment of Mao Tse-tung.
Third and finally, the
Kennedy administration,
by its misjudgment not
only of Castro but of the
designs of the Soviet
government, has abrogat-
ed the Monroe Doctrine
after nearly a century and
a half.
What has been the ef-
fect of these successive
exhibitions of American
weakness and miscalcula-
tion?
They have encouraged
Communists to believe
that Latin-American
countries are fair game for
their designs. They are at
liberty to regard the Unit-
ed States not as a paper
tiger but as a Ferdinand
the Bull, with power but
with no disposition to use
it.
They have served notice
on the substantial people
in those countries that if
they are to be saved they
must do it themselves.
Hence, a disbelief in our
understanding and capaci-
ty for action has not only
created the chaos and
corruption of allegedly
popular governments, but
has aroused the military
to take things into their
own hands.
The naivete which per-
mitted the past mistakes
still seems to possess
official Washington and
commentators. These peo-
ple consistently speak
of military take-overs as
the overthrow of "democ-
racies." If they used the
word democracy as a
synonym of republican
government, they would
still be wrong. For while
the constitutions of most
Latin-American nations
are modeled on ours, with
the executive and legisla-
tive branches co-ordinated
and balanced one against
the other, these limita-
tions are scarcely ever
observed in practice.
*
What prevails in Latin
America is executive dic-
tatorship, either under a
socialist or Communist-
tinged president or under
a military chief. Consider-
ing the origins of these
two types, the military
seems to be less suscepti-
ble to Communist in-
fluence. And our lavish
outlays of money have
little effect upon the crea-
tion of stable govern-
ments.
