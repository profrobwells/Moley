Growing Conjecture
About Nixon Candidacy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those commentators
and reporters in the press
and over the airwaves
who have been giving so
much attention to the
possible emergence of
Richard M. Nixon as a
Presidential candidate
should become aware of
certain realities which
make any such develop-
ment wholly improbable,
if not impossible.
Some of the realities
become apparent after a
mere application of com-
mon sense to the situation
before the Republican
Party and Nixon himself.
Some are clear after a
little investigation. In
brief, those realities are:
★
Much of the talk of
Nixon as a candidate has
been planted deliberately.
In general, it has been
done to injure or impair
the chances for a Goldwa-
ter nomination. Such talk
is projected not because
some people love Nixon
more but because they
love Goldwater less.
As Nixon himself said in
an interview in Paris
during his recent business
trip there: "Anyone who
wants to run against John
F. Kennedy would have a
hole in his head if he
didn't start now to build
up a staff, especially a
research staff."
Nixon has no such staff.
He has only two young
women secretaries who
handle his mail and mat-
ters connected with his
law business.
The time has passed
when a candidate nomin-
ated by a convention
could, like William Jen-
nings Bryan, take to the
hustings with only an
alpaca coat or a Prince
Albert to be worn accord-
ing to the weather, and a
sort of press secretary and
general factotum to ac-
company him.
A candidate, from the
time he first decides to
make a contest for the
nomination, must now
have a staff of political
managers and a number of
specialists who can pro-
vide the materials for
speeches and statements.
Rockefeller has had such a
staff ever since he ran for
governor in 1958. Goldwa-
ter is assembling one now.
When we contemplate
nomination of Nixon at
the convention as a com-
promise, certain hard facts
emerge. Such a nomina-
tion would come only after
a terrific battle with the
numerous and enthusias-
tic Goldwater supporters.
Nixon, if nominated,
would not only have to
fight the powerful Kenne-
dy machine but labor to
unify his party. A devas-
tating defeat would cer-
tainly follow such a cam-
paign.
There is no important
demand among organiza-
tion Republican profes-
sionals for a Nixon nomin-
ation. He is well liked and
respected. But those rea-
lists believe that 1964 is
not Nixon's year.
Moreover, after long
consideration, Nixon
moved from California and
entered upon the serious
practice of law. The firm
which he joined is no
courthouse affair with one
foot in politics and another
in the courtroom. It is a
firm with very large cor-
porations as clients, with
interests in the United
States and abroad.
★
The fact that Nixon has
recently expressed his
views on national affairs is
based upon a very human
quality. A Republican
with his experience, his
past public service, and
his status in the party has
an obligation to make his
views known.
A man of his eminence
simply cannot vanish from
sight. And these expres-
sions of his views can be of
great value to his party
and the country. But if
every time he says some-
thing in public there will
be raised the question of
his possible candidacy, his
influence will be complete-
ly destroyed.
