Khrushchev May Have
to Turn to the West
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems to this observer
that everybody is specu-
lating but nobody knows
anything about the long-
term objectives of Soviet
Russian leaders.
The seers and crystal
gazers in our State De-
partment veer every week
from happy expectations
to black despair. Russian
experts on all sides flood
the market with books and
articles. And our govern-
ment skips from crisis to
crisis.
Since speculation is the
habit of the day, I venture,
as a non-expert on Rus-
sia and communism who
knows a bit of history and
something of the mentali-
ty of politicians, to offer a
personal hypothesis.
The Soviet has now
celebrated the 46th an-
niversary of the great
Bolshevik takeover. Once
more this was done with
tall talk of world-wide
worker and peasant re-
volt, along with great
flexing of military muscle
and threats to unbelievers
who still cling to capita-
lism.
For the light that flared
in Moscow in 1917 was
expected to enlighten the
world. Everywhere, ac-
cording to the Marxian
gospel, the middle class
was to be liquidated and
after a brief proletarian
dictatorship the national
state with its government
would wither away.
Some such happy dream
was essential to inspire
the Russian people and to
assure the support of the
politicians and ideologists
who had, perhaps to their
surprise, moved into the
vacuum created by imper-
ial collapse in war.
But always there was
the lure of the expansion
of the system over the
world. Always, there must
be the prospect of happy
days to come, when the
motherland of commu-
nism might fatten from
the countries that would
join the cult.
It has been thus with
every great movement in
the past.
The French revolution-
ists had hardly finished
cutting off the heads of
members of the old regime
before they began the
conquest of Europe. And
Americans must realize
that their own forebears,
having established repub-
lican institutions at home,
conceived of establishing
similar institutions every-
where. Liberty, their con-
cept of liberty, should
enlighten the world.
But in all such instances
the crusade slowed up as
the miles from the center
multiplied. In the far-off
reaches, doctrines, despite
virile evangelism, either
have been rejected or
have taken new forms
according to native tradi-
tions and circumstances.
This pattern has been
followed in the world
Communist movement.
The forms of commu-
nism which have deve-
loped in the far reaches of
Soviet influence are
strange. Remote control
cannot direct affairs ac-
cording to plans made in
Moscow. It is even possible
that the Kremlin is fearful
of the flaming revolts it
has ignited.
Perhaps — and this is
pure speculation —
Khrushchev, despite his
boasts and his threats and
his vacillation, has come to
realize that he needs the
West more than he needs
remote quasi-Communist
states.
As a realist, he must
know that the idea of
world-wide communism
was "of such stuff as
dreams are made on." It is
a movement that has gone
out of hand. And any
politician knows that such
a situation is dangerous
even to the people who
have projected it.
