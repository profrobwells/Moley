Dallas Police Failure
Recalls Early Lesson
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The instinct to right
wrongs by personal or
collective action is deeply
seated in human nature. It
is vastly older than the
growth of law and order
and the due process of
law.
The means that civiliza-
tion has created to see that
law shall prevail and that
private vengeance shall be
restrained and prevented
is a system of police,
prosecution, and the
courts.
I learned this many
years ago in a very vivid
manner. On Sept. 6, 1901, I
was a boy 15 years old
visiting, with my mother
and sister, the Pan Ameri-
can Exposition in Buffalo.
We were in one of the
buildings that day viewing
the exhibits. Next door
was the Temple of Music,
where President McKin-
ley was holding a recep-
tion.
The horrible words,
"McKinley was shot,"
came to us. I left my
companions and ran over
to the Temple of Music,
where a small crowd was
standing near a back en-
trance to the building.
McKinley had been re-
moved from another exit,
but this crowd was antici-
pating the appearance of
the assassin, Leon Czol-
gosz. A carriage drawn by
two horses was waiting
between the crowd and
the building. Then the
door opened, and we saw
Czolgosz brought out by
two guards holding him on
each side.
Someone shouted,
"Hang him!" and instinc-
tively the crowd moved to
carry out that purpose.
The guards acted with
incredible speed and
threw the assassin into the
carriage.
The driver started in
one direction, and the
crowd rushed for the car-
riage. But the driver
adroitly swung the carriage
around "on a dime" and
galloped away to the jail.
There was a trial. Czol-
gosz was revealed to be an
anarchist. He was duly
convicted and executed.
This lesson was embed-
ded in my mind 31 years
later in Miami, when
Guseppe Zangara, crazed
by pain from ulcerous
adhesions in his stomach,
bought a cheap revolver
and fired at President-
elect Roosevelt, fatally
wounding Mayor Cermak
of Chicago.
That night, as a member
of Roosevelt's party, I
returned with him and
some friends of Vincent
Astor to the yacht on
which the President-elect
had returned from a vaca-
tion.
Still with the lesson
learned 31 years before on
my mind, I asked Judge
Frederic Kernochan, a
member of the party, to
accompany me to the jail
to interview Zangara.
I told the judge that I
had two purposes in mind:
One, to see whether the
police had adequate
protection against a venge-
ful killing of the would-
be assassin; the other, to
determine whether the
man's motivation was in
any way ideological or
political.
Both questions were sa-
tisfied by our examination
of the prisoner. He was
safely protected pending
arraignment and trial.
And also he was complete-
ly without any political
motivation. He was simply
crazed with pain. He hat-
ed, he said, "all big men."
This 62-year-old lesson
came to me when I heard
of the shooting in Dallas.
So far as the character
and associations of Oswald
were concerned this ques-
tion was fairly well esta-
blished. Up to a point, the
Dallas police did a fairly
good job, although there
was too much talking by
the chief of police about
the evidence.
But for the carelessness
in handling Oswald there
can be no excuse.
