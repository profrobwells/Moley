There Is No Collective
Guilt in Kennedy Death
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Now that the public
mind has calmed down
after a confusion of
tongues after the deplora-
ble death of President
Kennedy, it is time to
consider the reality.
The guilt, so far as we
know, was not collective
or the result of a conspira-
cy. It is a case of police
efficiency, of security by
those responsible for the
safety of the President,
and of new measures that
can be taken to prevent
any similar tragedy in the
future.
*
Wisely, the new Pres-
ident ordered the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to
gather all the facts. The
state of Texas is investi-
gating. And to prevent
congressional committees
from running off in all
directions, the President
has created a commission
to assess the facts and
make a report.
As Charles Evans
Hughes once said, "Guilt
is personal." Whether
there was a conspiracy of
which the assassin was
the instrument is a matter
for determination.
The question of security
goes beyond the protection
of the President and other
public officials. It also
concerns the presence in
our midst of dangerous
characters who are dedi-
cated enemies of public
order and of our institu-
tions. Our population
also has within it a gene-
rous number of demented
individuals, dope addicts
and criminally inclined
who are completely non-
political but dangerous.
Identification, surveil-
lance, and control of these
is the job of public authori-
ty. But many people who
should know better have
taken this matter into
their own hands, or, shall I
say, their own mouths.
Among these are indivi-
duals who believe in col-
lective guilt. We have
been told that Dallas, or
Texas, or the United
States, or "all of us" are
guilty. Some have rushed
into print, or over the air
waves, even onto pulpits.
This has been an evidence
of dangerous irresponsibi-
lity. It could have been
foreseen because it has
followed other such trag-
edies in the past.
The Voice of America
rushed into its world-wide
broadcasts, minutes after
the criminal act, the alle-
gation that Dallas has
been the center of "the
extreme right wing." This
was deleted in later broad-
casts, but it gave the
Kremlin something to use
against the United States.
An attack on Dallas and
the right wing has been
implicit in excited voices
even after the identity of
the assassin was measura-
bly established.

To equate political dis-
sent with hate and vi-
olence is to strike at an
American principle which
requires constant debate
on national policies, no
matter who is in public
office.
Such collective indict-
ments are in themselves a
form of mob violence.
They do not destroy hate.
They are the very seeds of
hate.
