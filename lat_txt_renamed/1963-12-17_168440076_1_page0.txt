Is a Tax Cut the Cure
for Unemployment?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Aside from dedicated
Democrats who will hail
any President of their
party, many people will
reserve judgment on Mr.
Johnson for some time.
They will seek to determine
whether the new
President is a very astute
individual who can endorse
the liberal policies
he inherited and also
move toward a more
moderate attitude in economic
affairs.
For, although in Texas
he supported the conservative
wing of his party,
his voting record in Congress
followed a consistent
liberal philosophy.
Thus, he supports a tax
cut to eradicate unemployment
and calls for 75
million jobs. But various
issues are raised by an
assumption that a tax cut
will greatly affect unemployment.
One is the nature of the
tax cut which will ultimately
be passed by Congress.
If it gives the
greater relief to those who
will acquire more venture
capital, it will be likely to
produce new industry and
new jobs. But if, as is
more likely, the bulk of
the windfall goes to those
with low incomes, the
effect on unemployment
will be negative.
For those millions who
would save a few dollars
in taxes will more likely
merely stimulate the purchase,
on time, of more
consumer goods. It is true
that some will add to their
savings or buy stock or
pay debts. But this is only
in part real investment.
Will it appreciably create
new employment?
Jobs can be created by
the investment of savings.
But real savings must be
distinguished from financial
transactions that appear
to add to accumulated
savings.
For example, as a home
buyer pays off the principal
of his mortgage, he is
said to be adding to his
equity—increasing his
real ownership of the
house. But it is a mistake
to consider this as savings
he can spend. The capital
is frozen.
The man who buys 100
shares of General Motors,
DuPont or IBM is, of
course, an investor. But
the funds he commits to
such well-established and
proven business enterprises
are not venture capital
in a strict sense.
Venture capital is money
put to far greater risk.
It is capital applied to the
building of new organizations,
the development of
untried products, and the
exploration of unknown
markets.
Job creation depends on
the risk investment of real
savings. For it is only the
successful venture into
new areas—undertaken at
considerable risk of failure
and loss—which can and
will provide the jobs that
will take men off the
unemployment rolls.
Today there is an over-
abundance of investors
who will compete for the
opportunity to put their
money into blue-chip corporations.
The real need is
for those who will put risk
capital into untried situations.
Government economists
will provide fancy figures
for the President when he
enters his campaign for
election in 1964. There
may be means of documenting
the illusion of a
spirit of good business in
the second half of next
year. But such an illusion
is created by any wide
distribution of new money.
In 1936 a soldiers’ bonus
created such an illusion,
which carried President
Roosevelt to a great
triumph at the polls. But
beginning in 1937 the shot
in the economic arm wore
off.
Lyndon B. Johnson is a
very plausible man. But
we shall be wise if we
consider not only the
short term results of his
policies, but their ultimate
consequences.
