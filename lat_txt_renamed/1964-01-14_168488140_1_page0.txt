Television to Date Is
a Huge Political Flop
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is about time for the
television industry to live
up to its loud claims that it
is a great boon to political
life. So far, it has demon-
strated gross ineptitude,
amateurishness, and not a
little prejudice.
A few examples will
illustrate this abysmal fail-
ure of a new medium to
live up to its billing.
On Sunday, Jan. 5, Bar-
ry Goldwater was inter-
viewed on "Meet the
Press." The Arizona sena-
tor had just announced his
candidacy for the Pres-
idential nomination.
This announcement had
been widely anticipated
for several days in the
press. And so on this
nationally televised half-
hour millions were expect-
ed to tune in to see the
candidate and hear the
first public statements in a
campaign which will occu-
py the stage for months to
come.

The master of the show
and principal interlocutor,
Lawrence Spivak, and
Ned Brooks, the modera-
tor, are able and respected
journalists. Spivak's ques-
tions are always carefully
considered and highly per-
tinent. Brooks presides
with grace and intel-
ligence. They know their
politics.
But the three additional
reporters selected to ques-
tion the senator were
relatively unknown and, if
we may judge from their
performance on this occa-
sion, possessed of about
enough political wisdom to
serve as precinct commit-
teemen.
I could name 25 journa-
lists of high repute and
experience who could
have made the affair a
really distinguished pre-
sentation of vital issues.
The purpose of the pro-
gram, unless I wholly
misunderstand it, was to
make Goldwater's views
better known and under-
stood. The result could not
have been satisfactory
either to Goldwater's
friends or opponents.
I grant that the senator
himself failed to avail
himself of this opportunity
to project his ideas to
millions. The question I
am raising is the failure of
the managers of the show.
This is not the first time
that television has made a
mess of a political pro-
gram or occasion.
Nearly 12 years ago,
Gen. Eisenhower's accep-
tance speech in Abilene,
Kan., was televised. It was
a sorry performance. It
was staged out of doors.
There was some rain, and
the pages of the general's
speech fluttered in the
wind.
Behind the speaker ap-
peared acres of parked
cars, with people moving
about among them. Dan
Thornton stood at the
speaker's side with a big
Texas hat, bellowing in
the loudest hog-calling
manner.
In that campaign and in
1956 viewers saw a tired,
listless Adlai Stevenson
reading half-hour
speeches. These won no
votes, but the networks
won fat fees for the time
consumed.
But the crowning exam-
ple of TV incompetence
was in the staging of the
Kennedy-Nixon debates in
1960. The stage looked like
that of a summer theater
in the hayloft of a barn.
The two debaters were
awkwardly placed, stand-
ing behind rickety po-
diums.

Finally, there was the
dreadful computer show
on election night, 1960.
Before thousands of
people in the West had
voted, these brainless,
faceless machines were
spewing out "odds" on
Kennedy of 333-1, al-
though the final result
was razor thin and was
not known for 16 hours.
So far, television has
been the most unfortunate
addition to our political
life since free government
was born. And judging
from the 1964 beginning, it
will be little better this
time.
