The great exposure by
the communications in-
dustry, in which I include
the press, of Pennsylvania
Gov, William W. Scranton
as a possible Presidential
candidate recalls to the
minds of many the amaz-
ing blitz which projected
Wendell Willkie into the
Presidential contest in
1940.
So many have come of
age since then and so
many have forgotten that
strange interlude that it
deserves mention.
Willkie was relatively
unknown until late in the
1930's. Then his legal
battle with the govern-
ment over the Tennessee
Valley Authority and later
his success in a nationally
broadcast debate with
Robert Jackson (later a
justice of the Supreme
Court) won some head-
lines.

The candidates who
were seeking the nomina-
tion were Thomas E. Dew-
ey and Robert A. Taft.
Dewey had been a success-
ful prosecutor of rascals in
New York and he had also
been a candidate for
governor of New York
against Herbert Lehman
in 1938 and made a good
showing. Taft was a fresh-
man senator from Ohio.
Unhappy about both
Taft and Dewey, a number
of eastern Republicans de-
cided to promote Willkie
as an alternative. The
interest of the proprietors
of a group of shiny and
nationally distributed ma-
gazines was enlisted. Fea-
ture stories in those jour-
nals began to appear de-
scribing the personal co-
lor, the lowly beginnings,
and the folksy ways of
Willkie.
The infection caught in
the press and among com-
mentators. This made talk
at Park Avenue dinner
tables, in fashionable
clubs, and among what
Dewey once called the
"station-wagon set" in the
Westchester and Connec-
ticut suburbs.
Business tycoons got in-
terested because Willkie
had defended the em-
battled utility industry.
New York internationa-
lists liked Willkie's rather
dim and general views
about hands across the
sea.
Ultimately and paradox-
ically, this favorite of the
well-born and opulent was
projected by May of that
year as a "people's
choice." And by a terrific
hullabaloo from carefully
packed galleries, along
with a Taft-Dewey dead-
lock, Willkie was nominat-
ed.

There are a number of
similarities as well as
differences in the case of
the present Scranton ex-
posure. The same commu-
nications interests are al-
ready enlisted. Business
leaders are getting inter-
ested. And the Gettys-
burg Cincinnatus has giv-
en his blessing. The infec-
tion is catching in other
segments of the press.
The theory behind this
calculated promotion is
that Goldwater has
slipped since the death of
President Kennedy; that
Rockefeller, who would
normally be the eastern
champion, is getting no-
where, and that Nixon is
unavailable.
When these publicity
drives get under way
there is altogether too
little practical weighing of
the potential of the subject
of interest when a cam-
paign gets under way
against a hard-bitten, ex-
perienced opponent alrea-
dy in the White House
with all of the assets of
great office behind him.
In Willkie's case the
battle was lost when he
made his long, rambling,
incoherent acceptance
speech in August. After
that, his supporters hys-
terically searched for
speech writers. But Will-
kie mangled their literary
efforts on the platform
and before the micro-
phone.

Scranton, who is rela-
tively new in politics,
before the big test which
would come in September
and October must acquire
the capacity and know-
how to battle Mr. Johnson
when the chips are down.
Whether he can accom-
plish this, if nominated, is
the real question and not
his capacity to get the
nomination. This is some-
thing he must consider. It
is also something that
most of his supporters now
have not taken into con-
sideration.
