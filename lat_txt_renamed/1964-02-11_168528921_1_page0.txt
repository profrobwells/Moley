Our Failures Abroad
Laid to Bureaucracy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A nationally known and
thoroughly experienced
Republican told me re-
cently of the responses he
has received from the
crowds before which he
has been making speeches
critical of the Johnson
administration.
He says that attacks on
the present budget, on
wheeler-dealing
government, on federal
welfare programs, and
even on communism in
Latin America, Africa and
Asia elicit luke-warm re-
sponses.
But when he recently
cut to the real reason why
our foreign affairs are
going so badly, the public
response was terrific.
When he says that our
State Department and our
foreign service need a
Republican President and
secretary of state who will
clean out and reorganize
the present bureaucracy,
he gets enthusiastic ap-
plause.
In this, the public shows
itself to be far ahead of
most of our opposition
political leaders and also
the President and the
secretary of state.
The blunders that lost
Cuba and are losing our
control of our own Pana-
ma Canal, that contribute
to the slaughter of Ameri-
can boys in Vietnam and
the mess in the Congo are
not always due to bad
decisions by a President.
He is the prisoner of the
people who give him ad-
vice. The real mischief is
done down below by the
bureaucracy.
★
The last secretary of
state who really ran his
own department served 40
years ago. It was Charles
Evans Hughes. Secretary
Stimson and his bureau-
crats busied themselves in
creating the Manchurian
policy which led to our
war with Japan. President
Hoover, occupied in fight-
ing the depression, had
little responsibility for
foreign policy and has said
that he realized later that
it was a mistake.
When Cordell Hull ac-
cepted the job of secretary
of state, he specifically
told President Roosevelt
that he would not be
responsible for the admi-
nistration of the State
Department. He wanted
only to impose his ideas
about lower tariffs.
And so it went, until
John Foster Dulles took
over in 1953. But Dulles
spent his time traveling
abroad to conferences.
The department ran itself.
During that time the
bureaucrats on "the
fourth floor" helped Cas-
tro get control of Cuba.
It is apparent that the
layer upon layer of offi-
cials, the innumerable
committees, the inter-rela-
tion with other agencies
such as the Defense De-
partment, AID, USIA, and
CIA all create completely
unwieldy machinery. The
wonder is that any policy
can be effectively imple-
mented at all.

A report by a subcom-
mittee headed by Sen.
Henry M. Jackson states:
"The department's
growth would dismay
even Mr. Parkinson. On
the eve of our entry into
World War II the depart-
ment employed less than
6,200 at home and over-
seas. Today, over 24,000
are on the rolls (roughly
7,000 serving in the United
States, and 17,000 abroad
--including about 10,000
foreign nationals recruited
locally).
"In the vast new State
Building a secretary sits
amidst two under secre-
taries and two deputy
under secretaries, 13 assis-
tant secretaries or their
equivalent in charge of 13
bureaus, over 30 deputy
assistant secretaries, more
than 60 area and other
office directors, and over
90 country desk officers,
together with assorted ad-
visers and special assis-
tants, counselors and in-
spector generals, and
emissaries from the
agencies that lie only
partly within the secreta-
ry's jurisdiction."
What the report, since it
is non-partisan, does not
say is that mere tinkering
with this organization can-
not suffice. What is need-
ed is a new President who
will, through a powerful
secretary of state, reorga-
nize the whole machinery
from top to bottom. Noth-
ing short of a major
operation will do. This
should be a major issue in
this year's Presidential
campaign.
