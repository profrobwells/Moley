Congress Can't Check
Big Flood of Spending
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It won't do much good
to write to your congress-
man about what President
Johnson is spending this
election year. The present
Congress can't do any-
thing about two-thirds of
what he is going to pass
out. It was authorized by
the same or other con-
gressmen and senators
back there in other years.
If you write, tell him or
her to watch what is being
authorized for next year
or the next, and so on ad
infinitum.

There is a tricky aspect
of this President's budget
and those of other Pres-
idents which Congress
has permitted over the
last generation. There are
at least two budgets-or,
rather, two ways of read-
ing the budget.
Lyndon Johnson was born
and Clarence Cannon began
to practice law in
Troy, Mo., annual appro-
priations and annual ex-
penditures were virtually
identical.
But at about the time
when Rudyard Kipling
said something about "the
brave new world," there
came the years when
people believed that they
should be "forward-look-
ing."
The idea was to borrow
from and pledge the future
for present enjoyment.
Everybody got into the
act. People bought auto-
mobiles with a down pay-
ment who had no remote
idea of where the monthly
payments were to come
from. Bankers forgot to
say "no." People bought
stock on a shoe-string
margin. All went well
until—you know when!
But Congress couldn't
go broke because it could
still borrow from the fu-
ture and saddle a new
generation with what it
spent.
An excellent publication
by the Tax Foundation (50
Rockefeller Plaza, New
New York), explains that
one budget concerns itself
with expenditures in giv-
en years. The other has to
do with what is called
"new obligational authori-
ty."
The former tells what
the President wants Con-
gress to appropriate or
what he can spend out of
what was already author-
ized before this year. The
latter is what he wants in
"new authorization au-
thority."

To show how much of
this year's spending Con-
gress can't do much about,
the Tax Foundation pre-
sents a table for fiscal
1964:
At the top of the table
is the figure which Mr.
Johnson has been boasting
about. It is the "total
estimated expenditures"
in fiscal 1964, $98.8 billion.
Even this figure, as Can-
non told the House, is
phony because there will
be many "supplemental"
appropriations.
But of this $98.8 billion,
only $30 billion can be
relatively controlled by
Congress. The remaining
$68.8 billion was already
committed before 1964.
In those wonderful,
quiet days before World
War I, when you could get
a cigar or an ice cream
soda for 5 cents, when
Many remedies have
been suggested, and one of
the best was introduced in
a bill sponsored by those
stalwart men, Sens. Harry
F. Byrd and John J.
Williams and Rep. John
W. Byrnes of Wisconsin.

This bill, if enacted,
"would amend the rules of
both the House and Sen-
ate so that all expenditure
authorizations, including
those from past years,
would be brought together
in a single bill to be known
as the General Expendi-
ture Authorization Act."
Needless to say, this bill
was not made law.
