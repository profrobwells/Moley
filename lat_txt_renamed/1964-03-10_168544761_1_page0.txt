1964 Election Prophets
Should Recall Liston
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

All of us who are
supposed to follow politi-
cal trails are being asked
hundreds of times such
questions as these: "Will
President Johnson be
elected in November?"
"Will Bobby Kennedy be
his running mate?" "Who
will get the Republican
nomination in July?"

I suggest that there be
one answer to all these
questions: "Remember the
calamitous case of Sonny
Liston."

I have the utmost re-
spect for sports writers.
The better ones are mast-
ers of colorful, lively En-
glish prose. Grantland
Rice and Bill Corum, to
mention only masters of
the past, were superb
literary craftsmen. They
were writing for an im-
mense audience which de-
manded clarity of expres-
sion. They had to be
understood, and they had
to be interesting. The late
John Lardner, my col-
league on Newsweek,
wrote prose which excited
hopeless envy in me. His
father, Ring, also a one-
time sports writer, richly
earned a place in Ameri-
can literature.

My regret as I contem-
plate the red faces of those
who were in Miami on
Feb. 25 is that they were
all so sure of the end
before it began. They
would answer that they
were merely responding
to public demands. If they
were right, they could
write another piece saying
they were right before it
happened. If they were
wrong, the public would
forget. Or, as some have
said since, "We wuz
robbed."

One respected sports
writer on the day after
blamed the build-up of
Liston on the promoters'
publicity. But the promo-
ters could scarcely have
succeeded if the writers
for the press hadn't creat-
ed the fabricated image of
Liston's invincibility.
Their present embarrass-
ment is due to the fact
that they failed to resist
public demands for pro-
phecy. To write that "any-
thing may happen" would
be dull stuff.

Most political writers
resist the public pressure
for prediction. I have
consistently belonged to
that wary group. Long
observation of the capri-
cious tides of public pre-
ferences has taught me
that no one can be sure of
what will happen in a
political convention or an
election.

The political commenta-
tor deals with very serious
business. In sports there
have been many heavy-
weight champions in
the past 30-odd years.
Some were worthy fel-
lows, and some were over-
rated clowns. But our lives
have not been affected by
who happens to wear
what sports writers call
the "heavyweight crown."
Presidents, however, are
measurably the masters of
our destiny. Their selec-
tion by voters moved by
capricious or shallow pre-
ferences affects us all.

Moreover, we know all
too well how unforeseea-
ble events can change the
course of political history.
On Nov. 22 last when I
boarded a plane in Mil-
waukee a companion
asked me, "Will President
Kennedy be re-elected?" I
answered that no one
could tell what might
happen. And when I ar-
rived in Newark the tragic
news was everywhere.

There is enough hap-
pening in the present to
satisfy any legitimate pub-
lic interest. Those whose
experience and closeness
to the scene give authority
to what they write have a
responsibility to interpret
events. They can supply
elements of significance,
sort out the irrelevant and
underline what is impor-
tant. This should keep
them busy and provide for
the public guidance. Be-
yond that, when prophecy
rears its head, awesome
political decisions become
mere sporting events.

These observations of
mine are not presented as
the essence of wisdom.
They are merely the ex-
pressions of a very cau-
tious individual. I repeat:
When you ask who will
win in November, remem-
ber Sonny Liston.
