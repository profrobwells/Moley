Credit Due Goldwater
for GOP Rise in South
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Whatever may be Barry
Goldwater's future, and
some of those who are
writing him off may be
surprised before the end of
the year one of his services
to the Republican
Party and the nation cannot
be ignored.
More than anyone else,
he deserves credit for the
rise of a two-party system
in the South. Ten years of
indefaitable crusading
for conservative principles
have given shape, direction,
and hope to countless
people, mostly young
people, in the South who
have been unhappy over
the years with the take-it-
or-leave-it solid Democratic
Party in those states.
Since traditionally the
Southern voter has had to
consider personalities
rather than parties, it took
a strong and attractive
personality to become the
basis of a Republican
Party. Goldwater supplied
that necessity. He became
the symbol of deliverance
from one-party rule.
*
For that reason, the
new and growing Republican
leadership is generally
identical with the Goldwater-
or-President movement.
However, it cannot be
assured that if Goldwater
should be eliminated as a
Presidential contender the
new Republican Party in
the South would disappear.
For the principle would
remain, and the party
machinery to give it implementation
would still
grow and in some states
take over the government.
After a week of study
and observation in South
Carolina, Georgia, and
Alabama, I am unable to
assess the present status
of Goldwater sentiment
among voters. But I can
say positively that no poll
can accurately show that
status.
It is true that the
enthusiasm for Goldwater
is somewhat less than it
was when I visited the
same states 11 months ago.
But he had so much
momentum then that the
letdown after the death of
President Kennedy still
leaves him the outstanding
favorite among politically
minded people.
The acquisition of Gold-
water delegates provides
something of more statistical
significance than the
measurement of opinion.
And here Goldwater's fortunes
are growing.
John E. Grenier, the
capable Republican state
chairman in Alabama, has
been charged with gathering
delegates pledged or
Moley
favorable to Goldwater in
the 11 southern states.
The business of selecting
delegates is going on at
this time in all these
states.
Grenier, only 33 years of
age, has a special genius
for organizational work.
Within the next few
weeks all the delegates
from these states will be
chosen, and most will be
committed or pledged to
Goldwater. Some have already
been selected.
Grenier estimates that
of the total of 279 representing
the 11 states in
Grenier's jurisdiction, a
minimum of 250 will vote
for Goldwater on the first
ballot in San Francisco,
and most of these will be
prepared to stick until
released or until Goldwater
is nominated.
*
I believe that this estimate
involves little wishful
thinking. For Grenier
is a very realistic man.
There are some sticky
situations in delegate selection
in Florida and
Arkansas. But North Carolina
is safely for Goldwater,
except for perhaps one
or two delegates.
Some trouble may arise
in central Tennessee. But
South Carolina, Georgia,
Louisiana, and Texas are
safe. The result in New
Hampshire will have little
effect upon this strength
from the South.
