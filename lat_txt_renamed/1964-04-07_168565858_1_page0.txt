The Civil Rights Bill
and the Republicans
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the preliminary
skirmishing over the civil
rights bill a majority of
the Republicans in the
Senate, despite the posi-
tlon taken by Minority
Leader Everett M. Dirk-
sen, voted with the admi-
nistration.
This followed the ex-
ample of many Republi-
cans in the House who
made little or no effort to
amend the bill. Indeed, the
Republican leadership
in the House seemed
willing to pass the re-
sponsibility on to the
Senate, to the President,
and to the Supreme Court,
despite certain glaring
injustices in the bill, as
well as its doubtful con-
stitutionality.
This Republican posture
in Congress deserves criti-
cal examination. Perhaps
It is due to the fact that
there is no Republican
President in the White
House to rally behind. Per-
haps it is due to confusion
among so many Republi-
cans as to what position
their party should take in
the forthcoming Presiden-
tial campaign.
â˜…
But mostly it seems to
be due to the belief of
members that they can
best insure their political
interests by following
what they conceive to be
the wishes of their local
and state constituents.
This is hardly an example
of real statesmanship and
party responsibility.
For this is a very bad
bill. Some of its provisions
would stretch the terms of
the Constitution far be-
yond any of the interpre-
tations of the past. It is in
violation of property
rights and personal liberty
-a violation which may
in the end visit itself upon
both Negro and white ci-
tizens.
It would establish police
authority at the federal
level which might well be
dangerous. It would lead
into a morass of litigation
which could extend for
years in the future. And,
finally, it is a bill which
has been proposed by the
administration and writ-
ten by its authors under
the threat of unspecified
"action" by Negro leaders.
In that connection, it
should be noted that Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, the
bill's major sponsor, ar-
ranged a press conference
in his office for the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
At that meeting, King
said that if this bill does
not pass, it would be har-
der "to keep the struggle
non-violent and disci-
plined." He also specified
that "about a month
would be adequate to de-
bate the bill."
Thus, the threat of vi-
olence is coupled with
what amounts to an order
to the Senate to limit itself
to a specified time to con-
sider vital legislation for
which Congress must be
responsible not to any
minority but to the nation
it is supposed to serve.
If, as is quite obvious,
the acquiescence of Re-
publicans in this matter is
dictated by political con-
siderations, those Repub-
licans might note a num-
ber of political facts. They
may be and probably are
wrong in their estimate of
the attitude of their con-
stituents.
Even in the Northern
states and California,
where large numbers of
Negro voters reside, there
is growing resentment of
the extremism repre-
sented in this bill. Even in
New York City, where it is
supposed that integration
sentiment is greatest, the
representatives of the
professional supervisory
people in the schools have
announced their opposi-
tion to the extreme mea-
sures which seem to have
been accepted by the city
government and the board
of education.
These professional su-
pervisors, it should be
noted, are the people who
must grapple with the
practical implications of
extreme measures of in-
tegration. Among these
are the carrying of child-
ren in busses over the city
to integrate schools, de-
spite geographical logic.
There is also growing
concern in many northern
cities about the perils of
personal attacks upon
teachers.
Moreover, Republican
members of Congress who
blindly follow the com-
mand of the administra-
tion might well consider
the state of their party
nationally. Tendencies to
turn the party toward
liberal policies, especially
during the Eisenhower
administration, have
gained nothing and lost
much.
Those Republican
members of Congress
might well look at the size
of their own membership
to see the proof of this. In
1951, with President
Harry S. Truman in the
White House, there were
47 Republican senators
and 199 Republicans in
the House.
But in 1959, after seven
years during which Pres-
ident Dwight D. Eisen-
hower attempted to liber-
alize the party, there were
only 34 Republican sena-
tors and 153 Republicans
in the House. There was a
minute Republican gain in
1960, but after the 1962
election the decline began
again.
This was no doubt due
to the failure of Republi-
cans to offer a sharp al-
ternative to the liberal
Democratic policies. Thus,
me-tooism lost, rather
than gained, public sup-
port.
But this fact apparently
seems lost upon many Re-
publicans in Congress.
