Oregon Campaigning
Exercise in Futility
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Further campaigning in
Oregon by Sen. Barry
Goldwater and Gov. Nel-
son A. Rockefeller would
be an exercise in futility.
They have their names on
the ballot. They have or-
ganized efforts in their
behalf up there. Both men
have said their say, over
and over.
But if the polls are even
partly reliable, the people
of Oregon, like their fellow
citizens in New Hamp-
shire, prefer to vote for
people who are not can-
didates, who have not
appeared in the state and
do not intend to visit it.
And one of these favored
ones is half a world away
doing some rather undis-
tinguished work in losing
a war for a Democratic
President.
Goldwater has ob-
viously come to realize the
futility of the Oregon
operation, for he has can-
celed all his engagements
there except one on May
14, eve of the primary.
Goldwater made the
point in his announcement
that he was not interested
in running against
"phantom candidates."

How these "phantoms"
happen to be on the
Oregon ballot is a sad
commentary on the pri-
mary system and the
Oregon laws in particular.
It would seem that the
state of Oregon carefully
designed its system to
make it a grotesque
travesty. Under the law,
the secretary of state of
the commonwealth leafs
over the newspapers ev-
ery four years and arbi-
trarily selects the name of
everyone who has been
mentioned as a possible
candidate for the Pres-
idency.
Then he has these
names printed on the bal-
lot regardless of whether
they are candidates and
entirely without their
permission. Specifically,
the law says the secretary
of state "in his own dis-
cretion" shall place on the
ballot the names of such as
are "generally advocated
or recognized in their na-
tional news media
throughout the United
States" as Presidential
possibilities.
If, in his newspaper
reading, the secretary of
state misses someone and
that person wishes to get
on the ballot, he needs
only 1,000 names on a pe-
tition to join the melee.
And so there were se-
lected, in addition to
Goldwater and Rockefel-
ler, Govs. George Romney
and William Scranton,
Moley
Sen. Margaret Chase
Smith and Richard M.
Nixon.
Romney took advantage
of the law which permits a
person thus selected to get
off the ballot. He had to
file an affidavit saying
that he "is not now and
does not intend to be a
candidate."
The purpose of the
primary system, if it has
any real purpose, when it
was adopted back in that
era of "progressive" non-
sense, was that two or
more candidates for a
party's nomination should
come to the state con-
cerned and the votes
thereof should direct the
party delegates to vote for
that choice.
*
As is now clear, a re-
quirement that a candi-
date appear in even a
majority of the states
where Presidential pri-
maries are held would
require that individual to
have these qualifications:
no occupation or business
other than running for of-
fice; be a man in the prime
of his life with a cast iron
physique; have unlimited
money; and neglect two-
thirds of the states where
there are no primaries.
Oregon, by adding the
refinements described
above, has reduced the so-
called system to its most
absurd pattern.
