Flaws in Foundation of Political
Poll-Taking Limit Its Usefulness
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Back in the 1920s,
young academic teachers
of what is called political
science believed that they
saw a bright light and a
dazzling breakthrough.
Two ideas were not ne-
cessarily new, but in the
context of politics they
were hailed as the begin-
ning of a new era in poli-
tical analysis.
The first was known in
academic terms as the
"economic interpretation
of politics." While this had
been given prominence by
Marx and Marxists, it was
of earlier origins. It heid
that people's (and in the
new context, voters')
choices were determined
by "empirical data." The
people who operate the
computers are still en-
thralled by this quackery.

The other "discovery"
of those years was politi-
cal prognosis by polling.
We—for I, too, was a ju-
nior political science
professor at that time—
greeted this innovation
with the enthusiasm
which in other phases of
knowledge greeted the
discoveries of Harvey
and Salk. Like arc weld-
ing, poll-taking was first a
gadget and finally big
business. But arc welding
really stuck things together.
Polls leave everyone
confused.
After my initial enthu-
siasm subsided, my ob-
servations and cogitations
brought me finally to my
present state of disbelief.
The first qualification in
my mind was this: If there
could be a poll on, say,
October 1 which people
believed to be perfectly
accurate, the preferences
of many of them would
change before November.
Some would follow the
Pickwickian counsel and
shout with the larger
crowd. Others, who had
been only casually inter-
ested in politics, would
think more about the
prospective winner and
perhaps decide against
him. Political managers
would intensify their ef-
forts in doubtful areas,
deploy their workers and
money, and thus change
many minds while they
planned to carry or drag
their supporters to the
election booths on election
day. The result, then,
would be substantially
different from the poll-
sters' predictions.
Another consideration,
born of experience with
human beings, was that
while a large number of
voters are creatures of
habit and follow the poli-
tical parties of their fore-
fathers, many others care
nothing at all about poli-
tics and don't actually
know what their choice
would be. But since almost
everyone wants to appear
informed and thoughtful,
these ignorant and indif-
ferent people often re-
spond with sharp and
clear preferences. Still
others neglect a decision
until a day or two before
election. These tell the
polltakers that they are
undecided. And the sum
total of the undecided
usually decides elections.

Since people who are
approached by a stranger
with a notebook become
immediately suspicious,
many people are afraid
that their friends and
neighbors may learn their
choice, and so they an-
swer, if they answer at all,
with a choice which will
not impair their personal
relations. This would be
especially true in a labor-
union community.
In 1950 in England I
learned that many wo-
men, the wives of trade
unionists, had been asking
reporters whether their
husbands could find out
how they had voted. I de-
cided then that this would
mean heavy losses for the
Labor Party. That is what
happened.
But here is the rub:
How many people really
tell the truth to the poll-
taker? In that British
campaign in 1950 I asked
Herbert Morrison, the
second-in-command in the
Labor Party, what al-
lowance they made in
their "canvasses" for
people who did not tell the
truth. He said, "About
30%." Then I asked a
member of the Conser-
vative high command the
same question. He said,
"About 25%."
Thus, the cunning, the
indecision, the ignorance,
and the apathy of human
beings defeat the most
strenuous efforts of the
polisters.
Finally, since abstention
from voting is an Ameri-
can habit, no pollster can
tell whether the people he
counts will vote.
To be sure, the pollsters
now seek to determine
"trends" by successive
polls. But here they are
confronted with keeping
up with rapidly changing
preferences. I cannot be-
lieve that one pre-primary
California pollster could
possibly have found the
changes that he reported
from Saturday to Monday,
certainly not in as big a
state as California.
★
One pollster since that
primary has covered his
mistakes by saying that
the polls were accurate
"when they were taken."
That is a perfect bomb-
shelter. For no one, not
even the pollsters, can
prove such an assertion.
Perhaps with a bit of
humility on the part of the
pollsters and plenty of
public criticism of their
silly predictions, these
people can perform a
useful service. But I have
profound doubts about
that. Up to now, they have
badly served the efforts of
Americans to create a
better political system.
