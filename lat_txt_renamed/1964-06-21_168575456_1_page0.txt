Scranton's Role as a Sacrificial
Goat Cannot Be a Very Happy One
CLAREMONT—The
political events during the
week which began on
Sunday, June 7, will live
long in Republican annals.
Nothing that happened
seemed to follow logically
from anything else that
happened.
I shall always associate
those days with Route 66,
not because they resembled
the improbable
dramas on the television
show that goes by that
name, but because I was
in an automobile driving
from New York to California.
Four of those days
were on Route 66.
Whenever I stopped for
lunch or the night, the
newspapers available in
that section contained
startling new and incomprehensible
changes in
the situation—if it could
be called a situation.
★
Now that Gov. Scranton
seems to have made a decision
which will measurably
last for a month,
there is a moment for reflection.
While I do not
rule out the possibility
that Sen. Goldwater may
be denied the nomination,
the projection of Scranton
into the field seems to
have been an act of rash
impulse. People who expect
to win a nomination
in modern times plan their
operation far in advance.
Witness John F. Kennedy
and Richard M. Nixon in
1960 and Gov. Rockefeller
and Goldwater this year.
Adequate organization
means at least two sorts of
workers. There must be a
group headed by an experienced
professional to
tour the nation and make
contacts with state party
leaders. This is for the
purpose of getting delegates.
Then there must be
a group to examine the
issues and prepare position
papers and speeches.
The workers in these
groups must be expert in
their areas of operation.
Scranton apparently
has had no such helpers.
All he has had are a few
politicians in Pennsylvania
who helped in his
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
campaign for governor.
He himself has only
sketchy ideas on national
issues picked up during
only two years in Congress,
from the newspapers,
or from well-wishers
on the telephone who figured
so much in his decisions.
It has also been the
custom in recent years for
a successful nominee to
carry his pre-convention
organization with him into
the campaign. If Scranton
should get the nomination
he will be expected to join
in a conflict with a President
who has had vast
experience in both houses
of Congress and who as
vice president and President
has had access to all
the knowledge possessed
by a vast federal establishment.
Johnson is also
a master of political
strategy and techniques,
perhaps the best since
FDR.

The platitudes and
wisecracks which Scranton
has put in evidence
since his decision would
not avail in such a contest.
It would be pitting a novice
against one of the
major professionals of our
time.
His success in winning
the electoral votes of
many states, if he should
get the nomination, would
mean that in at least two-thirds
of these states he
would have to depend
upon state and local organizations
which have
been committed to Gold-
water. They will view the
rejection of Goldwater
with lasting resentment.
Money cannot fill this lack
of organized support. Nor
can a vast campaign of
publicity in the press and
over the air waves carry a
candidate.
As a matter of record,
Scranton has already had
the publicity putsch. Two
months ago there was a
concerted effort on the
part of many publications
to create a boom for
Scranton. It failed because
Scranton couldn't make
up his mind to be a candidate
and also because
the bright pictures of
Scranton, his family, his
brief career in politics,
and his harmless avocations
failed to catch hold.
There can scarcely be an
effective rerun of this
publicity material in the
time that remains.
Those who urged him to
enter at this late date and
who have joyfully greeted
his candidacy are for the
most part amateurs or
they are backers of Rockefeller,
Lodge, and others
who now find themselves
unemployed.

Those who urged the
governor to make this
strange decision should
realize that the prospect of
success in a national election
by the votes of a few
Northeastern states, with
much of the Middlewest,
the West, and the South
apathetic and indifferent,
would be hopeless. Or are
these people determined
to bring the Republican
Party down to defeat? For
Scranton, by all the measurements,
is only a sectional
candidate. He is little
known beyond the
state in which he lives and
some neighboring commonwealths.
Even Willkie
had roots west of Pennsylvania.
The role assumed by
Scranton as a sacrificial
offering is not a happy
one, nor is it one which
would be conducive to a
bright future for the victim.
