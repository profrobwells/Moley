Advice to Public While Awaiting
the Convention: Just Play It Cool
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the final days before
any contest that captures
widespread interest, the
public is generally over-
whelmed by a mass of in-
formation, misinformation,
rumors, guesses,
predictions and propa-
ganda by the special in-
terests concerned. This is
true of a murder trial, a
championship prize fight,
a world's series, primaries,
conventions, and elections.
It is not strange that a
good deal of it finds its
way into the media of
news and opinion. For
these media are created to
interest and inform the
public. And the public is
always interested in what
has been unexpected.
The best advice at this
moment for Mr. and Mrs.
Public is to keep calm,
drink plenty of cool water,
and get eight hours of
sleep. Much of what you
are hearing is not so, is not
important, or is designed
to alarm you.

Bear in mind that the
method by which Presidential
candidates are
named was created about
130 years ago. It is not
perfect. No man-made in-
stitution is perfect. But it
is the best way a nation
knows to govern itself in
this vital area.
The convention is a
form of representative
government. Delegates are
selected by one method or
another and then are
supposed to vote as they
believe best for their party
or according to the directives
of their constituents.
In the present instance
the contest is between
Sen. Barry Goldwater and
those who are against him.
In certain mysterious
ways that need not be de-
scribed here Gov. William
Scranton has been se-
lected to challenge the
leading contender. If the
wheel of chance had
stopped somewhere else,
the name might have been
Rockefeller, Lodge, Nixon,
or Stassen.
This is not a choice that
is seriously based upon a
widespread conviction
that this estimable young
man is best qualified to be
President of the United
States. His official record
is scanty and his views
have yet to be promulgated. He is against
somebody and is seeking
to show by various weird
conjugations of figures that
the nomination of that
somebody is not the choice
of Republicans, and (b)
that President Johnson
would beat that somebody.
To accomplish this
purpose, he is driving at a
spot in politicians' armor
which has been vulnerable
in the past. He is
telling delegates that the
man to whom they are
either legally or morally
committed can't win if
nominated. This tactic
worked in 1852 when the
same method was used
against the late Sen. Taft.
It is cynical attack, be-
cause it is based upon the
assumption that the political
people who have
been selected as delegates
would, if their self-interest
dictates, abandon commitments, desert their in-
structions, and break their
promises. This is not nice
conduct for a young and
promising man who is just
starting a career in national
politics.
To achieve this purpose,
the people who are guiding
his fortunes have
brought out the pollsters
from their temporary loss
of face after their egregious
mistakes in Oregon
and California to prove a
case against Goldwater.
Working for the Scranton
objective is a back-
wash of bitter propaganda
against Goldwater which
has been continuous for
two years. The misinterpretation of Goldwater's
position has been repeated so often that it is
assumed that what was
once doubted and denied
will be accepted as true.
But is this the way to
select or not to select a
candidate for President of
the United States? Can
these activists against
Goldwater support a man
for President whom they
have repeatedly called an
enemy of the republic and
a peril to the peace of the
world?
â˜…
They can and will. And
will once more prove how
cynical is the practice of
their profession.
So I repeat my advice.
Keep calm. Take plenty of
salt with your daily dose
of information. And let the
delegates decide. For the
convention is the method
Americans have chosen to
select their candidates,
after generations of trial
and error.
