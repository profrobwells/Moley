Latest Developments in the Congo
Show the Errors of U.S. Policy

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If the traditions which
prevail in the British
government were ob-
served here, the resigna-
tions of Dean Rusk, Adlai
Stevenson, and others in
the Administration would
now be on the President's
desk. For the brutal folly
of our policy in the Congo
is now exposed for what it
was.

When the sorry busi-
ness began over there
more than three years ago,
there were many voices
raised in protest here. The
most powerful was that of
Sen. Thomas Dodd of
Connecticut. Some press
commentators were also
highly critical and I did a
modest bit myself.

But, in general, Amer-
icans were led to believe
that Moise Tshombe was a
rebel, that his supporters
were mercenaries, and
that Katanga was barring
the way to the establish-
ment of democratic
government in the vast
reaches of the Congolese
jungles. It was also bla-
zoned through our media
of communication that the
government in Katanga
was a remnant of evil co-
lonialism and that the
Union Miniere was a form
of capitalist exploitation
which must be eradicated.

It didn't seem to matter
much to our makers of
foreign policy that our
best friends in Europe—
the British, the French,
and the Belgians—were
stunned by our support of
the United Nations in
what was called a "peace-
keeping" military action
against Katanga in ge-
neral and Tshombe in
particular.

Our government poured
money and material into
the action. Our allies were
savage Gurkhas and an
assortment of troops
gathered from various na-
tions. Included among
these, to the everlasting
shame of Irishmen, there
were troops from their
nation, which had fought

so hard for its own inde-
pendence.

The war went on re-
lentlessly. Katanga was
subjugated. Its capital was
partly demolished. Va-
luable industrial ma-
chinery, the source of
employment for many na-
tives, was destroyed. And
Tshombe was driven into
exile. And so the war to
make the Congo safe for
democracy ended in 1963.

But while it was easy
for Adlai Stevenson to co-
gitate in the United Na-
tions about creating de-
mocracy with stable
government, elements for
such an establishment
were not there. United
Nations forces lingered on
while the tribesmen were
busily massacring each
other.

Finally, the whole jerry-
built contraption broke
down. As the United Na-
tions forces prepared to
leave, the stark truth was
revealed. There was no
one to create even the
semblance of stability but
Tshombe, and so he is
back at the head of a

government for all of the
Congo when four years
ago all he wanted was to
maintain a viable govern-
ment in Katanga alone.

It is not without a touch
of irony that Tshombe has
assumed, among other of-
fices in the new govern-
ment, the ministry of
foreign affairs. Thus, our
Secretary of State must
deal on a basis of interna-
tional comity with the
very man he regarded as
an arrant knave only a
short time ago.

One of the most absurd
aspects of the aftermath is
the recently revealed in-
tention of the Johnson
administration to pay for
the return to the Congo of
some 10,000 Belgians, who
presumably were driven
out during the invasion.
The estimated cost of this
will be, it is reported, be-
tween $80 million and
$100 million. Thus we first
spend twice that amount
to drive these people out,
and then pay their return
fare.
