Adverse Canadian Reaction to OAS
Cuba Sanctions Shows Ill Feeling

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Canadian reaction to the
recent declarations agreed
to by the foreign ministers
of 15 members of the Or-
ganization of American
States is a clear indication
of how far our relations
with our neighbor have
deteriorated in recent
years.

The authoritative, al-
though unofficial news-
paper, the Globe and
Mail, published in Toron-
to, notes that while the so-
called "sanctions" against
Castro's Cuba are little
more than a reaffirmation
of what have been in ex-
istence before, the vote on
these resolutions shows
quite plainly how deeply
divided are the Latin
American states in their
attitude toward Cuba.

This is a source of sa-
tisfaction to this Canadian
publication since the
government and trading
interests of the Dominion
have been enjoying a
thriving business with
Castro during all of our
troubles with the dictator,
The Globe and Mail says
that the meeting of the
foreign ministers "has
provided the world with a
working demonstration of
U.S. colonialism: how
many of the states which
voted with the United
States are heavily depend-
ent upon U.S. aid?"

The use of the word
"colonialism" is merely a
milder form of what Cas-
tro himself would say. His
term would be "capitalis-
tic imperialism."

The Canadian argument
is that the OAS foreign
ministers should have
used this occasion to open
up negotiations with Cas-
tro, looking toward a final
settlement under which
the Communist dictator
will be accepted as a cozy
neighbor by the countries
he has already attempted
to subvert and take over in
the name of his masters in
Moscow and Peking.

It seems to be assumed
that certain statements
among the mass of ver-
biage which Castro has
Iposed upon us indicate his
desire to establish peace-
ful relations.

The Globe and Mail says that Castro has agreed to
stop supporting revolu-
tionary movements in La-
tin American countries.
This promise would be
conditioned upon our
agreement to stop all
support of revolutionary
efforts in the OAS member
nations aimed at the
overthrow of Castro. The
Canadian view is that
Castro has been more
sinned against than sin-
ning.

Another "concession"
which the Globe and Mail
hails is a suggestion by
Castro that he will be
willing to pull back Cuban
guards around the U.S.
base at Guantanamo "by
several hundred yards" as
a part of his friendly ges-
tures. As if it makes any
difference to the United
States whether there are
Cuban "guards" around
our naval base or not!

The Canadian lament is
that the United States
seems unwilling to put
Castro's "good" profes-
sions to the test. But the
sort of "test" which is
implied is that we accept
as permanent a Commu-
nist dictatorship at our
shores, that we accept as
permanent that country's occupation by Soviet for-
ces. that we labor to
prevent Cuban exiles who
have sought asylum here
from seeking a restoration
of their country's affairs to
the people of that country
under constitutional
means. This is no "test"
that the United States is
willing to provide.

It is well and good for
Canadians to counsel us
when they know that,
were it not for the United
States' armed might, there
would be plenty of Com-
munist penetration in
their own rich provinces.

But the Globe and Mail
poses a rather strange
threat: "Or is the United
States determined to ever-
throw the Castro
government? If that is the
case, then the U.S. pre-
mise is quite unaccep-
table and will only draw to
Cuba's support the West-
ern democracies as well as
the Communist bloc."

To be sure, Canada can
only speak for herself. But
even this presentation of
such an alternative seems
strange in the light of the
ties which have bound our
mutual interests.
