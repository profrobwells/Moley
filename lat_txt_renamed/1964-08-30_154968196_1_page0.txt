Though Obscured by Conventions,
Reapportionment Issue Still Lives

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The clamor at Atlantic
City, at which preordained
decisions were loudly ar-
rived at, temporarily ob-
scured an issue facing
Congress, 50 semi-sover-
eign states, and American
citizens generally. At issue
is what to do about the
June 15th decision of the
Supreme Court com-
manding the reappor-
tionment of both houses of
state legislatures solely on
the basis of population.

In the House of Repre-
sentatives the Tuck bill
was passed by the very
significant vote of 218 to
175. In the debate and vote
on this measure, party
lines played no significant
part. Voting for the bill
were 122 Republicans and
96 Democrats: opposed
were 140 Democrats and
35 Republicans.

The bill, if enacted into
law, would deny to the
federal courts jurisdiction
over all cases involving
the apportionment of state
legislatures. In my judg-
ment and in that of many
distinguished lawyers, the
Tuck measure is perfectly
constitutional.

In the Senate a milder
approach is proposed. This
is the Dirksen amend-
ment, which would post-
pone action to allow the
state legislatures elected
this year or next to reap-
portion before 1966.

Presumably this stay
of execution would premit
Congress to consider and
present to the states a con-
stitutional amendment
clarifying the basis upon
which states may in their
own right set up the le-
gislatures which make the
laws under which their
people must live and
which they should obey.
Several decisions of the
Supreme Court in 1962,
1963 and this year have
thrust the federal courts
into this matter through a
devious and highly ques-
tionable extension of the
vague powers conferred
by the 14th Amendment.

The first affirmation
of the new doctrine by the
court's majority was in
the Baker vs. Carr case,
decided in 1962. This con-
cerned the apportionment

of seats in the Tennessee
General Assembly. This
declared, in effect, that the
1901 apportionment was
unconstitutional and that
a new one should be made
giving major attention to
representation according
to population.

Then there was another
decision, in 1963, striking
down the county system in
Georgia. Early this year,
another decision directed
a redistricting of Georgia's
congressional districts,
declaring that "as nearly
as practicable one man's
vote in a congressional
election must be worth as
much as another's."

Justice Frankfurter's
dissent in Baker vs. Carr
was the finest and, as it
proved, the final one of his
career. He contended with
great vigor and logic that
apportionment was a poli-
tical, not a judicial con-
cern. He also denied that
apportionment strictly on
the basis of population was
consonant with the estab-
lished principle of repre-
sentative government.

The cases which have
provoked the present cri-
sis in Congress, decided
this June, were directed at
Alabama, New York, Ma-
ryland, Virginia, Dela-
ware and Colorado. In

this, the majority opinion
boldly usurped the au-
thority of states and read
new and strange mean-
ings into the Constitution.
But the charges of usur-
pation are not all. The
court's decisions are ir-
responsible.

Justice Stewart, who
concurred in Baker vs.
Carr, pointed out in dis-
senting in these 1964 cases
that the court's "draco-
nian pronouncement"
makes the legislatures of
50 states unconstitutional.
Utter chaos may result,
unless Congress finds a
way to check this inter-
ference. For, as Stewart
said further, states differ
in interests and consti-
tuencies. What "might be
best for South Dakota
might be unwise for Ha-
waii with its many islands
or Michigan with its
Northern peninsula.
Montana with its vast
distances is not Rhode Is-
land with its heavy con-
centration of people."

He also asked, if this
principle of "one man one
vote" prevails, why have
districts at all? Why not
hold "all elections at
large"?

This is the issue, and it
involves the essential na-
ture of the republic itself.
