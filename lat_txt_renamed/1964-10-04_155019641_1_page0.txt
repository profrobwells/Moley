The Three Faces of Earl Warren
Are Evident in the Slaying Report
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The capacity of Earl
Warren to bring a major-
ity of whatever group over
which he presides to his
way of thinking has been
demonstrated for more
than 10 years in the major
decisions of the Supreme
Court. Therefore, it is no
surprise that in the report
on the murder of Pres-
ident Kennedy there is a
heavy imprint of the
commission's chairman.

On the one hand there is
a thoroughness of detail
which is the mark of a
great criminal prosecutor.
There is also evidence of
Warren's capacity as an
administrator. On the
other, there is an almost
sentimental treatment of
human motives and ac-
tions.
★
Thirty-seven years ago,
in 1927, I had a grant as a
professor at Columbia
University which enabled
me to write a book on
criminal prosecution. My
work on this carried me to
the offices of prosecutors
in most of the major cities
in the United States. I thus
acquired knowledge
which enabled me to form
a number of what those
who reviewed the book
called valid comparisons
and contrasts. In this tour
of duty I visited Warren,
who at that time was dis-
trict attorney in Oakland,
Cal.

I said at the time that
Warren was the most
competent prosecuting of-
ficer in the United States.
Years later, Warren
quoted this statement
when he was a candidate
for the Presidential nom-
ination.

His virtue as a criminal
investigator was not
marked by histrionic per-
formances in court.
Rather, it was his extra-
ordinary capacity to or-
ganize his office so that
every detail related to the
crime might be presented
to the court. His efficiency


was so great that in an
autobiography by a re-
formed crook named Jack
Black it was said that,
while malefactors might
live in Oakland, they
never committed a crime
in that jurisdiction. In-
Moley
stead they preyed upon
San Francisco and other
places.

Warren's capacity as an
administrator has since
been shown in his career
as attorney general and
governor of his state. He
also runs the Supreme
Court with the same ad-
ministrative ability.

But even long ago and
later as governor and chief
justice there was a notable
Warren affinity for ex-
cursions into the never-
never land of modern so-
ciological and psycholo-
gical motivation rather
than more obvious and
direct interpretations of
criminal acts. Some
have called the Warren
trait sentimentalism. But
his unwillingness to reach
more traditional conclu-
sions has always been
completely sincere.

These three elements in
the Warren method are
clearly written in the
voluminous text of the
Warren report. It is an
amazingly complete ac-
count of the events in-
volved in the Oswald and
Ruby crimes. It shows
remarkable attention to

the marshalling of multi-
tudinous facts. Clearly, the
researches were complete
and exhaustive and will
stand for decades to come
as the most gripping
mystery story of a gener-
ation.

But, in getting at Os-
wald's motives and
methods, it will leave a
trail of controversy which
may never end.

The report seems to
have been on solid factual
ground in saying that
Oswald acted alone and
unconnected with any
specific contacts outside
himself. The researches to
determine this seem to be
quite complete.

Oswald was a loner.
And, as the report says,
"His life was character-
ized by isolation, frustra-
tion and failure. It is ap-
parent . . . that Oswald
was moved by an over-
riding hostility to his en-
vironment. He does not
appear to have been able
to establish meaningful
relationships with other
people."

But it must be added
that even such an in-
wardly directed individual
still was under the in-
fluence of the psycholo-
gical climate in which he
lived. Since in that climate
there is the terrific conflict
between two or more sys-
tems of life, this measura-
bly controlled his emotions
and his thinking. It would
be easy to draw the con-
clusion, as so many have,
that he drew from this
atmosphere a hatred of
American capitalist society
and some affinity for the
Marxist philosophy of a
deadly conflict. But, pro-
bably wisely, the Warren
report refrains from such a
conclusion.

Thus, we must leave
this strange and compli-
cated story to the histor-
ians, the lawyers and the
writers of fiction about
truth.
