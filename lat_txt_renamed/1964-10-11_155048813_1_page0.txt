New York City has al-
ways been a place which
has drawn the attention of
the nation and a good part
of the world. Visitors come
from everywhere to see, to
be entertained, and per-
haps to be inspired and in-
structed. This year it has,
beyond all other attrac-
tions, the colossal World's
Fair.
But the nation at large
has never admired the po-
litical life of the great city
on the bay and on the sea.
It is interesting to note
that the New York gover-
nors who since Lincoln
have been honored by
their party's Presidential
nomination have been in-
dividuals who have de-
spised and fought Tamma-
ny Hallâ€”Tilden, Cleve-
land, the two Roosevelts,
Hughes, and Dewey. And
by the time he ran for
President, the unforgotten
Alfred E. Smith had mea-
surably broken all ties
with New York City's De-
mocrats.
In earlier years Tamma-
ny was a bete noir to
all virtuous people every-
where. Tammany is no
more, but the factors
which made Tammany
possible are still present in
this, the grimiest cam-
paign I have ever wit-
nessed here in the city. All
the factors, that is, but mu-
nicipal corruption. And
this is not a year for the
election of city officials.
On the Republican side,
the major source of these
campaign conditions is the
dislocation of the Republi-
can Party in the state from
the national party. This
dislocation rises from the
outcome of the revolution
in the Republican Party in
San Francisco in July.
That was a revolt by Re-
publicans in the West and
South against domination
of the GOP by the East
and the Northeast. The af-
termath of resentment
here is against Sen. Gold-
water, although he was on-
ly the symbol of a revolt
which had been gathering
force for years.
Thus, many New York-
ers choose to consider
themselves as refugees
from the national Republi-
can Party.
A basic political phen-
omenon now reveals itself.
Close students of political
life have repeatedly noted
that wherever a system of
non-partisanship is esta-
blished, the loyalties of
people do not take the
high road to an idealistic
home. Rather, they turn to
other attachments, such as
religion, race, national ori-
gins, or the specific econ-
omic minorities of which
they are a part.
This has happened in
New York City in this
campaign, and the appeals
of Sen. Keating and of his
opponent, Robert Kenne-
dy, and of other candi-
dates for lesser offices are
made according to the in-
terests of this or that min-
ority.
Those who have pre-
viously known Kenneth
Keating as a decent and
useful public servant can-
not but feel grief when
they see his meanderings
in search of votes and his
appeals to this or that sel-
fish minority interest.
Robert Kennedy finds it
quite comfortable to
pursue the same pathway.
One of the most ludicrous
manifestations of this was
when Kennedy crashed in-
to a parade of Polish-
Americans. Those in
charge didn't invite him.
He simply walked along
with the fellow country-
men of Pulaski and Cho-
pin, and Paderewski, lone-
ly as a cloud, like a way-
ward float.
His entrance into this
campaign was a joint ma-
nifestation of his own gall
and the lack of talent in
the Democratic Party.
Confronted as the New
York Democrats were
with nobody suitable to re-
present the "great" state
of New York, they accept-
ed this adventurer from
somewhere else.
And so many citizens of
New York, like this writer,
have no choice but to vote
for Keating despite his
party apostacy and his ap-
peals to selfish minorities.
For his appeals of this sort
are substantially forced
upon him by the unique
conditions that prevail in
New York City.
