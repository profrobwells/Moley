**Personal Tribute Paid to President Hoover**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The abundantly earned love for me, leaked a
tributes to Herbert Hoover strange story to two gossip
now, on the occasion of the columnists to the effect
end of his incalculably use- that there had been a
ful life, are mostly from Hoover-Roosevelt ex-
those who knew him only change and that the two

I am a fortunate survi-
vor of the years of his
greatest trials—his strug-
gle to stem the great de-
pression, his final and un-
successful campaign for
re-election, his role in the
critical months between
the election of 1932 and
President Roosevelt's in-
auguration in March 1933.

As the chief of Gov.
Roosevelt’s policy group in
the 1932 campaign, I re-
mained as the President-
elect’s personal agent in
the period before the inau-
guration. At President
Hoover’s request, Mr.
Roosevelt met him in the
White House two weeks
after the election. The
President-elect took me
with him as a sort of minis-
ter without portfolio. Mr.
Hoover had his Treasury
Secretary, the late Ogden
Mills, at the meeting.
There began then a series
of contacts concerning the
critical state of the nation,
its banks and its economy,
generally and the debts
owed us by European na-
tions.
Those contacts were in
effect a conflict between
two perfectly sincerely
held but irreconcilable
courses of action. I ad-
hered, and I still believe I
was right, to the Roosevelt
policy.

Six years later, after Mr.
Roosevelt and the Demo-
cratic Party had taken an-
other turn of policy, I
wrote a series of magazine
articles and a book which
rejected not only the
Hoover policies of those
months after the election
but also the Roosevelt Se-
cond New Deal which be-
gan after 1935.
A man, nameless here,
who had served in a minor
capacity under both Pres-
idents and who had no

men had agreed to make a
joint statement denounc-
ing me.
On the advice of a friend
of Mr. Hoover, I called on
the former President at
the Waldorf. He said that
while he refrained from
expressing any opinion
about my views on the
post-election exchanges,
he respected my right to
interpret them. And con-
tinuing, he said that he
and Mr. Roosevelt had had
no contacts, directly or in-
directly, since the inaugur-
ation and that the pub-
lished story of collabora-
tion was false. Further, he
said that “I would not per-
mit anyone to smear you
through me” and that he
would communicate this
in writing to the magazine
which had recently print-
ed the story. He did so in a
letter from his confidant,
Larry Richie.

He had no reason to love
me, since I had actively
participated in his defeat
in 1932. But he was a sin-
gularly generous man of
great honor.
It was the force of great
economic circumstances
over which he had no con-
trol that shortened his
Presidency. History will
deal more kindly and
more justly with those
events. The best and most
authoritative history now
is Eugene Lyon’s biogra-
phy. It is a delineation of
what America meant in
the life of one of its finest
sons and public servants.
