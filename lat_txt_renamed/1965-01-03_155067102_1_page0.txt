Effort to Unseat Halleck as GOP
House Leader Very Badly Timed
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Unless I am mistaken, I
heard a sports announcer
say recently that 26 col-
lege and professional foot-
ball coaches have been dis-
charged since the end of
the football season. This
seems to be the penalty for
losing games. The Cleve-
land Indians baseball team
had seven managers over
a period of six years. In-
deed, there is a saying in
Cleveland that the owners
hire managers and the
fans fire them. This hu-
man manifestation has its
parallel in politics.
The great Johnson ma-
jority has placed almost
every Republican party of-
ficer in danger of losing
his position. Of course,
Goldwater has lost every-
thing he had officially and
nobody can do anything
about him. But other vic-
tims are sought out. Dean
Burch's chairmanship and
Charles Halleck's office, as
leader of the House minor-
ity are now endangered. It
is part of the game—if po-
litics is to be called a game.
*
But there are strong
considerations which sub-
stantiate Halleck's claim
to the leadership. He is a
seasoned veteran not yet
under the shadow of old
age. He was first elected to
the House in 1935 and has
remained the representa-
tive of his district ever
since. He had little Repub-
lican company back there,
for after two Roosevelt
sweeps the House Republi-
cans were reduced to a
minority of 103. (It de-
clined to 89 after 1936, the
lowest since 1893. It is now
140.) For a period, Halleck
was the only Republican
congressman elected in In-
diana. In his defense his
friends point to his long
experience, his parliamen-
tary skill, his indefatigable
labors in speaking before
GOP meetings over the na-
tion in support of party
candidates.
It is pure nonsense to
say, as some commenta-
tors have said, that the
candidacy of Gerald Ford
represents an effort by
"liberals" to unseat the
"conservative" Halleck.
Ideology has nothing to do
with this struggle. In the
Adam Stricker study of
rollcalls in the 87th Con-
gress—the last such rating
which is available—Hal-
leck is less conservative
than Ford. Two of the
leaders in the effort to
elect Ford—Charles E.
Goodell of New York and
Robert P. Griffin of Michi-
gan—have more conserva-
tive records than Halleck.
On the other hand, it is
claimed that the op-
ponents of Halleck are "ac-
tivists." It is said that they
work harder in forming al-
ternative programs in op-
position to the Democrats
and that they are younger
and more energetic. There
is something to this, but it
must be noted that the
leader of a party in a legis-
lative body is not so free to
develop and express new
ideas as is an individual
member. He must com-
promise differences in his
group and stand aloof
from contention. This
gives him the appearance
of immobility.
*
Since Halleck has been
around so long, he has
come to be regarded by
the public as representing
old and lost causes in elec-
tions. His appearance con-
veys the impression of a
Buddhist statue, but this is
a superficial matter and
should not be offered as
reason for his displace-
ment.
Another charge against
Halleck is that he has
shown lack of sympathy
for the demands of many
Republicans for more staff
members of their own par-
ty on congressional com-
mittees. There is some va-
lidity in this complaint.
For Democratic committee
members have many more
staff members to help
them in their committee
work than their Republi-
can colleagues have.
*
Halleck's response to
this is that the determina-
tion of the committee
staffs in a Congress which
is overwhelmingly Demo-
cratic is with the party in
power, and no amount of
complaint by Republicans
can bring about a better
balance. It is the conten-
tion of Halleck supporters
that considering the per-
sonal staff assistance of
members, all are well
equipped with help.
In this move for a
change in leadership, the
matter of timing should be
considered. Republican
harmony and unity can
hardly be promoted by
wholesale change in leader-
ship. The 1964 disaster
cannot be laid at the door
of Halleck, nor can it be
charged against Dean
Burch.
Perhaps after the Re-
publican Party has adjust-
ed itself, in Congress and
elsewhere, to the circum-
stances that contributed
to its defeat, there will be
time to consider the ques-
tion of leadership. But
nothing can be gained at
the moment by personal
feuds and vendettas.
