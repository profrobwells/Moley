Poverty War's Goal:
Brainwashed Society
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is a fact not generally
realized that the largest
part of the so-called anti-
poverty program consists
of federal aid and control
of education. President
Johnson throughout his
career has been a master
of finding indirect routes
to an objective when the
main highways are closed.
For more than 15 years
federal aid to education in
the primary and seconda-
ry grades has been an
issue in Congress. Pres-
idents Eisenhower, Ken-
nedy and Johnson have
given powerful support to
many schemes. But the op-
position of state and local
authorities, more recently
strengthened by private
and religion - supported
schools, has defeated the
idea in every Congress.
For there is a firmly root-
ed tradition in this country
that education shall not be
directed by a central
government in Washing-
ton.
*
But by one means or an-
other, Congress has woven
the federal net around
our public schools. In the
88th Congress 36 bills
were passed which in one
way or another projected
the federal government
into education.
The Economic Opportu-
nity Act, the "war-on-
poverty" legislation, was
vigorously opposed by Re-
publican members on the
ground that it bypassed
state and local government.
This resistance was head-
ed by Rep. Peter Freling-
huysen Jr. of New Jer-
sey, the ranking Republi-
can on the Education and
Labor Committee.
Under the act Mr. Shriv-
er has the power to impose
curricula for depressed
and segregated dropouts.
He is also able to give aid
to religious schools under
the guise of "welfare."
This raises the interesting
question whether we are
headed toward the esta-
blishment of two school
systems-one for the poor,
operated largely by feder-
al authority, and the other
for the more affluent,
operated by local and state
authority with some limit-
ed help from the federal
government.
The argument present-
ed by Frelinghuysen and
his minority colleagues
centered upon the authori-
ty vested in the Office of
Education to prescribe,
among other subjects,
courses in history and ci-
vics and also upon the au-
thority given to the Com-
missioner of Education to
make contracts with
universities to have facul-
ty members conduct "insti-
tutes" for teachers.
*
The teaching of history
and civics has a very vital
influence upon the minds
and outlook of the children
who receive it. Prior to the
early years of this century,
the history texts were fac-
tual travesties. Then there
was a change which went
too far in the other direc-
tion. In the earlier ver-
sions the Civil War was
not a conflict to save the
Union but to free the
slaves. In the more recent
socialized books, it was, as
one congressman re-
marked, a struggle based
entirely upon economics.
Both were dangerous half-
truths.
The lay public may not
realize how important
teachers' "institutes" may
be in shaping the minds of
young teachers.
*
Under the new dispen-
sation the Commissioner of
Education may select the
specific universities from
which the institute in-
structors will come. And
since the commissioner
and the Secretary of
Health, Education and
Welfare are political ap-
pointees, it is certain that
the selections of teachers
to teach teachers will con-
form to the policies of a po-
litical regime.
Thus, while opposition
to school construction aid
has been largely based on
fear that there would be
federal control of the con-
tent of education and that
opposition has succeeded
up to now, that control has
entered directly through
the back door of welfare.
