Justice Frankfurter Possessed
Great Talent in Job Placement
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the early years of
World War II, Richard
Gardiner Casey, Austra-
lian minister to the United
States, resigned to enter
the British cabinet under
Churchill. This casual step
from one nation to another
was an uncommon matter,
even in such an unusual
war. Anyhow, Casey's de-
serted superior, the prime
minister of Australia,
thought so and protested.
Casey said in his reply
that he acted on the advice
of Felix Frankfurter and
Harry Hopkins.
This interference in the
relations of two foreign
states by a Hopkins might
have passed unnoticed, for
Hopkins in those days was
one of the half dozen
people who were running
the war. But the participa-
tion of a justice of the Su-
preme Court in this affair
was astonishing.
The estimable prime mi-
nister from Down Under,
however, little knew of the
proven virtuosity over ma-
ny years of Felix Frank-
furter in job placement.

Perhaps there will be
learned articles in the law
journals on Frankfurter's
juridical philosophy dur-
ing his 25 years on the
high court. On that sub-
ject, I believe the evidence
is unclear. But Frankfur-
ter's more enduring fame
will rest upon his amazing
capacity for finding jobs
for people.
No single individual—
not even that eminent dis-
penser of patronage James
A. Farley—recruited so
many for so many official
positions in the adminis-
tration of Franklin D.
Roosevelt. In my files
covering a few of the early
years of that period, I have
a fat folder filled with
letters, telegrams, and the
records of telephone calls
from Frankfurter, all con-
taining suggestions to be
passed on to the President.
*
I am convinced that
Frankfurter served as the
decisive factor in the selec-
tion by Roosevelt of Henry
L. Stimson as secretary of
war in 1940. Frankfurter
was in a real sense the pro-
tege of Stimson, for his
first job after graduating
from the Harvard Law
School was in the office of
Stimson, who in 1906 was
U.S. district attorney in
New York.
When Stimson left that
office to run unsuccessful-
ly for governor of New
York and was appointed
secretary of war by Pres-
ident Taft, he took his fa-
vorite assistant with him
into the War Department.
From the contacts made
there, Frankfurter was
able to play a part in the
Wilson administration,
where he served as a labor
mediator on time taken off
from his professional du-
ties in the Harvard Law
School.
When Hoover became
President, Stimson was
secretary of state, and the
old relationship was re-
vived. Through Stimson,
Frankfurter placed many
of his friends in the Hoov-
er departments, especially
in State.
★
Meanwhile, he supplied
Justices Holmes and Bran-
deis with a long succession
of young law assistants,
many of whom became fa-
mous later. In the final
months of the Hoover ad-
ministration, Frankfurter
brought Stimson and Pres-
ident-elect Roosevelt
together. The result was
Roosevelt's reckless adop-
tion of the Stimson Doc-
trine, from which there
grew the roots of our
estrangement from Japan.
Frankfurter induced
Roosevelt to appoint John
Winant, a close New Eng-
land friend, as ambassa-
dor in London. This was a
bad, almost a tragic
choice.
Frankfurter's energies
extended far beyond the
government. He was a fac-
tor in the appointments of
many people to professor-
ships in law schools. And I
know of instances in
which he was effective in
the selection of newspaper
editors.
Late in the 1930s, Gen-
eral Hugh Johnson said
with a great deal of justifi-
cation that Frankfurter, a
private citizen, was the
most influential individual
in the United States.
*
As a member of the Su-
preme Court, Frankfurter
confounded his early cri-
tics. For his opinions, often
dissenting, showed more
and more a strong conser-
vative trend. The most
brilliant of these was his
last. It was his dissent in
1962 from the first reap-
portionment judgment of
the Court. There he lev-
eled an unanswerable bar-
rage of argument against
the idea that representa-
tion should be based upon
the counting of heads rath-
er than sections and inter-
ests.
Those who claim that
this meant an abandon-
ment of his early progres-
sivism may well be mista-
ken. For the progressivism
of the 1910's and 1920's
was far removed from
what is now called liberal-
ism. The La Follettes,
Borahs, and Hiram John-
sons of those days would
now be rated conservative.
In this, Frankfurter
showed a great consisten-
cy. He was a liberal in the
classical tradition through-
out a public life that
spanned nearly 60 years.
