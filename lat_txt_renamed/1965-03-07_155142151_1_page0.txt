Private Foundations Fill a Real
Need in Promoting Public Interest
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Treasury has re-
cently presented a com-
prehensive report on tax-
exempt foundations to the
Senate Finance and the
House Ways and Means
committees. This report,
which had been in the
making for more than a
year, made a number of
specific recommendations
for new legislation direct-
ed for the most part at the
financial structures and
methods of fiscal operation
of the foundations.
The report does not
touch upon the equally
controversial question of
what their income is spent
for. That subject is already
covered by law and the
many directives of the In-
ternal Revenue Service.
No doubt, the Treasury
report was prepared be-
cause of the proddings of
Rep. Wright Patman,
whose select small busi-
ness subcommittee
on foundations has been
studying the subject since
1961 and has made several
reports.
The Treasury report es-
timates that in 1962 there
were 15,000 private foun-
dations. The total assets of
these amounted to $16.3
billion, and two-thirds of
this wealth was owned by
the largest 173 of the foun-
dations.
The complaint in Pat-
man's reports embodies an
element of justice. He
points out that many of
these foundations either
own or control commercial
businesses. And thus they
enjoy competitive advan-
tages over other businesses
in the same lines.
The most important of
the Treasury's recommen-
dations is that Congress
should prohibit by law any
foundation from owning,
either directly or through
stock holdings, 20% or
more of a business. The
Treasury arrived at the
20% figure because it be-
lieved that any percentage
of ownership from 20%
upward would permit
the foundation effectively
to control the business.
An important reason for
such a limitation is that a
foundation-controlled busi-
ness has important tax ad-
vantages over competitors.
Another reason that is
just as important is that
the directors and mana-
gers of a foundation are se-
lected for quite different
reasons than are the direc-
tors and managers of a
business enterprise. The
purpose of a foundation
are quite unlike those of a
business.
Education and, in its
broadest sense, charity are
the purposes of a founda-
tion. Properly directed, its
function is to spend money
for sound and useful social
ends. On its board of direc-
tors there are usually edu-
cators, scientists, social
workers and, if its purpose
has to do with medicine
and health, doctors. There
are also businessmen on
boards, but they are there
to supply wise lay opinion.
A business concern is
designed to operate for
some useful purpose and
make a profit for owners
and stockholders. Its direc-
tors and managers are
chosen because of their
business experience.
Many foundations have
already divested them-
selves of businesses which
they wholly or substantial-
ly owned when they were
created. Moreover, the
Treasury, even without
this sort of new legislation,
has put pressure on many
foundations to give up con-
trol of businesses.
Patman, while favoring
the reforms proposed by
the Treasury, is not hap-
py. He believes that the re-
forms do not go far
enough. He favors putting
the limit of ownership in
any business at 30%. And
he wants the life of all
foundations to be limited
to 25 years.
The latter limitation, re-
jected by the Treasury, is
wholly without merit. Un-
der wise management,
and with sound objectives,
there is no good reason
why a foundation should
not live in perpetuity. We
shall always have need to
support education. And so
far as research is con-
cerned, there are no limits
to its usefulness. Despite
the Johnson war on pover-
ty, charitable activities
will always be useful in a
world of mortal and imper-
fect individuals.
In many areas of human
endeavor foundations can
never be supplanted by
government action. In-
deed, one of the most va-
luable contributions of
foundations is, to keep at
least a large proportion of
welfare and education in
private hands.
