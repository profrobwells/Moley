When It's Dead, Bury It---but the
Government Doesn't Do That!
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the high-riding frater-
nity of the Great Society
there is, as in the days of
the New Frontier, a stan-
dard dialectic. If some rea-
listic fellow comes along
with a criticism of some
uplift program or agency
of the federal govern-
ment, he is challenged in
these terms:
"Don't be against every-
thing! If you don't like the
XYZ program, what would
you substitute for it?"
My answer to this sort of
argument is this:
"Why do I have to think
up a substitute for some-
thing that made no sense
when it was established?
You are the people who
created this program. I am
not interested in finding
substitutes for nonsense."
It seems to me that the
Republicans in this Con-
gress, badly beaten last
November, shocked by in-
ternal strife, bewildered
by the tremendous packa-
ges of programs that
L.B.J. is hurling at Con-
gress, and fearful of his
present popularity, are the
victims of the administra-
tion's argument. They are
not willing to oppose.
They shrink from "me-too-
ism." They are following a
course of "just - as good-
ism."
★
Some of the programs
they are offering as substi-
tutes for Great Societyism
could be just as expensive,
just as unnecessary, and
just as unworkable. Since
Republicans are an opposi-
tion party, why not oppose
new programs that have
no merit and, while they
are at it, demand the aboli-
tion of some of the pro-
grams already feeding out
of the Treasury?
When in 1765 the
government of George III
imposed the Stamp Act,
the American colonies
raised an uproar heard
round the world. The
Rockingham Whigs, led
by the incomparable
Burke, demanded repeal.
Those friends of America
did not propose a substi-
tute. And in part because
they made their case in
England and the Ameri-
cans refused to pay, the
Grenville government fell
and the new government
abolished the Stamp Act.
Now let us consider a
prize example of federal
welfare—the Area Rede-
velopment Administration
(ARA). It was established
by Congress because a
number of liberals made
piteous outcries about
what they called "de-
pressed areas." A law was
hastily written and
passed, and a bureaucracy
was set up to spend appro-
priations.
The people who wrote
and passed the measure
were not at all clear about
the meaning of a "de-
pressed area." The job of
selection was left to the
new ARA. But no bureau
is worth its pay unless it
manages to find places to
spend its money.
A long list of depressed
areas was compiled, some
of which had never be-
lieved before that they
were depressed at all. But
in went the money, with
little discrimination about
needs or results or ac-
counting methods.
Then the watchful eye
of the Comptroller General
was turned upon this
agency, and in June, 1964,
it sent to Congress a blis-
tering report. It pointed
out that the ARA had
overestimated the number
of on-site man-months
which would be created by
190 projects by 128% and
that in 497 projects "the
50,853 on-site man-months
reported as having actual-
ly been worked were
overstated by 23,008 man-
months, or about 83%."
Nothing much hap-
pened as the result of this
audit, but the Comptroller
General hurled another
bombshell in August, 1964.
Then another critical re-
port was issued in Decem-
ber. In early January,
1965, there was another re-
port showing the same
sort of waste by the ARA,
and following this, there
was another in late Janua-
ry. On March 9th, there
was still another.
★
Thus, within a year the
supreme authority set up
to inform Congress of the
operation of the agencies it
has created has issued at
least six successive critical
reports about this agency.
For once an agency has
been created, it assumes a
certain immortality, even
when it issues misleading
reports, overstates its ac-
complishments, and fails
to keep an accounting sys-
tem which the General Ac-
counting Office can ap-
prove.
Is there any substitute
for this agency? No! It
should be abolished.
