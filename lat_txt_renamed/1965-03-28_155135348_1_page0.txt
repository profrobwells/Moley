'Consumer Class'---There Is None
The fiction that there is
a special class of Ameri-
cans who are called "con-
sumers" has survived ge-
nerations of political ho-
kum peddlers. And when-
ever anyone with intel-
ligence and common sense
has tried to find a great
divide between producers
and consumers he has end-
ed with a simple conclu-
sion. We are all consumers
and, with the exception of
people on relief, we are all
producers. Even the idle
rich draw what they
spend from some sort of
productive enterprise, be
it stocks, bonds, buildings,
or land.

Even before running for
governor, George Romney,
that charming neophyte in
politics, held forth an issue
called "consumerism."
Business as he saw it had
a primary function, to
serve its customers in the
market and non-functional
burdens would be lifted
from it. The resultant re-
duction in the costs of pro-
duction could be passed on
to the consumer, thus rais-
ing his real income.
The Kennedy campaign
in 1960 latched on to the
idea of doing something
for the consumer. The
New Frontier "implement-
ed" this into a social-work-
er operation with a new
bureaucracy to care for
the "poor fool" who could
not care for his money.
Liberals forgot that Ki-
pling said that forever
"The burned fool's ban-
daged finger goes wob-
bling back to the fire."
President Johnson has
appointed a special assist-
ant for consumer affairs.
But so far, her efforts have
followed the bureaucratic
channel: conferences be-
tween government and
business, with "profession-
al consumers" to lecture
those who attend.
The moment any prob-
lem, real or imagined,
comes to the mind of a sen-
ator or congressman he in-
troduces a bill to create a
new bureau or department
or commission. When the
bill is enacted, the new
bureau must find, first,
what the alleged problem
is or is not; second, where
the problem is located,
and, third, how to spend
money to solve it.
Sen. Philip A. Hart of
Michigan has also discov-
ered the consumer, and
his bill would set up an in-
dependent Office of Consu-
mers.
*
Rep. Benjamin S.
Rosenthal followed by in-
troducing a bill in the
House, identical with
Hart's. The congressman
said in submitting his bill:
"Increasingly, the citiz-
en's role as a consumer is
matching the importance
of his role as a producer.
Last year consumer pur-
chases amounted to nearly
two-thirds of our gross na-
tional product."
This, I submit, should
receive the gold medal for
the most ridiculous com-
ment of the year.
Using the GNP figure as
a guide to consumer in-
fluence betrays a gross
misunderstanding of what
that figure is and how it is
calculated. For the term it-
self, however unreliable it
is to determine anything,
is designed to be an ex-
pression of production.
Where there is a buyer,
there is a seller, and
where there is a consu-
mer, there is a producer.
And every producer is also
a consumer in an endless
series of transactions.
Far back when modern
liberalism emerged from
the school of Progressi-
vism—which, in turn, was
the progeny of Populism—
there was talk and action
about consumers. There
was a Consumer's League,
a screen for a variety of
socialistic nostrums.

In 1933 the NRA had a
consumer division, and a
busy woman whom I
knew was its director. It
never succeeded in isolat-
ing the object of its minis-
trations.
There is and must be
government machinery to
protect a person from
fraud, from cheating, from
dangers that lurk in food
and drugs. This is what
government police power
is for. It is to see that ras-
cals don't cheat people,
and when they do, that
they shall be punished.
Legislation and courts
were created for this sort
of policing. But we mangle
all meaning when we
speak of a class of consum-
ers.
