Ray Bliss Is One Ohioan Who
Certainly Shouldn't Be Underrated
BY RAYMOND. MOLEY
As a native of Ohio
whose acquaintance with
that state is extensive, I
have always strongly re-
sented the disdain often
bordering on contempt
which is manifested by
most Washington pundits
for the statesmen and poli-
tical leaders who coma
from Ohio to the nation's
capital. That intellectual
sncbbery is shared by opi-
nion-makers in New York
as well.
Ray C. Bliss, who was
installed as Republican
National Chairman on
April 1st, is the latest..
Ohioan to attain high sta-
tus in national affairs. His
selection was generally ac-
claimed because of his so-
lid merit as a political or-
ganizer. But the time may
come when the pundits
will complain about him.
For he comes from Ohio,
and it's a fashionable exer-
cise to underrate Ohioans.
Bliss makes no claim to
eminence as an orator or
molder of party policy.
His genius—and it is ge-
nius—is in organization,
the like of which has not
been seen in our time. And
he. has accepted this diffi-
cult post at a moment
when Republican pros-
pects are as dim as they
have been for half a centu-
ry.
*
In his inaugural speech
when he assumed the Re-
publican chairmanship,
Bliss offered a body of
common sense which not
only Republicans but all
Americans might well
ponder.
He pointed out: "Let
there be no mistake about
it ..the present weak-
ness of the Republican
Party is not simply a prob-
lem for Republicans. It is a
national problem... For
the United States cannot
afford to have either of its
parties weak or disinter-
ested, discouraged or un-
responsive to the needs of
its citizens."
This suggests what
Burke said of an opposi-
tion party: "Even if they
were not called to office,
the Rockinghams in oppo-
sition served England, a
body of men 'sacrificing
ambition to principle, can
never be without use.""
At the moment, Lyndon
B. Johnson is riding so
high that many of those
who contemplate the enor-
mity of his program and
the slavish obedience of
Congress to his wishes
have no hope that our in-
stitutions can survive the
onslaught. Measures pro-
posed by the Kennedy ad-
ministration which in a
better balanced Congress
failed because of their de-
fects, are now slapped
through in a matter of
weeks or days. A shocking
euphoria possesses both
the congressional majority
and the executive. What
with handouts for every-
body and changes in vot-
ing laws and in the repre-
sentative institutions of
the states, many thought-
ful people wonder whe-
ther we can ever return to
a balanced two-party sys-
tem.
It is at such a moment as
this that an opposition is
most needed. And it is this
opposition that Ray Bliss
intends to mobilize at the
level of the precincts, the
counties, and the states.
• It is best for all Republi-
cans to put ideological con-
siderations in second place
until after the 1966 elec-
tions. What is needed most
in the 18 months before
those elections is to build
Republican strength at lo-
cal and state levels in or-
der to return to office the
congressmen who lost by
small margins in 1964, re-
cover control of legisla-
tures which were swept
by Democrats, and return
good Republican county
officials to office. Then in
1968 the ideological differ-
ences that rent the GOP
last year can be taken up
and presumably resolved,
and the party can move on
in confidence to the Pres-
idential election..
All this will require or-
ganized effort. That is
where Ray Bliss has no
peer.
