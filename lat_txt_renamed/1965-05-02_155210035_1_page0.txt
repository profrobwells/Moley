Bayh Amendment on Presidential
Disability Mixes Good With Bad
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The constitutional
amendment sponsored by
Sen. Birch Bayh, dealing
with Presidential disabili-
ty and passed by the Sen-
ate 70-0, has five sections.
Two sections are good and
one of those is highly de-
sirable. The third is unne-
cessary, and the fourth
and fifth are unworkable
if not dangerous. Let us
consider these sections se-
parately.
Section 1 provides sim-
ply that in case of the re-
moval of the President, the
Vice President shall be-
come President. This is de-
sirable because under the
wording of the Constitu-
tion, Vice Presidents who
have taken over after the
deaths of Presidents have
been Acting Presidents.
The provision clears up
that slight matter of offi-
cial title.
Section 2 is highly desir-
able because it would per-
mit a Vice President who
becomes President to nom-
inate a new Vice President
who would assume that of-
fice after confirmation by
Congress.
Section 3 says that when
a President tells Congress
that he is unable to dis-
charge the powers and du-
ties of his office, such pow-
ers and duties shall be dis-
charged by the Vice Pres-
ident as Acting President.
This, it seems to me, is un-
necessary because if he
could do that now and, if it
seemed necessary, Con-
gress could immediately
validate this declaration.
Sections 4 and 5 consti-
tute an effort by Congress
to provide a way to deter-
mine Presidential disabili-
ty when the President is
unwilling or unable to
make such a declaration
himself. Section 4 says
that such a determination
of disability can be made
whenever the Vice Pres-
ident and a majority of the
principal officers of the ex-
ecutive departments, "or
such other body" as Con-
gress may by law provide,
transmit to Congress such
a declaration. The Vice
President shall then imme-
diately assume the powers
and duties of the office as
Acting President.
The Senate in adopting
this proposed amendment
is clearly evading its re-
sponsibility, for it is put-
ting off for some future
time the decision as to
what "other body" shall
determine Presidential in-
capacity. Considering that
Congress has the authority
now to decide this, should
it not face up to its respon-
sibility at once?
The real heart of the
matter is in this question
of who shall determine
Presidential incapacity. It
should have been clear to
the Senators who voted for
the amendment that histo-
ry, especially in 1919-1921
when Wilson was incapa-
citated, has shown that it
is wholly unlikely that any
Vice President along with
a majority of the members
of the Cabinet would or
could in fact make such a
declaration.
*
There are cases other
than that of Wilson when
Presidents have been inca-
pacitated and either by
their own volition or
through their immediate
advisers still held all the
power of the office.
President Cleveland
was secretly operated
upon for a cancerous con-
dition of the jaw. This nor-
mally would mean incapa-
city at least for the period
of convalescence, but the
country was kept in the
dark.
When President Eisen-
hower had his heart at-
tack, he was unable by
any medical judgment to
carry on the duties of his
office. Sherman Adams
took over, and Vice Pres-
ident Nixon was relegated
to the outskirts of the
Adams sphere.
Section 5 of the Bayh
amendment provides that
when the President tells
Congress that his inability
has passed, he shall re-
sume the duties of the of-
fice, unless the officials
mentioned in Section 4
shall within seven days
transmit to Congress their
declaration that the Pres-
ident is still unable to
serve. In that case, Con-
gress shall decide the
issue. If it is determined,
by a two-thirds vote of both
houses, that the President
is unable to function, the
Vice President shall con-
tinue as Acting President.
It has been suggested
that Congress could, with-
out a constitutional
amendment, impose upon
the Supreme Court the re-
sponsibility for determin-
ing a President's incapaci-
ty. In such a case, the Su-
preme Court might well
refuse to accept the re-
sponsibility. However, if
any constitutional amend-
ment is going to be enact-
ed, this responsibility
could be imposed upon the
Court and the Court could
not escape it.
This, it seems to me,
would have been the
direct and logical way in
which this question could
be resolved.
