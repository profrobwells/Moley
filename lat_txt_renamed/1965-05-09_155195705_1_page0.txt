What Have We---Consensus or
Dictatorship by Common Consent?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
"Who Put the Con in
Consensus?" is the title
given this year to a satiri-
cal show produced annual-
ly by the Cleveland City
Club. It will be the 32nd
annual show, and it is
most remarkable that 5l of
the scripts have been writ-
ten by a beloved Clevelan-
der, Judge Carl D. Friebo-
lin.
Age has not withered
Friebolin's thought - pro-
voking humor. He is 87.
The City Club's annual
"Anvil Revue" is a sharp
spoof about political af-
fairs at all levels.

Presumably the chief
subject to be hammered
on this year will be
the Johnson Great Society
and the President's claim
that his program repre-
sents a national "consen-
sus."
I borrow the title to exа-
mine this concept of "con-
sensus" which L.B..J. uses
as the justification of the
luge program of domestic
handouts which with rith-
less abandon and little con-
cern for consequences is
being enacted into law by
siavishly obedient con-
gressional majority.
When the President als
about having a "consen-
sus" for what he wants, he
is assuming that the large
majority he received in
November justifies the use
of the expression. He as-
sumes that a consensus is
something that can be
identified on mathematical
grounds. This. I hope to
show, is not true.

The expression "consen-
sus" is derived from a ve-
ry old constitutional con-
cept, "the consent of the
governed." This I have de-
fined on another occasion,
and in line with the usage
of the great classical ex-
ponents of political philo-
sophy, as follows:
"Majority 'rule' is not m
fact a principle of our Con-
stitution, for a majority
does not rule. It governs.
in the long history of the
common law, consent is
not valid when it is given
under duress, physical or
political, It is not valid if
obtained under the cover
of false representations. It
is not valid when it is ob-
tained by bribery in any
form. And I cannot believe
to be consent when a
people submit because
they can find no way to
refuse.
"Consent is then when
those involved freely,
knowingly, willingly, and
with a part in making the
situation, enter into the
benefits and responsibili-
ties of the decision."
Prohibition is our best
recent example of an en-
actment which conformed
with the mathematical for-
mula stated above. The
18th Amendment was
properly passed with the
vote of two-thirds of Con-
gress and three-fourths of
the states. Four Presidents
who swore to uphold it
were elected by large ma-
jorities. Roosevelt did not
openly oppose it when he
ran against Hoover. But it
failed because there was
no consent.
At the present time
there is nothing that could
be called a consensus on
the major legislative "vic-
tories" of the President.
Many states are flatly op-
posed to major features of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
There is sizable oposi-
tion to the tricky provi-
sions of the education bill
just passed. A high prelate
of the Catholic Church will
claims that the bill dis-
minate against children
in parochial schools. Pro-
testants in great numbers
oppose even the pittance
given to private schools.
Most of the medical
profession, the insurance
companies, and a great
number of citizens, old and
young, oppose the medi-
care bill. The voting rights
bill horrifies many consti-
tutional lawyers and pro-
bably a third of the states.

The "mandate" given
Candidate Johnson was
more in opposition to Gold-
water than approval of the
L.B.J. programs.
Moreover, opposition
which will grow will
prove that no consensus is
possible for the detailed
measures now being en-
acted.
To claim a consensus be-
hind the Johnson Adminis-
tration is to negate and
scrap the concept of two-
party government. For it
means that we have in
Washington today a dicta-
torship by common con-
sent.
