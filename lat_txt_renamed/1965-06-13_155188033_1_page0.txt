Review Board Proposal Strikes
at Heart of New York's 'Finest'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A current objective of
the civil rights agitation in
New York City is the crea-
tion of what is called a "ci-
vilian review board" to ar-
raign any policeman who
is accused of what some
choose to call "brutality."
One of its sponsors is J.
Raymond Jones of Har-
lem, who wears two hats.
He is a city councilman
and is also the head of the
Manhattan Democracy,
formerly known as Tam-
many Hall. In the Demo-
cratic Assembly in Al-
bany, which would have to
pass on the measure, is an-
other sponsor, Assembly-
man Mark T. Southall, al-
so of Harlem.
*
The proposal is that
there be created a nine-
member Independent Ci-
tizens' Complaint Review
Board with wide powers
to hold hearings, compel
testimony under oath and
make recommendations to
the city government. This
board would recommend
to the mayor whether pen-
alties should be loss of pay,
departmental reprimands
or letters of apology to ag-
grieved persons. It could
also recommend legisla-
tion to the mayor.
Presumably, these
"trials" would be public,
with all the embarrass-
ment to the accused police-
man and his family and
friends which such ran-
dom accusations might in-
volve. Mayor Wagner has
been silent about this pro-
posal. But his police com-
missioner, Michael J. Mur-
phy, resigned after strong-
ly denouncing the plan.
Murphy denied that this
new attack on the police
was the reason for his re-
signation, but it is clear
that the long ordeal of deal-
ing with demonstrations
and attacks upon police
brought him to a state of
weariness in which he pre-
ferred a position in private
life.
This issue is only one of
the many manifestations
of the civil rights move-
ment which seems to have
taken a heavy toll from
the responsible heads of
government in New York.
The mayor recently ex-
pressed a desire to retire
at the end of his present
term the end of this year.
The superintendent of
schools, after long wran-
gling with the board of
education, has been offici-
ally removed from the du-
ties of his office but is hol-
ding onto his title and con-
tract. His case is in the
courts.
Useful and experienced
police administrators are
seeking retirement when
their pensions are due.
And throughout the force,
proudly known as "the
finest," morale is sinking
at a rapid rate. Reports
are frequently in the news
that when an arrest is
made mobs assail the po-
lice, and even the most va-
liant efforts to suppress
crime and delinquency
seem to fail.
*
Despite an occasional
scandal, the New York Ci-
ty police system is the best
in the world. The police
commissioners, even un-
der the rather indifferent
administration of Mayor
Wagner, have been out-
standing. For many years
the force has been relieved
of the old Tammany con-
trol. It must handle vast
responsibilities, from
protecting such unsavory
visitors as Khrushchev
and Castro to Negro
demonstrations and the
scourge of roving gangs of
hoodlums.
It is, like all good police
forces, a real professional
association. It respects its
duly constituted superiors,
the mayor and the com-
missioner. It has built-in
instrumentalities for in-
force discipline and tradi-
tions of behavior handed
down from generation to
generation. Many mem-
bers of the force are sons
and grandsons of police-
men.
To thrust a civilian
board of complaint into
this force, which would be
regarded as alien to the
service, would strike at
the very vitals of its mo-
rale. Policemen would de-
cide that the best way
when emergency strikes is
to play safe. For no one
wants the obloquy of a for-
mal hearing on charges
which may be wholly
without responsible foun-
dation.
The courts are open to
those who have griev-
ances, if an appeal to the
commissioner and mayor
fail. If civil disobedience is
to be proclaimed by people
who are crying out at the
same time for justice, then
disobedience to the law
will become the rule rath-
er than the exception.
