Russia Wheat Sale Farce Proving
Expensive Entertainment for U.S.
When Messrs. Schlesinger and Sorensen get
around to it in their premature memoirs, I wish
they would tell us who
was advising John F. Kennedy when he announced
the wheat deal with Russia on Oct. 9, 1963. For the
President, as the son of a
highly successful business
operator, made probably
the worst business deal
since the Dutch were foolish enough to buy New
York from the Indians.
The descent from the
high plateau of conditions
made by our government
is amusing enough, although it was costly entertainment for our taxpayers.

President Kennedy said
that the sales of wheat
would be carried out by
private American dealers
for American dollars or
gold under normal commercial credit terms. But
the banks balked, and
Lyndon Johnson had to
twist the arms of Congress
to provide credit from the
government.
President Kennedy said
the deal would help the
American taxpayer. But
after having subsidized
the wheat at home, we had
to add to the subsidy $7
million in freight in order
to get the Russians to hire
some of our ships.
The biggest joke in the
whole transaction was the
President's promise that
all the stuff would be carried in American ships
and thus provide employment for American seamen. There weren't
enough such ships available, and so we climbed
down to 50%. The maritime unions grumbled, and
the Commerce Department set "guideline" rates
so low that American ship-
owners, who have plenty
of headaches making a living, used their ships for
more profitable business
than in feeding the Russians. Only about a third of

the grain was finally carried under U.S. Flag.
Now the Soviet Union is
again shopping for wheat.
The Soviet wheat crop,
which had promised to
match the good harvest of
last year, has been hit by
weather. Besides, grain
has apparently been
diverted into the fattening
of livestock.
The London Economist
has noted that "it is now
roughly twice as profitable
for a collective farm to
stuff a ton of grain into
pigs as into a government
procurement bin. And
Russian farmers are as
adept as their western colleagues in doing their
sums — and acting on
them." As a result, it is estimated that the Russians
will sell $450 million in
gold for this season's grain
buying, and there are also
the huge purchases by
Red China of wheat from
Canada.
We have wheat galore,
but we haven't made up
our minds about doing
business with the Russians. Surely, however, after their previous experience in buying from
Americans, the Russians
will seek grain every-
Moley
where before trying us
again. Nevertheless, the
congressmen and senators
from the farm states,
along with Vice President
Humphrey, are trying to
get rid of the order by
which 50% of wheat sales
to Russians must go in
U.S.-Flag ships.
The maritime unions
loudly demand their percentage and say that, without it, they will—to belabor a word—strike. Secretary Rusk denied that the
President has any intention of selling grain to Russia. And some lonesome
voices are raised in Congress to say that it will be
quite difficult to ask our
allies not to ship supplies
to the Viet Cong if we are
going to fall all over ourselves to garner some of
those Russian bucks.

It was through an executive order that the 50-50
provision was applied to
the Kennedy Russian
wheat deal—an outlandish
requirement in a "commercial" transaction. The
taxpayers do foot the bill
for higher rates charged
by otherwise unsubsidized
U.S. ships carrying 50% of
government-financed cargoes.
Maritime administrator
Nicholas Johnson has emphasized that as a subsidy
such cargo-preference has
been a miserable failure
and that not a single new
tramp ship has been built
since 1956. The cost to the
taxpayers is $80 million
annually.
There are only 131 dry-
cargo tramps remaining in
the active fleet. Of these,
33 are currently under
charter to companies for liner service, and 25 are under charter to the Military
Sea Transportation Service.
That leaves only 73, plus
some grain-carrying tankers, for a portion of
foreign-aid grain commitments that go over the
world in U.S. ships and for
the steadily rising demands of supplying Vietnam. Military needs have
already called at least 47
ships from the government reserve fleet, and
over this emergency buildup there looms a shortage
of personnel.
We could not carry
more than a few bushels of
wheat to the Russians if
we wanted to.
