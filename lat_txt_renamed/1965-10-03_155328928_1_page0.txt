Slash in Rules Committee's Power
Departure From Jefferson's Rule
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a legislative body
there is always a peril to
the rights of individuals
and to minorities from an
unrestrained majority.
And the bigger the majority,
the greater the peril.
This observation applies
with special emphasis to
what has happened in the
present session in the
House of Representatives
elected in the great sweep
of 1964.
An illustration of this is
what has happened to the
rules and procedures in
the House. For that body,
rather than the Senate,
has in past years been the
major means of restraint
and deliberation.
Everyone remembers
the great fight in 1961 over
the "packing" or "enlarge-
ment" of the Rules Committee.
Irritated by the exercise of
their powers by
Chairman Smith and his
majority in the committee,
President Kennedy and
his liberal friends in the
House secured the addition
of two liberal Democratic
members to the
Rules Committee. The
vote on that was narrow,
217 to 212. But the Kennedy
program lagged, because
in so large a body as
the House it was necessary
to have a means for reviewing
the innumerable
bills passed on by the various
committees before
they were brought to the
floor for debate and a vote.
With Mr. Johnson, who
possesses much greater influence
in Congress than
his predecessor, there
developed a compulsive
drive to pass what was left
from the Kennedy years
and to add a considerable
number of new programs.
And so his friends proposed
two changes in the
rules of the House which
virtually gave Speaker
McCormick much of the
power formerly exercised
by the Rules Committee.
In January these changes
in the rules were
passed by a vote of 224 to
201. It is very significant
that these changes would
have been defeated except
for the defection of 16 Republican
members. That
party bolt could not have
happened except for three
factors â€” the diminished
Republican minority in
the House, the fight in the
Republican minority over
the leadership and the
deep fissure in the Republican
Party over the nation
after the convention of July
1964.
At any rate, that defection
by Republicans has
permitted a profoundly
important change in the
balance between the executive
and legislative
branches of our government.
Under the revised rules,
Speaker McCormick has
the authority to bring any
bill to the floor, for debate
and a vote, which has been
adversely reported by the
Rules Committee or which
the Rules Committee has
failed to act upon within
21 days after the bill's referral
to the Rules Committee.
In actual practice, during
this session the speaker
has scheduled bills for
floor action so soon after
their referral that the
Rules Committee has simply
not had the time to
read or consider them.
The 1961 enlargement of
the Rules Committee
meant a great increase in
the power of the speaker.
This new change has given
the speaker almost dictatorial
power over legislation.
And since McCormick is responsive
to the
President's wishes, the
President can get almost
anything he wants from
the House with little debate
or deliberation.
The result will be not
only an overriding of the
constitutional division between
the executive and
legislative branches of
government, but the hasty
passage of bills the defects
of which time will most
certainly reveal.
The House of Representatives
is a very large and
cumbersome body. Even
when it had only 142 members,
Jefferson wrote in
his Manual of Parliamentary
Practice in 1801:
"It is much more material
that there should be a
rule to go by than what
that rule is; that there may
be a uniformity of proceeding
in business not subject
to the caprice of the
Speaker or captiousness of
the members."
This a warning that the
present Democratic Party
in the House has ignored
in giving the speaker such
dictatorial power. And this
was the Jefferson who in
every convention of that
party has been hailed as
its founder and guiding
spirit.
