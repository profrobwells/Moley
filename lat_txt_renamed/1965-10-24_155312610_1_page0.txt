New York City, despite
its resplendence and interest, is really a very sick
city. And the three doctors
who, as candidates for
mayor, are seeking a post
at the bedside are making
charges and claims that
have little to do with the
patient's recovery.

The leading candidate
at this moment, Democrat
Abraham Beame, is telling
a long-suffering citizenry
that things are not so bad
as the critics say they are.
He prefers to tell us what
is right about New York.

John V. Lindsay, who
seeks the support which
elected the late Fiorello La
Guardia three times, has
had the La Guardia words
but not the tune—the passionate righteousness in
the Little Flower's campaigns which was the
promise of indefatigable
activity as mayor.

And William F. Buckley
Jr. is interesting but is
aiming at an objective that
has little relevance to the
necessity of doing something to arrest the decline
of the great city.

What we are seeing and
hearing in this campaign
has little promise for the
people who must live,
raise their children and
carry on their work,
professions or businesses
here in the years to come.
What is really wrong with
New York is long-continued neglect of the basic
needs of people who must
live in its huddled confines. That neglect has
centered in its government, at the head of which
is the mayor.

Space permits only one
example of this neglect.
But it is characteristic of
many other areas of municipal concern. There is a
water shortage which may
grow worse in the months
to come. When we had a
water scare several years
ago, the city decided to tap
the Hudson River 60 or 70
miles upstream. But after
the scare ended, the facilities under way there were
scrapped.

And now, during this
year’s shortage, water
mains are bursting and
leaking all over town. The
fact is that the water
mains and the sewers are
in considerable part in decay, for many were built
in the Tweed days a century ago.

Transportation, law enforcement, traffic, education and street cleaning
are bad and getting worse.
Business is leaving the city, and thousands of solid,
middle-income people are
moving out beyond the city limits.

Little can be expected
from the election of
Beame. It will be more of
the same.

When Republican Congressman Lindsay entered
the contest a few months
ago there was great hope
that he might be elected
and that there would be a
change, however temporary. But he has been beset
by certain miscalculations
as well as by some circumstances beyond his control.
History shows that nothing but a big, juicy scandal
can unseat a Democratic
administration in New
York City.

There has been no such
scandal. The trouble is not
one shocking incident. It is
the accumulation of many
deficiencies and many neglects, and that has not
shaken the apathy of New
Yorkers. They have accepted sloppy government
as a way of life.

While Lindsay’s repudiation of the Goldwater
candidacy was his right
and privilege, it was unfortunate in its present
bearing on his candidacy
for mayor. For despite a
nationally held belief,
there are some Republicans in New York City.
Last year 802,000 voted for
Goldwater. And so Lindsay’s party “apostasy” and
his many votes in Congress in support of Democratic proposals are being
vigorously rubbed in by
Buckley. A considerable
part of Buckley’s Conservative Party vote is expected to be drawn from
alienated Republicans as
well as from a great many
conservative Democrats.

Lindsay entered the
contest too soon. When he
announced his candidacy,
he expected to run against
Mayor Robert Wagner.
But when Wagner decided
to retire and the mayor’s
man was defeated in the
primary by Beame, it became necessary to shift
the Lindsay attack.

More recently, the stinging rhetoric of Buckley
and some unfavorable
polls turned Lindsay away
from the main issue into
an attack upon the Conservative candidate. He
would have been wise to
ignore Buckley.

Buckley is provocative
but diverting. His major
appeal is, after all, remote
from the problems of New
York City. He is trying to
prove that a show of conservative strength in New
York will cause legislators
at the state and national
level to stand more firmly
against liberal policies and
legislation.

That is a desirable end,
but the present necessity
is to get better government for the hapless population of New York City.
