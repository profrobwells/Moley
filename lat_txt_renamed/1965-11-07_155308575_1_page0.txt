Play Now---Pay Later Is Unwise
for an Individual or for a Nation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the first session of
the 89th Congress fades in-
to history, It reminds me of
a man in New York who
had a big afternoon and
night on the town. That
man, who recklessly spent
on his credit, realized
when the bills came in
that he was not only una-
ble to remember what he
had "bought," but was so
loaded with debt that his
obligations would haunt
him for a long time to
come.
The President has ac-
claimed the session as "the
greatest in American his-
tory." But his use of the
word "greatest" means the
most expensive and the
most reckless.
The New Yorker to
whom I refer was one of
the best paid and best
known figures on Madison
Ave. On the morning of
the night out he had re-
ceived a new and better
employment contract with
his company. He had a
home with wife and kid-
dies in Westchester. He
had charge accounts at the
better stores, and his wal-
let was crammed with cre-
dit cards of all sorts.
*
The spending part of his
day began at noon, when
he entertained three asso-
ciates in his company: Af-
ter the familiar three mar-
tinis before lunch, his feel-
ing of good will rose so
high that in the early af-
ternoon he proceeded to
several stores and charged
presents for his family and
other relatives.
At 5:30 he met some
friends at a bar for the
usual two or three "for the
road." Meanwhile the com-
muter train departed and
he called home and said
that "business" would
keep him in town for the
evening. Then he and his
friends began the rounds.
He ended by taking a
room for the night at an
expensive hotel. In addi-
tion to his outlays on cre-
dit, there was a certain
amount of cash paid out
for taxis and tips.
The next day, if his
mind considered costs at
all, he had not the faintest
idea of the extent of his ob-
ligations. The bills would
come staggering in for
three or four weeks.
Congress at this 1965
session appropriated $119
billion, which was $12 bil-
lion more than in 1964, but
this is only the official fl-
gure. Many welfare pro-
grams that were adopted
are of the open-end varie-
ty. Some of the legislation
imposes obligations of an
indeterminate nature for
years to come. Some in-
volves back-door spending,
in which money will be
drawn from the Treasury
without annual appropria-
tion.
In the final catch-all
supplemental money mea-
sures approved just prior
to adjournment, Congress
acted to provide advance
funding for the urban re-
newal program. No one
knows what the future
costs of hospital and nurs-
ing-home care will be, for
no one can predict how
many will claim the bene-
fits. The costs of education
are unknown, for no one
knows how many indivi-
duals and institutions will
claim grants under a rath-
er fuzzy authorization.
*
What we do know is
that federal welfare expen-
ditures leaped in the 10
years from 1955 to 1965
from $13 billion to $33 bil-
lion, and under the laws
passed this year the wel-
fare costs will probably go
up to around $45 billion by
1970. This comes very
close to the outlays for the
military and for foreign
aid.
But while in this coun-
try we have been moving
into the welfare state, fol-
lowing the United King-
dom in the early years af-
ter World War II, the
United Kingdom is now
discovering a serious drift
in public opinion in the
other direction. A poll by
the British Institute of
Public Affairs shows that
the costly social-service
programs over there are
rapidly losing their popu-
larity. In the United King-
dom two-fifths of the gov-
ernment's revenue goes to
these services.
*
The present Labor
Government now finds
that these outlays are im-
pairing the nation's cur-
rency in foreign markets.
This in any nation mea-
sures the ultimate reckon-
ing. At the recent British
Labor Party's conference
at Blackpool the more con-
servative elements in the
dominant party sharply
rebuffed the orthodox so-
cialists.
This is in contrast with
the United States, where
the liberal element over-
whelmingly swept the
elections in 1964. At this
moment in the United
States government welfare
is at a high tide. We are
enjoying our spree now.
The inevitable bills will
come in later.
