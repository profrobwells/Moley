Government's Aluminum Action
Raises Fears for Free Market

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Now that there prevails
in the aluminum affair
what President Johnson
calls a "consensus," a
number of sober reflections
are in order. But first
it is necessary to explain
what Mr. Johnson means
when he uses the word
"consensus."

In plain English, what
he means is a condition in
which opposition has
agreed with him, despite
its own doubts and
protests. You have consensus when you permit the
President to have his own
way.

There is peace because
superior power prevails.
There is agreement because disagreement is impossible. There is calm because the opposition has
lost the capacity or willingness to fight.

The rationale given by
the Johnson administration for forcing the aluminum industry to rescind
a price rise was that it
was trying to prevent inflation. There was a great
deal of cleverness in thus
placing the blame on
business for price rises generally, for this takes the
onus from government,
which is the real source of
inflation.

The government has a
monopoly in the manufacture of money, and everyone knows that inflation
prevails when the supply
of money rises faster than
the production of goods.
The real reason why prices are rising in almost every part of our economy is
that the government,
through its huge deficits,
is manufacturing money
at a tremendous rate.

Public resentment at this
government-sponsored inflation will ultimately be
felt. What the Johnson administration has been doing by its immense
spending programs is to
give everyone a fine stimulant for the time being.
But later on, when voters
begin to calculate what
they are getting for their
cheap supply of money,
grave political dangers
will hover over the administration and the members of Congress who have
contributed to the spree.
Mr. Johnson apparently
hopes to fend off blame by
placing the responsibility
for inflation upon business. It is just as simple as
that.

Put in the simplest of
terms, there are two major
factors in a price: the labor
cost and the amount taken
from income in profits. In
the case of aluminum, the
government made no
protest when the companies agreed with the labor
unions to a larger outlay
in wages and benefits. In
that restraint, as well as in
its efforts to amend the
Taft-Hartley Act, the
Johnson administration
was responding to the
claims of the unions following their political support in 1964.

Prices in a free market
are normally determined
by competition and by supply and demand. When
there is evidence of collusion among companies in
an industry to keep prices
artificially high, the government has plenty of
tools to prosecute under
the anti-trust laws. But
there was no such claim in
the aluminum case. The
several large companies
have apparently been innocent of such collusion.
So the government announced it would dump a
great part of its stockpile
into the market.

But how can a fair price
be determined when the
government itself is by all
odds the biggest customer?
The normal action of a
free market ceases to operate. The government pays
what it decides is a fair
price, and for economic or
patriotic reasons the suppliers acquiesce. All estimates of fairness become
irrelevant.

It must be noted that
competition which faces
the aluminum industry is
not merely among companies producing the white
metal. Major competition
comes from steel and other
substitutes. In the past,
aluminum took a considerable part of its market
from steel. But steel is lying in wait to get that business back, and if the aluminum producers raise
prices to excessive heights
this again is a restraint
which acts as a protection
for the public.

Finally, it must be remembered that the
government itself stimulated the aluminum industry by accumulating its
huge stockpile. This placed in the hands of
government a tremendous
weapon. The outcome of
this affair may well cause
a shudder to pass through
other industries where
stockpiles exist. For we
have reached a point at
which price fixing by
government is achieved
not by law but by massive
economic force.
