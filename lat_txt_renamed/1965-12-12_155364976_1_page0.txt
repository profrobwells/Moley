'New' Economics Isn't New and Is
Getting Into the Same Old Trouble
The "new" economics,
conceived in the Kennedy
years, built into a formida-
ble theory by various
wordsmiths in the White
House and imposed upon
the Treasury by Presiden-
tial pressure, seems to be
in trouble. For the mea-
sures adopted in its name,
such as wholesale tax cuts,
immense spending pro-
grams and calculated con-
tinuing deficits, are pro-
ducing exactly what we
were assured would not
happen-inflation.
Perhaps I should not say
that the economic seers in
the Kennedy years gua-
ranteed that there would
be no inflation. All they
said was that we wouldn't
feel it because we would
all be so very prosperous.

In an issue of the Tax
Review, published by a re-
liable research agency, the
Tax Foundation, Arthur
1. Burns, formerly chair-
man of President Eisen-
hower's Council of Econ-
omic Advisers, defines the
"new" economies as "the
deliberate adoption of
budgetary deficits without
regard to their duration
as long as a gap exist-
ed between the nation's ac-
tual production and theo-
reucany what it could pro-
duce if unemployment did
not exceed 4%."
Another former chair-
man of the Eisenhower
Council of Economic Advi-
sers, Raymond J. Saulnier,
gives a shorter definition:
"fiscal and monetary ex-
pansionism."
Summed up in less tech-
nical terms, the "new"
economics means that we
can have prosperity if we
manufacture enough mo-
ney. And the money spent
or invested will bring
enough production so that,
even with lower tax rates,
we can get all the money
back again. But when we
get it back. we don't pay
the federal and private
debts caused by the defi-
cits. We manufacture

more money with more de-
ficits and keep the wheels
spinning indefinitely, or
maybe forever.
This idea isn't new at
all. France was at it nearly
two centuries ago. In the
United States it had its
great fling in Populism,
which reached its climax
in the half-baked preach-
ing of William Jennings
Bryan.
The only difference is
that the multiplication of
money and credit is at-
tained by different meth-
ods. And now it is embel-
lished with a lot of brand
new words and phrases.
In Arthur Schlesinger's
book, "A Thousand Days,"
we have a vivid account of
the revival of Populism in
the White House in 1961,
1962 and 1963. Not only is
Schlesinger a devotee of
the "new" economics, but
he supplies a whole pack-
age of jargon to explain it.
He says that when he
and the palace guard were
giving John F. Kennedy
lessons in economics there
were two schools of ex-
Moley
ponents, the "structural"
and the "fiscal" people.
The "structuralists," as
he calls them, believed in
putting through a lot of ex-
pensive programs and get-
ting the money for them
by deficits and thus by
monetary expansion. The
"fiscalists" believed in put-
ting out more money re-
gardless, even by cutting
taxes.
Schlesinger says there
weren't any "pure" struc-
turalists or fiscalists. We
can understand that, be-
cause both were for a
great deal of spending.
But the structuralists be-
lieved the government
should get the money and
spend it itself. The fisca-
lists believed that if taxes
were cut, the people would
spend it.
Thus, both roads started
with deficits, and both
would end in general infla-
tion. Prof. J. Kenneth Gal-
braith was a structuralist
in the administration be-
cause he believed that if
the people had more mo-
ney they wouldn't have
enough sense to spend it
properly. Only the
bureaucracy had the saga-
city to spend intelligently.

But while Mr. Kennedy
sent a great many pro-
grams for federal spend-
ing to Congress, he
couldn't get them through.
And so he deserted the
structuralists and went
with the fiscalists and pro-
posed a tax cut. This was
easier for Congress to take.
Also, it went fairly well
with business.
Then came President
Johnson, who grabbed
both sides of the theory
and got not only tax cuts
but a vast lot of new
spending programs, too.
The economic ther-
mometer shows overheat-
ing, and that means infla-
tion. This disturbs the
President's convalescence.
He called all hands to Tex-
as to figure out what is
happening. And then
came the decision of the
Federal Reserve Board to
check the spree by raising
the discount rate.
This, Mr. Johnson says,
was done by an indepen-
dent agency. The country
is fortunate that we have
such an independent agen-
cy, because it is plainly
telling us of dangers ahead
which the administration
is not willing to admit.
