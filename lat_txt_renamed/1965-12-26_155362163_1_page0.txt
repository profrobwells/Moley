The Ghosts of Statesmen Past
Could Teach a Giveaway Lesson
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This tale of a Christmas
season many years ago
may disturb many of those
who are anticipating rich
gifts when the President's
budget is presented to
Congress and the country.
But the prospective recipients need not worry.
The lessons from history
are not studied now in
the councils of the Great
Society.
My story concerns what
two departed statesmen,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Harry L. Hopkins, might
say if their ghosts were to
return to earth and talk
with their current counterparts, Lyndon B. Johnson and Sargent Shriver,
who in the odd moments
when he is not running
the Peace Corps is scattering the funds of the War
on Poverty.
I am assuming that the
ghosts in my story can
read, for when they were
walking among mortal
men they were highly articulate individuals, and
that they have noted
Shriver's latest idea about
spending money for the
poor. This plan is called a
"negative income tax."
*
There is nothing negative about it. It is a positive plan to hand out cash.
And it isn't a tax. It is a
gift from the government.
All that it has to do with
taxation is the use of the
income-tax schedules to
determine what is given
away.
The man who claims
that he invented the idea
is Prof. Milton Friedman
of the University of Chicago. I cannot believe that
Friedman was serious
when he gave publicity to
the idea. He is a man with
a hearty sense of humor,
and it is probably a sardonic joke.
Briefly stated, the idea
is that any family that has
an income under $3,000 is
poor. And it does not have
to pay taxes. The government, by a formula based
on federal income-tax accounting, will make up the
difference between what
the family earns and the
poverty limit of $3,000.
I use as an example a
family with an income of
$2,400. There are four
members of the family,
and so there would be a
$600-exemption for each
member and a flat standard deduction of another
$600. But the government
under the Shriver interpretation of the plan must
add enough to make the
family's income total up to
$3,000.
The family already has
$2,400. So the government
gives it $600 to make up
the difference. If the income of a family were $1,-
800, the government
would give twice $600, or
$1,200 more, and so on.
(Friedman would, however, give only half the difference between the income and the $3,000.)
Thus, the concept of an annual income guaranteed
by government, long
dreamed of by socialists,
would be realized. And
this would be direct relief
money. Nobody would
have to work to earn it.
If the head of a family
had $60,000 in the bank
and received only $2,400 in
interest income, the family
would be deemed poor. If
it had land and raised its
own food and the cash income were less than the
$3,000, it would classify as
poor. Presumably there
would be no distinctions,
since a needs test is regarded by the Great Society as degrading.
This is direct federal relief, and here is where the
Roosevelt-Hopkins ghosts
enter the story.
In the Christmas holidays in 1934, when the annual Presidential message
was being written, Mr.
Roosevelt and Hopkins
had decided that federal
relief, even through grants
to the states, had failed.
They reached the decision
that it should stop. And so,
after great care and deliberation, the President's
message said this:
"The federal government must and shall quit
this business of relief.
*
"I am not willing that
the vitality of our people
be further sapped by the
giving of cash, of market
baskets, of a few hours of
weekly work cutting
grass, raking leaves or
picking up papers in the
public parks. We must
preserve not only the
bodies of the unemployed
from destitution, but also
their self-respect, their
self-reliance and courage
and determination."
That is what Mr. Roosevelt and Hopkins decided
after hastily improvised
plans had been tried for
more than a year and a
half. That is what they
said when, unlike the present, there were 11,340,000
workers unemployed.
Their conclusions are in
the record. L.B.J. and
Shriver might learn something if they looked up the
text of that old message.
