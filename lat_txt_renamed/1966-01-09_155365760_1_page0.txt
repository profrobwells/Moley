History of New York's Transit
Shows Senselessness of Strike
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It can easily be ima-
gined that the innumera-
ble people who came to the
New York World's Fair
during the past year and a
half and found traveling in
the great city reasonably
comfortable must be
amazed to hear how, be-
ginning on New Year's
Day, the city could be pa-
ralyzed by a transit work-
ers' strike. Their amaze-
ment must grow as they
hear that this paralysis
could be ordered by one
man, Michael J. Quill,
head of the Transport
Workers Union.
Quill operated in de-
fiance of the law, the
courts, the city govern-
ment, the press and public
opinion generally.
To understand how this
could be, one must go back
over the political history of
the city for nearly 50
years. The very physical
characteristics of the city
made subways a practical
and necessary means of
mass transportation. The
bus system which grew up
has been little more than
an adjunct to the subways.
The subways were built
and operated for a con-
siderable number of years
by private companies, as
were the bus systems.

The Democratic ma-
chine came back into pow-
er in 1917 after four years
of John Purroy Mitchell's
reform administration.
John Hylan became the
machine mayor. He lev-
eled his demagogic attacks
upon the transportation
companies and made a fe-
tish of the Five-Cent Fare.
There was a 10-cent fare
on the main bus system.
It became obvious that
the subways could not pro-
vide proper, efficient and
decent service at five
cents, and so under Hylan
and, after him, James J.
Walker, service deteriorat-
ed and new extensions to
serve a growing city were
not built. Finally, the c...
took over most of the
transportation systems.
During LaGuardia's 12
years in the city hall there
was sufficient courage to
permit the subway fare to
go to 10 cents and then to
15. New lines were built
and service improved.
Then after LaGuardia
the machine came back,
and during the 12 years
just ended there was May-
or Robert F. Wagner. As a
true son of his father, Sen.
Wagner, Mayor Wagner
not only permitted but en-
couraged the rise of Quill
and his TWU.
From time to time when
contracts were up for re-
newal, Wagner and Quill
had quite dramatic and
rather amusing debates,
accompanied by dire
threats of strikes at the
year end. But a settlement
always followed those ami-
able discussions, and the
wages and benefits of the
workers went up and up.
Over the past 10 years
Quill secured wage in-
creases totaling 55.40%.
This was a greater in-
crease than in practically
any other form of employ-
ment.
*
And since the 15-cent
fare was inadequate to
support the wage in-
creases, subsidies were
provided which were paid
by all taxpayers. When
the city was short of mo-
ney, it went hat in hand to
Albany.
Nothing was ever really
settled, and Quill ap-
proached the deadline this
year when Wagner was to
be succeeded by the new
mayor, John V. Lindsay.
Quill was more arrogant
than ever and heaped per-
sonal abuse upon the in-
coming mayor. His de-
mands were absurdly
high. To meet them would
have required an addition-
al $680 million. But Quill
himself admitted that this
"package" was a mere ges-
ture by cutting it to $180
million after a strike was
called. Wagner left the
baby in Lindsay's lap.
â˜…
The main point is that
New York transit workers'
wages are the highest in
any major American city,
and the comparable fare is
the lowest. A New York
motorman gets $3.46 an
hour. In Boston the figure
is $3.04; in Chicago, $3.01;
in Philadelphia, $2.85, and
in Cleveland, $2.81.
This is where the situa-
tion stood as the new year
opened: politically deter-
mined rates of fare and
subsidies upon subsidies.
The whole business makes
no sense.
It responds to no rule of
justice. It has no economic
basis. It is purely political,
and it is the outcome of
years of appeasement of
an arrogant union whose
votes have been deemed
essential to the regime in
the city hall.
