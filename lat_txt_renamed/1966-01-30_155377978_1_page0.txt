Sen. Byrd's Son Can Be Expected
to Carry On Family's Tradition
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Harry Flood Byrd
Jr. was appointed in
November to succeed his
father in the United States
Senate, a new tradition of
continuity may have been
projected in the history of
the Old Dominion State.
For the father had served
32 years in the Senate, and
the son may serve as long.
Re-election of senators in
Virginia is a tradition. In
the past 71 years six sena-
tors have served an aver-
age of 24 years.
There is something
more than continuity that
marks the significance of
the Byrds of Virginia. The
term "one-party system" is
hardly descriptive of what
prevails in most of the
states of the South. For in
most cases there are no
parties at all, only person-
al factions and followings.
Virginia, largely be-
cause of the two Byrds,
has had an authentic De-
mocratic Party organiza-
tion for many years. It has
been building since the el-
der Byrd entered the Vir-
ginia Senate half a centu-
ry ago. After 1926 he
served as governor, and
when Claude Swanson
was appointed by F.D.R.
as secretary of the Navy
he entered the Senate.
There have been refer-
ences to the "Byrd ma-
chine." But the organiza-
tion maintained by the De-
mocratic Party headed by
Harry Flood Byrd has
been quite unlike the dom-
inations and powers of
which we have heard so
much in the United States.
The elder Byrd, capably
assisted by his son since
1940, has created a respon-
sible party organization
which has held its supre-
macy by constant personal
attention to the needs of
the state and has com-
mended itself to a highly
literate electorate by pro-
viding good government
and a prosperous econo-
my.
During his years in the
Senate, the elder Byrd
was accustomed to fare
forth in his automobile
from his home in Winches-
ter on weekends and when
Congress was in recess
travel through the state,
surveying its problems and
maintaining contacts with
leaders in the counties and
cities.
The prudent economic
philosophy of Harry F.
Byrd, so often explained to
the Senate, has survived
many versions of "new
economics" which have
been proclaimed by the
bureaucrats and econom-
ists in Washington and
which have had their rise
and decline. The Byrd phi-
losophy is based upon the
simple proposition that
governments and people
should not spend more
than they earn and that in
what is spent there must
be constant recognition of
the necessity of useful
service.
Unlike most of the new
"isms," this Byrd philoso-
phy has met the pragmatic
test. In their personal en-
terprises farming, fruit
growing and publishing--
the Byrds have prospered.
Their state has seen re-
markable progress since
the great depression.
★
Virginia has an unem-
ployment rate of less than
1%. Industries,
encou-
raged by friendly govern-
ment policies, have moved
to the state in ever-increas-
ing numbers.
Public improvements
such as highways have
made the old state, with its
rich reminders of great
history, a favorite place
for tourists and a home for
many who have fled from
the complications of the
North and Northeast. The
per capita income of Vir-
ginians is the highest in
the, South.
All this striving for econ-
omic growth by internal
development of the state's
resources, the younger
Byrd will carry on. He
served in the Virginia
Senate for 18 years. He
has been chairman of the
Virginia Advisory Board
on Industrial Develop-
ment and Planning, which
he originated four years
ago.
★
In these four years in-
vestment in new plants
and equipment has been
remarkable, and during
the past year alone 97 new
industrial plants have been
established in the state.
Young Harry is not tak-
ing his election at the polls
in November for granted,
for there has been a for-
midable rise in Republi-
can strength in Virginia in
recent years, and he will
have strong opposition.
His concern will be not on-
ly to establish himself as a
junior senator in Washing-
ton; he will, like his father,
by tireless travel maintain
his contacts with the
people of the state.
In Virginia the illustri-
ous past looks over your
shoulder. The Byrds, with-
out rejecting what that
past has taught, have pro-
vided new lessons for the
past and the future.
