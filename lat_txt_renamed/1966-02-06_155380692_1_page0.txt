Some Sort of Political Realignment
in the Near Future Is a Good Bet
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After what happened in
November, 1964, a sort of
paralysis seized many
thoughtful people who had
voted against President
Johnson. Frustration and
even despair abounded.
It was not a mere defeat,
they thought. It was a re-
volution. Only a few ex-
treme conservatives be-
lieved that the oversimpli-
fied prescriptions they had
to offer could suffice to op-
pose the Leviathan of De-
mocratic power and pro-
vide a future for an alter-
native.
The President himself,
possessed of euphoric
dreams, conceived of a
sort of political Pax Ro-
mana or of an Era of Good
Feeling such as followed
the second election of
James Monroe in 1820. Mr.
Johnson, prompted by cer-
tain pundits, called it a
"consensus."
This meant that all
groups and interests —
business, finance, labor,
agriculture and minorities
of all sorts—would be done
with conflict and bow
their heads under a sort of
protectorate. In this, the
directives would come
from the White House, le-
gislated by Congress, and
out of the rich revenues
from abounding prosperi-
ty everybody, or almost
everybody, would enjoy
the narcotic effects of in-
numerable subsidies.
The Great Society sug-
gests the vision of the Pro-
phet Isaiah: "The wolf
shall dwell with the lamb;
and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid; the calf
and the lion and the sheep
shall abide together
and the lion shall eat
straw with the ox."
Some who had fought
against the nomination of
Barry Goldwater and ab-
stained from supporting
him believed that conser-
vatism was dead with the
election and that power in
the Republican Party
would revert to the old
Eastern Establishment.
With this return, the lib-
eral programs of the Dem-
ocrats would be matched
by promises of even more
doses of federal power and
subsidies to win back the
ever-reaching wants of the
electorate.
Others, anticipating a
long sojourn in the minori-
ty wilderness, called for
more and more study and
public education, out of
which new and more ra-
tional formulas might be
created.
Still others advised
mere waiting until the
Democratic colossus,
flushed with power, would
defeat itself. As Sen. Ever-
ett Dirksen said, "A party
does not defeat a party. A
party defeats itself."
Some foresaw a long
period of political flux and
confusion, out of which a
new alignment of parties
would emerge. This is
what happened when the
Federalist Party commit-
ted suicide over "Mr. Mad-
ison's War" in 1812-1815.
There were no real parties
after that until Jackson
came along a decade later.
And those parties were
new in name and content.
All these, except the
first, have arguable sup-
port. But it is a vain hope
that sustains the Eastern
Establishment.
There is an element of
reality in the other three.
There is need for study
and education and the
creation of an alternative
of Johnsonism. It is also
true that the vast power
now possessed by the Pres-
ident and his colleagues
may be abused or, more
likely, misused. Such mis-
use may bring about a
public reaction, perhaps
before 1968 or after. And
there may emerge a new
party alignment—perhaps
with new names, perhaps
not.
What happened in 1965
was the swift adoption of
such a volume of new le-
gislation and new pro-
grams that the federal es-
tablishment will probably
have a severe case of in-
digestion. This may well
take the form of confusion,
inefficiency and even cor-
ruption. I cannot believe
that one central govern-
ment can do all the things
envisioned in the Great So-
ciety.
Nor can I believe that
one man, even as astute
and resourceful a man as
Mr. Johnson, can success-
fully fill the specifications
now provided for the
American Presidency.
The responsibilities of
an office can grow too big
for any incumbent. And
the differences in a nation
so big and variegated as
the United States are too
great for any such thing as
a consensus. The Vietna-
mese war and growing in-
flation are already burst-
ing the seams of the par-
ty in power. The future
has promise for those who
think while they wait.
