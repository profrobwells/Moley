Tyranny Was Involved in Attempt
to Force Repeal of Right to Work
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The basic question
raised in the Senate de-
bate on the repeal of Sec-
tion 14(b) of the Taft-Hart-
ley Act was what is meant
by majority government.
It applied to three aspects
of the issue:
First, the right of a ma-
jority of workers in a com-
pany or industry to impose
their will upon all their
fellow workers.
Next, since the opposi-
tion to repeal in the Senate
was reduced to its last
weapon, a filibuster, there
was the question whether
a congressional majority
has the right to deny to 19
states their right to regu-
late industry in their juris-
diction.
Finally, there was the
question whether the
President and his majority
in Congress would impose
a single will upon minori-
ties everywhere.
All these situations
come down to what has
been called "the tyranny
of the majority." I do not
know when or where or
by whom that expression
was first used. But it first
came to my notice when as
a college student I read a
chapter on the subject in
James Bryce's "The Ameri-
can Commonwealth." The
book was first published in
1893. But that famous Bri-
tish statesman and politi-
cal writer stated a defini-
tion of the tyranny of the
majority which has validi-
ty in the argument about
14(b):
*
"Tyranny consists in the
wanton or inequitable use
of strength by the stronger,
in the use of it to do things
which one equal would not
attempt against another
(equal). A majority is ty-
rannical when it decides
without hearing the mi-
nority, when it suppresses
fair and temperate criti-
cism on its own acts, when
it insists on restraining
men in matters where re-
straint is not required by
the common interest,
when it forces men to con-
tribute money to objects
which they disapprove and
which the common inter-
est does not demand, when
it subjects to social penal-
ties persons who disagree
from it in matters not vital
to the common welfare."
This definition deserves
careful analysis. For
Bryce not only attained re-
nown as a member of the
British Cabinet and as a
diplomat but was, prior to
writing his book about the
United States, a lawyer
who served as regius
professor of civil law at
Oxford. The precision of
his language is apparent.
Substantially all the ele-
ments of his definition ap-
ply to the coercion im-
posed upon workers by the
union in a union shop. But
two of these specifications
stand out:
When a union shop is
imposed in a state without
a right-to-work law, the
union does restrain men
"in matters where re-
straint is not required by
the common interest." In
its political activity, as
well as the spending of
union money for matters
not connected with collec-
tive bargaining, it does
force men "to contribute
money to objects which
they disapprove."
It will be noted that
Bryce uses the words "the
common interest" in both
cases. It is abundantly
clear that under state
right-to-work laws unions
have prospered. Thus, the
common interest of work-
ers is not impaired when
some workers have em-
ployment despite their ab-
stention from union mem-
bership.
Moreover, when the
unions flagrantly and in
violation of another sec-
tion of the Taft-Hartley
Act contribute money to
political affairs, they are
using the money of some
members who disagree
with those political objec-
tives for parties and candi-
dates the union bosses fa-
vor.
This use of political
power was at the root of
President Johnson's de-
mand that 14(b) be re-
pealed. That is the price
he was compelled, or
thinks he was compelled,
to pay for the support of
unions in his campaign in
1964.
Tyranny is involved,
moreover, when the repre-
sentatives in Congress pro-
pose to subject 19 states to
the will of a national ma-
jority. And if or when a
congressional majority
votes to repeal 14(b), it im-
poses tyranny over not on-
ly the legislatures of those
states but their representa-
tives in Congress.

The argument for repeal
on the basis that some non-
union workers get a "free
ride" was irrelevant to the
issue. The real purpose of
the move for repeal has
been that it makes it unne-
cessary for union leaders
and officers to make union
membership sufficiently
attractive to appeal to all
workers.
