One Good Way to Insure
Having ‘Coattail Congress’
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The President’s proposal for a
four-year term for members of the
House of Representatives would, if
written into the Constitution, have
two effects. It would greatly in-
crease any President’s domination
over the House, and it would lead ul-
timately to a one-party government.
For the plan is to elect all members
in a Presidential election.
This sort of constitutional amend-
ment fits snugly into L.B.J.’s grand
design to impose on this country
complete domination by his majority
in the Democratic Party. Most of his
programs already enacted are calcu-
lated to cement several powerful
minority groups into a monolithic
political potential. This in large part
would be based upon exacting rev-
enues from all the people and distri-
buting them to bribe-favored minori-
ties.

In the past few years the Senate
has been more and more obedient to
Presidential directives, and its De-
mocratic-liberal majority seems safe
for years to come.
The House, closer to the electorate
because of shorter terms, remains
the final hope of the two-party sys-
tem.
But if, as planned, the terms of
House members should be leng-
thened to four years, the majority
would almost certainly be swept in
with the Presidential candidate.
The President’s argument for this
change is a collection of half-truths.
He said when he asked for the
changes that it would attract as can-
didates “the best men in private or
public life.” But, instead of the best
and most independent and cou-
rageous people, it would attract
those who would seek the advantage
of running as supporters of the Pres-
idential candidates.
It would attract people who crave
a sure thing, with long tenure un-
troubled by biennial tests at the
polls. It would remove members
further from the obligation to keep
close to and serve the needs of their
constituents.
It may be annoying to some mem-
bers to maintain close relations with
the people at home in their districts.
But if popular government means
anything, those people are entitled
to close contacts with and contin-
uous control of their representatives.
Whatever independence members
now have from the House leaders
and the men in the White House is
gained by knowing that they have
the confidence of the people back
home.
Good representatives give con-
stant attention to their constituents,
They do this by answering their
mail; by periodic, sometimes weekly
letters to their constituents; by see-
ing people from home who come to
Washington, and by presenting their
constituents’ views to the House—on
the floor or in the Congressional
Record.
These services are not too great a
burden for members have allowed
themselves fairly lavish personal
staffs of assistants. If a congressman
is as industrious as he should be, he
still has the time to study and vote
upon the bills before his committees
and the House.
On the practical side, the Johnson
argument falls short. A considerable
number of House members are fair-
ly sure of re-election. Many have no
opposition. This is especially true of
members who have large influence
because of seniority.
Finally, there is the need for hold-
ing a President and/or a congres-
sional majority to strict accountabili-
ty. The mid-term election, especially
in a year like 1966, is a useful refer-
endum on Presidential and congres-
sional policies.
Four years is too long to give a
grant of unchecked power to any
President, any party or any mem-
ber. That is especially true in chang-
ing times like these. We need not
only efficient government, but re-
sponsible government. The makers
of the Constitution planned it that
way. It should remain that way.
