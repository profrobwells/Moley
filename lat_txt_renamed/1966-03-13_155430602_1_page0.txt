Psychiatry as a Science
Offers Boon to Justice
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In late February the U.S. Court of
Appeals in the Second Circuit esta-
blished what some have called a
new rule of responsibility for a cri-
minal action. It will bind and may
still confuse juries in New York,
Connecticut and Vermont.
The case concerned a defendant
named Freeman, a dope addict for
15 years who was charged with sell-
ing heroin to undercover agents.
The lower federal court found him
guilty and imposed a sentence of
five years in prison. The Court of
Appeals reversed the conviction and
ordered a new trial in which the
"new" determination of responsibili-
ty would be used.
It was declared by the appeals
court that a new rule of mental in-
competence should supplant the
century-old M'Naghten test, which
has measurably guided courts in
Britain and America since 1843.
*
Because of this, I turned back to
the yellowing pages of a chapter on
criminal insanity in a book I had
written in the late 1920s when I
was a professor in Columbia Uni-
versity. In that I had summed up
the law as it stood at that time.
I find that there has been little in
the years since to clear up the confu-
sion, although many cases have been
decided and the American Law In-
stitute has published a "new" rule
after nine years of study. The ques-
tion of mental competence is still
what I called it then, a "riddle."
The old M'Naghten rule arose
from a sensational case in England.
M'Naghten was an obviously de-
ranged person who imagined that
he was being persecuted and decid-
ed that Sir Robert Peel, the prime
minister, was his enemy. He set out
to kill Peel, but through mistaken
identity killed Peel's private secre-
tary, Mr. Drummond, instead.
M'Naghten was acquitted because
the court decided that the defendant
was so obsessed by his imagined per-
secution that he could not distin-
guish between the right and wrong
in his act.
*
The House of Lords then directed
certain questions to the judges in the
case, and the result was the famous
M'Naghten rule. This permitted ac-
quittal when it was "clearly proved
that, at the time of committing the
act, the accused was laboring under
such a defect of reason, from disease
of the mind, as not to know the na-
ture and quality of the act he was
doing, or, if he did know it, that he
did not know he was doing what
was wrong." The decision would be
made by the jury.
But as this rule came to be applied
in Britain, it was possible for juries
to return a verdict of "guilty but in-
sane." After such a verdict, the ac-
cused would be kept in custody as "a
criminal lunatic" during "the King's
pleasure."
In the United States the M'Nagh-
ten rule has been followed, but with
the growth of the science of psychia-
try institutions have been created
for custody and treatment. It is this
that the Court of Appeals has rei-
terated in an opinion by Judge Irv-
ing R. Kaufman.
It was clear even in the 1920s
when I wrote the chapter to which I
have referred that the final word
cannot be left to the psychiatrists.
They can testify for both sides, and
the jury with instructions from the
judge makes the final decision.
*
What distinguishes the Court of
Appeals opinion from that of 1843 is
that an enlightened regard for the
public interest determines that the
authority of the state should be exer-
cised in order that such incompe-
tents should not repeat the criminal
acts.
The differences and gradations of
responsibility are so great that irre-
sponsible persons must be controlled
and, if possible, restored to mental
health.
Occasionally a case arises in
which an accused may clearly know
that he is doing something wrong,
but lacks self-control at the moment
of the crime. That, too, is a matter
for institutional care.
The hopeful factor in this con-
fused state of the law and practice is
the growth of psychiatry into a real
science. At the time I wrote about it,
I suggested that psychiatry was "an
art trying to be a science." It has
become more of a science in recent
years.
But accused persons must still be
subject to the common sense of judg-
es and juries. The Court of Appeals
has made no revolutionary change.
But it has helped in the education of
judges and the public. Justice goes
beyond the question of the individ-
ual. It also involves the public inter-
est and security.
