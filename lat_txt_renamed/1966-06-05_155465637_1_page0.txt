The Undertaxing of Land
Hampers Urban Growth
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the American people face any
problem that approaches our com-
mitment in Vietnam, it is how our
bursting and sprawling urban com-
munities are going to get sufficient
money to meet their needs. It may
be anticipated that the Vietnamese
dilemma may be resolved in a few
years, but the urban problem will
haunt us for the rest of the century.
The urban problem is not merely
the crowding into the central cities
of a host of Negroes and other im-
poverished people. As this influx of
needy people into the central cities
increases, more and more middle-in-
come people, regardless of race, are
moving into the suburbs or beyond
the suburbs. This means the necessi-
ty of finding houses to live in and
the conveniences necessary to serve
them.

It is reliably estimated that in the
next 30 years something like $80 bil-
lion a year must be invested in build-
ing and rebuilding. Despite the tall
talk from Washington that Uncle
Sam will find ways to solve this
problem, it is going to be necessary
for private enterprise to carry at
least 90% of the responsibility.
In an address to the Home Buil-
ders Assn. of St. Louis recently, P. I.
Prentice, who served for several
years as editor and publisher of the
builders and developers' magazine,
House & Home, emphasized the ma-
jor reason why the building and
developing industry is facing vast
difficulties in meeting the need.
He used as a text for his speech a
sentence written by David Ricardo a
century and a half ago: "The inter-
ests of the landowner are directly
opposed to the interests of every oth-
er element of the economy." It must
be noted in evaluating this state-
ment that Ricardo qualified for his
classical treatise on political econo-
my by a brilliantly successful career
in business. He was no closet philos-
opher, but a very practical man.
Prentice applies this principle of
Ricardo to the critical urban prob-
lem in the United States by saying
that what is good for the landowner
is bad for the land developer, the
home builder, the building material
manufacturer, the architect, the
mortgage lender, the realtor and
that unfortunate fellow at the end of
the line, the home buyer.
We hear a lot these days about
inflation. But this usually centers
upon rising prices for groceries,
clothing and other products in daily
use. There is another sort of infla-
tion which is much more serious. It
is inflation in the prices of land,
especially land in and around the
great urban complexes into which
countless people are moving every
day.
Prentice says that while President
Johnson is lamenting the fact that
the cost of living is rising between
2% and 3% a year, "landowners
have been upping their prices by
something like 15% a year com-
pounded quarterly." This, he says, is
pricing good new housing out of the
market. He quotes Thomas Coogan,
the elder statesman of the home
building industry: "Today all the
profit is in the land."
The reason for this inflation in
land prices is not that land is scarce.
It has nothing to do with the law of
supply and demand. Prentice points
out that the Indianapolis Planning
Commission found 79,000 acres of
unused land within minutes of
downtown. The air traveler can ver-
ify this any day by noting the great
unused acreage all around the city
he is approaching.

This unnatural and uneconomic
inflation in land is, according to
Prentice, due to two causes, both of
which are susceptible to a remedy.
One is underassessment. Prentice
cites examples. On Long Island an
acre is priced at $20,000 and as-
sessed at $300-400. In Salt Lake City
a man paid $6,000 for land assessed
at $300.
Consequently, unused land is un-
dertaxed.
Thus, landowners can hold land
off the market or sell at inflated pri-
ces. For it costs very little to hold it
for still higher prices.
And the burden falls upon the
builder and the man who wants a
place to live. It sounds like wry
comedy. But it is true.
