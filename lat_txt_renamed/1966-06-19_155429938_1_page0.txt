What Happens When
Our Vigilance Falters
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The decision of the Supreme
Court voiding the conviction 12
years ago of Dr. Samuel H. Shep-
pard for the murder of his wife
should stand as a severe warning to
all judges, law enforcement officers
and young men in the law schools
who at some time will be profession-
ally concerned with the administra-
tion of justice.
It might be well for some irre-
sponsible elements in the press and
the airways to study the decision.
For while most newspapers scrupu-
lously regard the rights of a defen-
dant, one newspaper in Cleveland
comes in for some attention in the
opinion of the Supreme Court.
The decision is an account of the
prejudicial and carnival atmosphere
which surrounded the trial and con-
viction of Sheppard in a murderâ€”
the brutal, lurid nature of which de-
fies description. That atmosphere
was, according to Justice (Clark,
largely created by leakage by en-
forcement officers and the laxness of
the presiding judge which permitted
disorder in the courtroom and the
exposure of the jury to prejudicial
comment.

I have a special interest in com-
menting on this decision and the cir-
cumstances that moved the Su-
preme Court to its decision. For in
1920 as director of the Cleveland
Foundation I brought about a com-
prehensive survey of the adminis-
tration of justice in the same juris-
diction where the Sheppard trial
took place. (The crime was commit-
ted in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, of
which Cleveland is the county seat.)
Our investigation was initiated be-
cause there was a quite general
lowering of the competence and in-
tegrity of law administration in
Cleveland which was caused in part
by inimical political influences. To
direct the actual study, we brought
Dean Roscoe Pound and Prof. Felix
Frankfurter of the Harvard Law
School to Cleveland. They assem-
bled a staff of experts who studied
the courts, the prosecuting office
and the correctional institutions in
some depth.
The facts revealed were most se-
rious, and the impact of the investi-
gation was such as to bring about
notable improvements. For some
years afterward, a citizens' organiza-
tion acted as a sort of watchdog over
criminal-law administration, much
as the Chicago Crime Commission
acted some time earlier.
Apparently, however, from what
Justice Clark describes in his opi-
nion, the movement for reform died
out, and in 1951, when Sheppard
was tried, many of the old practices
were resumed.
Thus, to me a reading of the Clark
indictment of the courts and prose-
cution in Cleveland is history re-
peating itself.
The most serious indictment by
the Supreme Court is directed at the
trial judge in the case, A. Edward
Blythin, who is now dead. He was
responsible for maintaining fairness,
order and decorum, and he failed on
many counts. As Justice Clark says,
the judge is the master of the court-
house in such an instance.
With laxness at the top, the va-
rious law-enforcement officers by
general leakage of information per-
mitted the trial to become a real
hanging affair. It is important to
note that because of the spectacular
nature of the crime certain out-of-
town sensational writers and com-
mentators flocked to Cleveland like
bees to a flower garden. The jury
was not protected from outside in-
fluences, and the one newspaper
named in the Clark opinion provid-
ed plenty of irresponsible editorial-
izing.
The judge, instead of making sure
that the case would be tried in an-
other, less overheated jurisdiction,
permitted the trial to be held in
Cleveland. Nor was sufficient time
allowed to permit the public fer-
ment to quiet down. It is not without
significance that the judge and the
prosecuting attorney were up for re-
election that year.
The recurrence of this condition
in Cleveland after a period of better
behavior is a sad commentary on
government in a democracy.
Moreover, it is a mournful reflection
on the operation of law enforcement,
when judges and prosecutors are
chosen at popular elections. It is not
likely that such a performance
would ever have taken place in Bri-
tain.
Reform is a fragile thing when it
depends upon public opinion. In-
competence feeds on public apathy.
Then reform enters with pious in-
tentions. And after a while the pub-
lic forgets and the old order returns.
Perhaps that is what we pay for de-
mocracy. But it is a very high price.
