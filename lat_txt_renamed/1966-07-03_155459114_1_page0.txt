Newborn Medicare Even
Disowned by Its Father
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When the man who is called "the
father of Medicare" calls the law
"fuzzy" and views with alarm the
inequities in its prospective adminis-
tration, it is small wonder that so
many others are concerned. State of-
ficials, hospital managers, doctors
and prospective beneficiaries are
even more concerned than Sen. Clin-
ton P. Anderson, who labored for at
least four years to get the program
approved by Congress.
In an interview with Anderson
published in the Albuquerque Tri-
bune, in Anderson's home state, the
senator said recently:
"When we passed the Medicare
bill, there was a great deal said that
the hospital end of it was fairly well
understood. We in Congress talked
about it for years and knew what it
meant. Now we find out the law is
fuzzy."
Anderson objects to the confusion
in the plans made by the two agen-
cies charged with the administration
of the program-the Social Security
Administration and the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare.
This confusion is an old story. The
present idea of a Medicare program
originated in the heat of the 1960
Presidential campaign. It was advo-
cated by John F. Kennedy as a fine
gesture to win the votes of the mil-
lions who had passed the age of 65.
Apparently it worked as a politi-
cal issue. But the promise was reck-
lessly made when its political spon-
sors hadn't the faintest idea of how
the plan was to be operated.
In such a political campaign, the
candidate and his helpers have little
time for laborious planning. Getting
the votes is paramount. AND Mr.
Kennedy's running mate, Lyndon B.
Johnson, excoriated everyone who
pointed out the inequities and diffi-
culties of putting such a gigantic
plan in operation as blind and cal-
lous about the medical needs of old
people.
He sneered at those who said that
the plan should be limited to people
who not only needed the care but
whose financial means were insuffi-
cient. The expression "pauper's
oath" was used in that campaign to
attack the critics and doubters. Ev-
erybody, they said, should partici-
pate, whether they needed the help
or not.

After John Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson were elected there was a
great hullabaloo designed to push
the plan through Congress. That
failed in the Kennedy years. Con-
gressional committees wrestled with
the idea without successfully creat-
ing a plan. Then after the death of
President Kennedy his successor,
with greater influence, pushed the
bill through a still doubting Con-
gress.
Thus, Congress under fire by
pressure groups and whipped by the
President dumped the job of admi-
nistering an impossible operation on
the bureaucracy.
That the legislation goes far be-
yond even Mr. Kennedy's glowing
picture in 1960 is shown by Title 19
of the act. This provision proposes
to cover not only the medically
needy people over 65 included in
the Kerr-Mills plan enacted during
the Eisenhower administration,
along with the blind and the impov-
erished children provided for earli-
er, but a great many others. This
will run up the costs to a tremen-
dous and indeterminate sum-costs
in federal money and matching
sums from the states.

Up to now eight states have
passed enabling laws. Others are
still trying to meet the target date as
this is written. The Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare Department hasn't
the slightest idea of how much feder-
al money will be needed to meet the
demands of the states.
Many observers, including this
writer, pointed out four or five years
ago that no one could estimate the
cost. Now that prediction is realized.
Hospitals are faced by an unbeara-
ble burden. Doctors are unhappy
about the fees allowed. The old
people are waiting to flood the facili-
ties in great numbers.
And, as noted above, even the
"father" of Medicare is unhappy
about the very law he helped to
pass.
