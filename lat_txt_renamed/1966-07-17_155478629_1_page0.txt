Republican governors in their
speeches and interviews at the an-
nual Governors' Conference over the
past five years have invariably
seemed to be off the target.
They are out of touch with mem-
bers of their party in Congress who
are deeply involved in national af-
fairs. And as members of a minority
party, some of them have ambitions
to be nominated on the next national
ticket.
This year, with Nelson Rockefel-
ler tied to a deadlocked legislature
in Albany and also quite out of con-
sideration for 1968, only George
Romney and Mark O. Hatfield of
Oregon are regarded as "available."
Romney is considered a possible
candidate for President, Hatfield for
Vice-President.
On the Vietnam issue both indi-
cated views at variance with Repub-
lican policy in Congress. For Hat-
field proposed a dove-like resolu-
tion, which was decisively voted
down.
Romney talked quite a bit, but
seemed to be devoid of any positive
views on Vietnam. This lack of
knowledge or of opinion on a war
that has been growing in intensity
for a long time and that has become
the paramount issue before this
country provides poor evidence of
his capacity to oppose President
Johnson in 1968.
The limp performance of Republi-
can governors was in sharp contrast
to the positive position of Richard
Nixon and the Republican leader-
ship in Congress. The views of Nix-
on and the GOP congressional lead-
ership not only have been correct so
far as the war strategy is concerned,
but are sound political strategy as
well.
They anticipated the intensifica-
tion of the war effort itself. For
months they have called for more ef-
fective bombing of the sources of
Communist supplies and have fa-
vored a quarantine or blockade of
North Vietnam.
Thus, if the Johnson policies
bring Hanoi to a bid for peace before
November, the President's populari-
ty will rise to great heights. And all
doves and quasi-doves will be in
grave political trouble.
For the Republican Party to fol-
low the Romney-Hatfield pattern
this year or before 1968 would in the
event that the administration's poli-
cy is vindicated, leave the GOP in
the position in which the Federalists
found themselves when they op-
posed "Mr. Madison's War" in 1812-
14.
At that time Gen. Andrew
Jackson's victory and the treaty of
peace which shortly preceded it ob-
literated the Federalist Party. More
than a decade passed before a two-
party system re-appeared in Ameri-
can politics.
Speaking as the GOP House lead-
er, Gerald Ford not only has sup-
ported the bombing of oil depots in
North Vietnam, but criticizes the
President by saying he could have
shortened the war by ordering it six
months ago.
Republican candidates this year
should realize that if they support
our action in Vietnam now they will
be in a position to say that ever
since 1964 the GOP has favored
strong action. If the war drags on
they will benefit by the protest
among Democrats against the Pres-
ident without asking for it.
Another hard fact to be consi-
dered is that even if Hanoi calls for
a cease fire, the negotiations will go
on for a long time, certainly for
months and perhaps for a year or
more. That is always Communist
strategy when aggression has been
stopped.
It happened in Korea. It would
certainly happen in Vietnam. For
the Communist doctrine is to stall
negotiations and plan for further ag-
gressions. And during all this period
the central issue will still be un-
settled.
The overriding issue is to make
sure that communism will not be
permitted to dominate Southeast
Asia. That is an American necessity,
and Republicans should never for-
get it.
