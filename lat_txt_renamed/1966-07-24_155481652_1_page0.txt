Lonely Decisions Are
the Lot of the President
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A distinguished commentator,
whose morsels of advice to Pres-
idents and candidates have been
washed down by the breakfast cof-
fee in countless American homes,
was appalled by President Johnson's
rather moving description in his
Omaha speech of the lonely respon-
sibility he carries for the decision in
the Vietnam war.
The President said that while ma-
ny may advise and some may con-
sent, he is the "only one who has
been chosen by the people to de-
cide."
The President summed up a great
constitutional truth in those few
words. In the vast authority vested
in him as Chief Executive and Com-
mander-in-Chief of the armed forces
there is inherent not only the power
to involve his country in hostilities,
but also-especially in such an in-
stance as the bombing of North Viet-
nam-to order such steps as will in
his judgment win a war.
*
That power has scarcely been
questioned in all the years since
Washington took the oath of office
in 1789. Presidents have exercised
the power consistently not only to
precipitate armed conflict, but to re-
strain an excited nation in a crisis
from plunging us into war.
Jefferson imposed the famous em-
bargo against the British despite the
opposition of American trading in-
terests. The war that followed later
was "Mr. Madison's War." And be-
cause the Federalist Party opposed
that war it was shattered and never
revived.
President Polk made the decisions
which meant war with Mexico. Lin-
coln alone decided to reinforce Fort
Sumter, the decision that opened
four sanguinary years of civil strife.
And President Truman first ordered
American resistance to the Commu-
nists in Korea and then appealed to
the United Nations.
Once the country is engaged in
war, the President makes the deci-
sions of major military strategy.
That is what a commander-in-chief
is supposed to do.
To see how inevitable this Pres-
idential power is, let us consider
what the alternative might be. Wars
may begin before there is time to get
Congress to act. Congress may not
be in session, as in October, 1962,
when President Kennedy moved in
the Cuban crisis. When an enemy at-
tacks, quick response is absolutely
essential. No one else can be vested
with such responsibility.

Fifty-one years ago a gifted young
writer wrote a whole book which an-
swers the Johnson critics today.
That 1915 book was "The Stakes of
Diplomacy." Its author was Walter
Lippmann. Under a chapter titled
"A discovery for Democrats" he said
in part, referring to the reaction
here after the sinking of the Lusita-
nia:
"The responsibility and the pow-
er, so tremendous that it might de-
cide the world war, so far-reaching
that it might alter our whole histo-
ry, turned for a few dizzy days on
the judgment of one man. Had Mr.
Wilson wished war with Germany
he could have had it. We were in his
hands, and no amount of elections,
or constitutional reservations about
the right of Congress to declare war,
can alter the fact that the real war-
making power in the United States
is the President.
*
"Our Presidents are elected by va-
rious means; the deliberate choice
even of domestic policies plays a
small part; the choice of foreign poli-
cies enters practically not at all.
"Traditional American policy is so
vague that the administration may
subscribe to it and still do pretty
much whatever it pleases. It is no
real check on the power of the Pres-
ident. In reality it is the great bul-
wark of his power."
As Mr. Lippmann also said in
1915:
"The reason why we trust one
man, rather than many, is because
one man can negotiate and many
can't."
And only one man can make the
military decisions that make negoti-
ation possible.
