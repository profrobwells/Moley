The Same Old Questions,
but---With New Answers
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Never have I ventured to call
myself a professional economist,
though some of the observations I
have written for newspapers have
had economic overtones. A trip dur-
ing the past three weeks in England,
Ireland and-Scotland was certainly
not taken to study and report upon
the economic crisis in the United
Kingdom which is said to be pass-
ing. (In Ireland there is no such cri-
sis, so far as I could determine.)
The trip was primarily devoted to
visiting spots of literary interest-
the Sir Walter Scott country, the
Lake Region, Stratford and London.
But the newspapers were part of the
daily reading, and a number of su-
perficial observations were inescap-
able. Most of them dealt with the
state of the British economy and
what Harold Wilson's socialist
government was doing about it.

The corrective measures taken by
Her Majesty's government remind-
ed me of what an economics profes-
sor said when he was told that his
examination questions, which were
the same year after year, were being
passed on by each generation of
students to the next and the next:
"It doesn't matter whether they
know the questions before the exa-
mination. The answers are different
every year."
I had been in the United Kingdom
on three occasions since the war-in
1950, 1955 and 1959-during general
elections, and, as was to be expected,
economic questions and proposed so-
lutions were the substance of the
campaign issues. For the most part,
the underlying question then and
now is the same. It was and is how a
small country with limited resour-
ces and with the loss of its overseas
possessions could support an exces-
sively large population. It isn't a
population "explosion" that the
United Kingdom is now confronting.
That explosion took place long be-
fore this, and the number of people
who must find a living is not much
greater than it was many years ago.

What seems to have plagued the
governments of both major political
parties is how to support more and
more people by the labor of fewer
and fewer. This is the grim impera-
tive of the welfare state. Neither
party dares to tamper with what are
called "the social services." Hence,
the economies which are necessary
must be in the very sectors upon
which the greatness of Britain once
rested-the navy, the merchant ma-
rine and the military forces necessa-
ry to protect the dwindling posses-
sions overseas.
When the economy perked up in
the past year or so, the great goal of
earlier years, "full employment,"
was realized. But this goal, when
once reached, proved to be an illu-
sion. For with jobs for everyone it
appeared that not everyone was ca-
pable or willing to carry the burden
of a job. "Drones" were so numerous
that the contagion of lessening ef-
fort moved through the whole work-
ing class.
And so the Wilson government
decided upon two policies, one of
which seemed to me to make no
sense at all. The other created a big
split between the trade unions and
the governing Labor Party which
originally was created by the trade
unions themselves.
The first was an enforced "disem-
ployment." The big automotive in-
dustry, for instance, not only re-
duced the number of workers, but
cut the working hours of those who
were retained. And heavier taxes
were imposed upon those who still
had an income.
Bewildered by this move which it
seemed to me, would reduce produc-
tion in one of Britain's largest ex-
port industries. I asked an Australi-
an whom I met in a city in northern
England for an explanation. He said
that with the dismissal of thousands
of workers the threat of more sack-
ings would make the remainder
work harder.
The second device was the imposi-
tion of a wage freeze. This brought
about a sharp conflict with the big
trade unions. The trade union lead-
ers realized, perhaps, for the first
time that the politicians running the
government under a Labor majority
had interests of their own quite dis-
tinct from their obligations to the
trade unions.
Thus, the "planned" economy
which British socialists have been
promising for many years ran
squarely against the freedom to bar-
gain. Theory was confronted by
facts of life. And the end is not in
sight.
