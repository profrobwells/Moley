The Real Campaign Issues
Are Below the Waterline
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In this political campaign, as in
every campaign, there are two sets
of issues. The one is what the Re-
publicans and some Democrats are
talking about—the conduct of war,
inflation, crime, centralized govern-
ment and the credibility gap. The
other issues are not spoken, at least
not in the oratory of responsible
candidates, but they will weigh hea-
vily in the voters’ verdict in Novem-
ber.
These latter are in the minds and
emotional reflexes of the American
people. You don’t hear many voters
talking about them. They seldom re-
veal them to the pollsters. But they
are there, and really smart and ex-
perienced candidates know they are
there. Democrats like L.B.J. try
to counter them with catalogues of
what the 89th Congress has pro-
vided in benefits.
The decisive factors in a political
campaign are like an iceberg. There
is what you see and the greater part
that you don’t see.
The most important of these hid-
den factors is a revolt against the
“ins.” Despite a long stretch of na-
tional prosperity and despite a lot of
handouts, most Americans are not
happy. They see their future with
apprehension, as through a cloud
darkly. And since government takes
so much credit for things nowadays,
unhappy people blame government
for what they don’t like.
This revolt against the “ins” has
shown itself in several primaries
where Democratic stalwarts have
been defeated. In a few instances it
shows itself in resentment against
Republicans in office. In New York
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller is desper-
ately fighting against a tide of un-
popularity.
People are sick of hearing and
reading about Congress. This long
session, running into the tenth
month, is getting on our nerves. We
believe it should have wound up its
business in six months.
Voters seldom vote for someone or
something. They vote against some-
body or something. Franklin Roose-
velt wasn’t chosen in 1932; Herbert
Hoover was rejected; John Kennedy
wasn’t chosen in 1960; Richard Nix-
on was defeated because people
were not happy about what Dwight
Eisenhower had done.
Reason is not dominant in politi-
cal decisions. Habit and emotion
take over.
The war in Vietnam is unpopular.
Some believe we should never have
got into it. Others believe we haven’t
been fighting effectively. Both sen-
timents are aimed at L.B.J.
Call it what you will, there is a
great and growing resentment
against the Negro community. In
part this is directed against Negro
leaders and their white co-workers.
The demonstrations have become
wearing on people’s tolerance. The
rise of black power has intensified
the reaction, for Americans don’t
like to be threatened. And somehow
the rise in the crime rate is attribut-
ed to the Negro revolution.

Not a little of the white emotional
response is directed at Democrats
for their responsibility in holding
out expectations to Negroes that
cannot be fulfilled. It has been the
party in power that has sought Ne-
gro votes by raising impossible ex-
pectations. For that, white politici-
ans are blamed.
A close student can, by an exa-
mination of the great body of legisla-
tion which L.B.J. is telling about in
his impassioned speeches, see the
benefits that have been provided for
countless people. But the average
voter doesn’t understand these mea-
sures. And despite all the blessings
the old reaction takes place: “What
have you done for me lately?”
Finally, there is the unhappy fact
that while Lyndon B. Johnson is re-
garded as a strong and active Pres-
ident, he is not loved as some Pres-
idents have been loved in the past.
T.R. was loved and admired. Wood-
row Wilson was admired and re-
spected until his final two years in
office. Calvin Coolidge was amusing.
F.D.R. was loved. And Gen. Eisen-
hower held his popularity even
though there was some disagree-
ment with his policies. John F. Ken-
nedy was a winsome and attractive
figure whose personality might have
surmounted the difficulties now en-
countered by his successor.
★
Lingering doubts mar the image
of L.B.J. Some of these rise from a
feeling that his assurances cannot be
believed. And even when he is most
vehemently sincere he cannot wrap
himself in the folds of public accep-
tance. Democratic candidates run-
ning for re-election sense this, and
few are now talking about “all the
way with L.B.J.” In general, the
President, despite his good inten-
tions, is no longer an asset to his
party.
These hidden issues may be un-
fair. But they are stark realities
which no oratory, either Democratic
or Republican, can change. They
may well prevail when the votes are
cast in November.
