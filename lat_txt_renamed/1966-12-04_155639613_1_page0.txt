Labor Suffers the Results
of Mixing Into Politics
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The politically oriented labor
leaders who so happily took seats in
the pre-election omnibus now find
themselves deep in the wreckage.
They should have anticipated such
an outcome when, rejecting the wise
policy of Samuel Gompers, they al-
lied themselves with the Democratic
Party. For many things can happen
to a national party or a President
which they cannot prevent; and
when something happens, everyone
concerned suffers.
There were many factors that con-
tributed to the 1966 vote of no con-
fidence in this Democratic regime-
the conduct of the war, inflation,
crime, backlash and L.B.J.'s perso-
nality. Anti-union sentiment was on-
ly a minor root of resentment. But
the union leaders were rejected be-
cause they had made an unwise
marriage long ago.
That ought to give those leaders a
great deal of food for reflection. But
perhaps they are too old for reflec-
tion and are living too much in the
past.
For a moment let us recall that
past.
In 1936 John L. Lewis threw the
energies and treasure of the newly
organized CIO into the service of
President Roosevelt and his party.
Many wise people in the labor move-
ment regretted that break from the
non-party policy of Gompers. They
felt that if, some time in the future,
the Republican Party should return
to power, the Lewis-Roosevelt alli-
ance would be bad for the unions.
Lewis himself in a few years
seemed to regret his 1936 decision.
For when Mr. Roosevelt did some-
thing he didn't like he bitterly told
the President that he was an in-
grate. He had, Lewis said, "supped
at labor's table."
But the Reuthers and Hillmans
and others plunged ahead, and after
a great increase in union member-
ship in World War II the unions' po-
litical mechanism, COPE, became a
major factor in Democratic affairs.
It is probable that President Tru-
man owed his election in 1948 to the
work of the unions in the precincts.
From then on into the late 1950s
COPE operated with great efficien-
cy. Innumerable pro-COPE state le-
gislators were elected, and a good
number of governors, senators and
congressmen owed their offices to
labor.
The summit of COPE's ascenden-
cy was in 1958 when, because right-
to-work was on the ballot, pro-labor
Democrats swept the states of Ohio
and California. Indeed, at that time
many people believed that the De-
mocratic Party had been trans-
formed into something like the Bri-
tish Labor Party. In several states
COPE held the balance of power for
the Democrats.
But, as so often is the case in hu-
man affairs, the decline of an insti-
tution begins when it seems to be at
the height of its influence and glory.
In 1960 COPE still operated at every
level. COPE and, through it, big
unions freely violated the Taft-Hart-
ley prohibition against using union
money in politics. U.S. attorneys ge-
neral after a brief and unsuccessful
effort to prosecute the United Auto
Workers regarded that law as a dead
letter.
But after 1960 the unions' political
power has declined. There were ma-
ny reasons for this:
The business of social reform was
taken over by Presidents Kennedy
and Johnson. And credit was taken
by those Presidents and Congress.
Since the Reuthers and others had
been more interested in reform than
in collective bargaining they found
their occupation gone.
A new generation of workers
came into the unions which, know-
ing little of past struggles for union
recognition, paid less heed to the ex-
hortation of the old leaders.
The leaders themselves were
growing old. There was something
pathetically ineffective in Gus
Scholle's efforts to elect Mennen
Williams in Michigan this year.
Most important, the rise in income
among union workers drew them in-
to middle-class communities. And
they thought and acted in politics
like their neighbors and ignored the
directives of union leaders.
And, finally, in 1966 along with
Americans generally they lost their
enthusiasm for L.B.J.
These factors and many more
have eroded the political power of
the unions. Unable to terminate
their alliance with the Democratic
Party, they have had to share in its
misfortunes.
