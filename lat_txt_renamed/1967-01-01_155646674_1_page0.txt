Everyone's a Loser in
the Manchester Book Row
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A newspaper headline last week
said of Mrs. John F. Kennedy, "With
Victory in Her Bag, Jackie Will
Take a Trip." This prompts me to
repeat an old gag about the man in
the Louvre who was looking at the
battered statue of the Winged Victo-
ry. He said, "If that is victory, I
would like to see defeat."
Aside from the compassion one
feels for Mrs. Kennedy, who has suf-
fered deeply, a sober appraisal of
her behavior in her relations with
the author, William Manchester,
and her lawsuit against the publica-
tion of his book is that Mrs. Kenne-
dy lost her composure and precipi-
tated exactly what she sought to
prevent. All the other participants
in the imbroglio lost stature, even
respect, by their actions.
The "settlement" of the lawsuit
about his book shows that Manches-
ter made an agreement with Robert
Kennedy so vague that its terms
could never be adequately interpret-
ed by a court. And Mrs. Kennedy's
charges against him must per-
manently injure his reputation as a
writer.
The publishers, by agreeing to the
deletions, show that before suit was
brought against them they were
willing to publish material which
was not relevant to the story they
intended to print. Only the peril of
great monetary loss forced them to
agree to the deletions. And they will
suffer the reproach that they have
published not the whole story, but a
doctored version of history.
Robert Kennedy by his participa-
tion in the affair revealed himself as
a man who would-and did, as it has
proved-rewrite history according
to his own specifications, just as
when he sat in a seat of power he
had attempted to direct the flow of
news. He stands revealed as a man
who though possessed of an over-
powering ambition fortunately lacks
the judgment necessary to attain his
ends.

For the agreement which seems at
this writing to end the suit to pre-
vent the publication of Manchester's
story creates more interest in the 1,-
600 words omitted than in the many
thousands that Look and Harper &
Row will sell to the public. So many
have seen the whole text and so ma-
ny copies of the unexpurgated edi-
tion are in existence that ultimately
everyone will know the whole story.
At this time in the proceedings
there appears on the stage a charac-
ter designated by Shakespeare as
"Rumor, painted full of tongues."
There appeared in the press all sorts
of guesses about what was in the ort-
ginal version, and there will be ver-
sions of the story printed abroad
that will have a profitable boot-
legged sale.
The public curiosity about the
Kennedy family still remains, three
years after the tragedy. As Walter
Bagehot wrote 90 years ago about
British interest in the monarchy:
"A family on the throne is an in-
teresting idea... It brings down
the pride of sovereignty to the level
of petty life... It introduces irrele-
vant facts into the business of
government..."
But a family so exalted must not
only do interesting things. It must
keep the respect of the beholders.
When it fails in that and makes mi-
stakes, it can lose respect overnight.
The spell is broken. And ribaldry
follows reverence.
In the weeks while this controver-
sy went on, public excitement ran
high and each day added something
to the alleged mystery. But, as al-
ways when the subject is based upon
irrelevancies, the reaction will be
quite sudden.
There will now follow what has
been called "the terrible sanity" of
an awakening. The public will
awake with a hangover of resent-
ment against all concerned. Com-
mon sense will suggest that the
great fuss was a mixture of emotion,
misunderstanding and speculation.
And the publications that follow
may be looking for purchasers.
President Johnson, the bystander,
will be the only one to escape
unscathed.
