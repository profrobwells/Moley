Eastern Misunderstandings
About the Situation at UC
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Some of the comments in the East
about the dismissal of Clark Kerr
from the presidency of the Univer-
sity of California have been a mix-
ture of panic, prejudice and misin-
formation.
President Nathan Pusey of Har-
vard speaks of "an affront to higher
education generally." And the New
York Times editorialized about "the
twilight of a great university."
Prejudice of a political nature is
expressed by the charge made by
Dr. Kerr himself, that behind the
dismissal were "right-wing radicals
in California." This is as prejudicial
a charge against a state as William
Manchester's implication that right-
wing elements in Dallas were re-
sponsible for President Kennedy's
assassination.
But misinformation is even more
regrettable. For the channels of
communication to California are
quite open. The pertinent facts, easi-
ly obtainable even at a distance, are
these:
Dr. Kerr's dismissal did not come,
as one account had it, with "shock-
ing suddenness." Opposition to Kerr
had been growing in the California
Board of Regents for more than two
years. It was the conviction of some
of the regents that Kerr's manage-
ment of the Berkeley disorders in
1964 had proved his inadequacy.
★
Lack of confidence in him in-
creased in the spring of 1965. At that
time he called a press conference to
announce his resignation, and only
five minutes before the news was
released he telephoned his intention
to the chairman of the Board of
Regents.
When the regents met after Dr.
Kerr's announcement, Gov. Edmund
G. Brown, who was present, argued
that the resignation be rejected.
Two members were swayed by this,
and no action was taken. That was
direct interference by a governor.
But now ex-Gov. Brown accuses
Gov. Ronald Reagan of political in-
terference, although the new gover-
nor did not initiate the dismissal. In
fact, he regretted that action was
precipitated at this time.
My information indicates that if
there had been a direct showdown
the regents would probably have
dismissed Kerr even before Reagan
was nominated and elected. Con-
fidence in Kerr's capacity as an
administrator had been ebbing for
more than two years.
The issue was drawn on Jan. 20,
1967, not by the regents, but by
Kerr, who asked to meet with the
chairman and the vice chairman of
the regents before the meeting of
the board. The chairman of the
regents, Theodore R. Meyer, has
stated that Kerr told them that "if
the question of his continuance in
office was likely to come up at any
board meeting in the near future he
thought the regents should face up
to it and decide it now one way or
the other."
Then, since there seemed to be a
clear majority for dismissal, the
chairman asked whether Kerr
would be willing to resign. Kerr
refused to do so and left the regents
no option, maintaining that they
must take the responsibility.
Kerr denies that he asked for a
vote of confidence. But Meyer stated
that whether it was a "vote of
confidence" or a "clarification of his
status" is "a question of semantics."
Gov. Reagan would have preferred
that the question of Kerr's status be
subordinated at that time to a con-
sideration of the budget and student
tuition.
Kerr had expressed willingness to
discuss budget cuts, but was ada-
mant against the tuition proposal.
★
As Gov. Reagan has informed the
state, there really is a fiscal emer-
gency. He believes that there can be
administrative economies. And his
proposal for a $400 tuition charge is
coupled with a plan that students
unable to pay might sign a note
payable in the future. The proposed
charge for tuition is quite reasona-
ble. It would tend, I believe, to cre-
ate a more responsible student body.
In the not inconsiderable time I
have spent in California I have
always been greatly impressed by
the state's zealous—not to say exces-
sive—interest in education. Outlays
for public education, especially
higher education, have been prodi-
gious. A high official in the state
recently told me that 40% of the
governor's budget
has been for edu-
cation.
But certain un-
deniable facts
point to the need
for economy.
Measured by a pro-
portion of the ap-
propriate age
group, more stu-
dents are enrolled
in the colleges and
universities of Cal-
ifornia than the national average.
But the proportion of dropouts is
also above the national average.
Professional salaries are high, and
the teaching load is low.
Certainly there can be a tightening
of the educational belt without im-
pairing high quality.
Finally, the East should under-
stand these facts. California is quite
capable of providing education with-
out transcontinental advice.
