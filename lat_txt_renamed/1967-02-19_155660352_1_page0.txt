A businessman whose company
serves the Washington government
in many ways commented the other
day that he could learn more about
the President's views on fiscal poli-
cy from chairman Ackley of the
Council of Economic Advisers than
from all the Cabinet members com-
bined.
In December a business-oriented
association secured Treasury Se-
cretary Henry H. Fowler as a fea-
tured speaker. But many of those
who heard him were disappointed
because his remarks conveyed very
little information about the present
and future course of fiscal policy.
The secretary either could not or
would not define administration pol-
icy. If he knew what Mr. Johnson
was planning, he was bound to
secrecy. If he did not know, it was
because he was not told. And even if
he knew the President's plans at the
time he delivered the address, he
was afraid the plans would be
changed.
All through history the influence
of the Cabinet as a Presidential
advisory body has depended largely
upon the character and disposition
of the President. Some Presidents
have deliberately chosen weak and
mediocre Cabinet members because
they wanted to keep the reins of
power in their own hands. The two
Roosevelts offer an interesting con-
trast.
â˜…
Roosevelt I had in his Cabinet
some of the most competent and
powerful men of their time. One
cannot imagine T. R. failing to soli-
cit and heed the advice of John Hay,
Elihu Root and William H. Taft. But
F.D.R. deliberately selected as mem-
bers of his Cabinet people he could
dominate or disregard.
President Eisenhower, on the oth-
er hand, secured the services of men
like John Foster Dulles, George
Humphrey, Charles Wilson, Robert
Anderson and Neil McElroy because
he respected and was willing to
follow their judgment.
But since 1961 a quite new order of
Presidential advisers has emerged.
These have been men who were
directly attached to the White
House and were housed therein.
There is little question that Mc-
George Bundy as a Presidential
assistant exercised more influence
over President Kennedy than did
Dean Rusk as secretary of state.
While Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in his
book after the President's death
violated the proprieties and ill
served the public interest by telling
of Mr. Kennedy's limited admiration
for and confidence in Rusk, there
can be little doubt about his truth-
fulness.
During the Kennedy Presidency,
in fact, the White House premises
were littered with Presidential advi-
sers who had more to do with shap-
ing policy than the Cabinet. And
this condition has prevailed under
President Johnson.
There are two reasons for this new
order in policy-making.
One is propinquity. The White
House staff is almost literally under
the President's nose. Policy is not
made at set times and in appointed
and publicized meetings. It is in the
making every working minute of
every day.
Another factor in the decline of
the Cabinet as an advisory body is
the preoccupation of the members
with their immense administrative
duties. All or most of their depart-
ments have grown almost beyond
recognition in the past 15 or 20
years. Some have grown almost be-
yond control.
In recent years Cabinet meetings
are attended by several more people
than the traditional department
heads. As the number that gathers
around the great table grows, there
is less and less chance for serious
weighing of general policies.
This shift of policy-making from
the Cabinet to the President and his
White House staff is one of the most
important facts in our national life.
