Flaws in the 25th Amendment
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since the cumbersome apparatus
of amending the Constitution was
invoked to settle two long-standing
questions about a President's disabi-
lity, it is a pity that a clear answer
has not been provided. Unless
certain language in the new amend-
ment is acted on by Congress
without delay, the 178-year-old
threat will remain.
The two questions are: Who is to
determine officially when a Pres-
ident is unable to perform the duties
of his office? And when and how is
his "inability" to be terminated?
★
Those questions are not answered
in Article II, Section 1 of the
Constitution.
The 25th Amendment, which is
supposed to provide new language
to answer the questions posed
above, says: "Whenever the Vice-
President and a majority of either
the principal officers of the execu-
tive departments or of such other
body as Congress may by law
provide transmit to the president
pro tempore of the Senate and the
speaker of the House of Represen-
tatives their written declaration
that the President is unable to
discharge the powers and duties of
his office, the Vice President shall
immediately assume the powers and
duties of the office as Acting
President."
★
The impracticality of this is that a
Vice President and the "principal
officers of the executive depart-
ments" are not likely to act in a case
such as President Wilson's incapaci-
ty in 1919, 1920 and 1921. For they
are the creatures of the President,
and he, despite his incapacity, could
in fact bar them from acting. At any
rate, they were not disposed to act
in the Wilson case.
The language would apparently
require the Vice President to join
in such a decision.
Perhaps, however, if Congress
should designate some other body,
the Vice President could be exclud-
ed from the decision. The question,
then, is what should be "such other
body"?
★
It might be Congress acting under
a rule of two-thirds majorities of
both houses. That might well in-
volve long debate and delay.
If the Supreme Court should be
designated by Congress as "such
other body," the court might not
accept the responsibility. For ever
since the case of Marbury vs.
Madison in Jefferson's first term,
the court has held to the position
that Congress cannot add to the
original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court.
Thus, to reach the Supreme Court
for decision, some individual or
body would have to institute a case
in the lower federal courts. Perhaps
that could be done by an individual
or by a committee of Congress.
★
The last paragraph of the 25th
Amendment provides for a method
by which the "inability" of the
President shall be terminated. It
says that the President himself shall
take the initiative and that he shall
resume the duties of his office
unless—and then substantially the
same language follows that provides
for determining the disability.
Thus, a President seeking to
resume the duties of his office would
be subject to a veto. But such a veto
by Congress is limited by certain
language relating to time and so on.
And it is clear that Congress could
not resolve the issue unless it had
previously provided for "such other
body."
What is clear is that Congress
should now enact legislation to clear
up the messy language that it
decided to incorporate in the 25th
Amendment.
