The GOP Apple of Discord
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It was not even a golden apple. It
was a gnarled, worm-eaten speci-
men. But it has foreshadowed a
division in the GOP which may well
endanger its chances of success in
1968. It may shatter the unity
among Republicans which has been
created by intelligent leaders at all
levels.
It was the dove-like report on
Vietnam by the staff of the GOP
Senate Policy Committee which was
released last week.
Certain questions about this report
have been only partially answered:
Why was a mere staff of the
Republican Senate Policy Com-
mittee permitted to compose a
statement of GOP party policy? Who
asked that such a report be written?
Did the Senate members of the
committee read this report before it
was released? Who authorized its
release? And what encouragement
will such a report (originally identi-
fied as a statement of the committee
itself) give to our enemies in the war
in Vietnam?
Sen. Karl Mundt, a member of the
committee, stated that the report
was written because of a motion by
Sen. Jacob. Javits. Mundt says he
seconded the motion because he
believed that it merely called for
historical facts about the origins of
our commitment in Vietnam and
that it would in no way state what
GOP policy should be.
But Javits in the same discussion
in the Senate not only heartily
supported the report, but made it
clear that it agreed with his own
dove-like sentiments about future
policy. The report also received the
hearty endorsement of. Sen.. J. W.
Fulbright, the valiant opponent of
the President's position in the war.
Even a casual reading of the
report confirms the belief that it
was intended to be a statement of
Republican policy.
The chairman of the Policy
Committee, Sen. Bourke Hicken-
looper, admitted that he had author-
ized the release of the report. He
also confessed that he had not read
it before permitting its release. This
was a strange use of his authority.
Hickenlooper said he had released
the report because he had feared
there would be a "leak." Who did he
suspect would produce the "leak"? A
member of the committee or the
staff?

Was it Javits? In his statement in
the Senate, Javits indicated he not
only had had access to the report,
but had read it and heartily relished
its contents.
The sentiments in the report have
been strenuously repudiated by Sen.
John Tower and House Minority
Leader Gerald Ford. Sen. Everett
Dirksen, a member of the Policy
Committee, engaged in a bit of
double-talk. He believed that the
report would be helpful, but he also
affirmed his support of the Pres-
ident. Possibly, since he was ill in
the hospital, he had not seen the
report before he spoke.
It remained for a Democrat and
supporter of President Johnson's
war policy, Sen. Gale McGee, to
expose the report for what it is. He
pointed out that it is not a full
historical report. The basic justifica-
tion for our presence in Vietnam is
in the SEATO treaty, negotiated by
a Republican administration and
"resoundingly" approved by the
Senate.
*
The report only casually mentions
SEATO. McGee quoted President
Eisenhower's interpretation of the
treaty in 1957 and 1959, when he
said that our "national interests"
demanded military strength suffici-
ent to protect South Vietnam. Fi-
nally, McGee also quoted Gen. Ei-
senhower's statement in 1967:
"America doesn't need to apologize
for her part in the war . . . I hope
America will wake up to the fact
that our soldiers are dying for
something they can believe in."
This, with the repeated statements
of Republican leaders, places Sen.
Javits in a small corner of dissent.
And he has the effrontery to believe
that the GOP will select him in 1968
as a candidate for Vice President.
