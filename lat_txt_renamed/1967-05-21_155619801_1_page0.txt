Why a Lunar Landing?
Money Has Better Uses
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems ever so long ago. It was in
the golden spring of 1961, when
Camelot was young and gay. But a
chill came over the castle with the
news of the dreadful blunder of the
Bay of Pigs. And so they all sat at
the round table and talked about
how to patch a rent in the robe
called Prestige.
Someone remembered that certain
scientists had been talking for years
about putting a man on the moon
and then getting him back to earth
safely. This, it was agreed by all the
knights, would induce people to
forget about the Bay of Pigs.
It would also excite people's
sporting instincts because it would
no doubt arouse the interest of the
Soviets in getting there first.
Someone said it would cost a lot of
money, but the professors assured
the chieftains that the "new" eco-
nomics would care for that.
And so President Kennedy announced in May that "before this
decade is out" we
would land a man
on the moon and
bring him back
safely to earth.
When the question was asked
why we should go
to the moon, he
offered the quote
attributed to
Mallory, who died
trying to climb
Everest: "Because
it is there." And he told the people
in Houston how much money would
go to the industries and communities concerned.
Thus, several objectives beckoned:
a new, glittering plan to beat the
Russians in a sporting event of
cosmic magnitude; the restoration of
the Kennedy image of "getting
moving" again, and also vague
considerations of some unspecified
military advantage in case of war.
Moreover, the plan provided a
public works project infinitely
greater than the building of the
pyramids of Egypt or the Gothic
renaissance in France in the 12th
century.
But practical problems multiplied,
and Mr. Kennedy tacitly confessed
two months before his death that
the project was too big for one
nation. He suggested a joint effort
with the Russians.
Khrushchev blandly said that
the Soviet Union was content to let
the United States spend the money
and get the glory. But when
Khrushchev said anything in those
days, it was the habit of our
administration to conclude that the
opposite was true.
When Lyndon Johnson became
President he enthusiastically gave
the green light to the lunar project.
It had been a special province of his
while he was Vice President. And so
it has gone on, absorbing since its
initiation the first few of the estimated $23 billion it will cost.
In 1964 Edwin Diamond published
a richly informative book, "The Rise
and Fall of the Space Age." Here,
fortified by plenty of research,
Diamond said that when Mr. Kennedy made his announcement in
1961 he had little or no knowledge of
the several lunar plans, each one
with its deadly critics, and no real
scheme had been agreed upon by
the official people concerned.

When President Kennedy's offer
to co-operate with the Russians was
"extemporized," he spoke without
any meaningful consultation with
his experts about how co-operation
was possible. Dr. Robert R. Gilruth,
who was the director of the center
where astronauts were being
trained for the lunar program, said
he couldn't see how a joint program
could be worked out. There were
enough difficulties, he said, with
American contractors "who all
speak the same language."
More than three years have passed
since John Kennedy's offer was
made. Meanwhile, we have become
embroiled in a desperately critical
and expensive war, the end of which
no one can foresee. This will cost
almost as much in a single year as
the lunar project will in the years
remaining until 1970. The civil
rights movement and other needs
will demand billions in urban improvements. And it may be that
federal deficits will run next year to
$18 billion.
Finally, there are the tragic
reminders of defective construction
that cost the lives of three of our
astronauts at Cape Kennedy and the
killing of Komarov, the Russian,
because of a technical malfunction.

But the dream is still on the
drawing boards. A publication of
North American Aviation, Inc.
called "Apollo Training" shows in
detail what the present plans call
for. A study of these plans shows
that what has been done in space up
to now is primitive when compared
with the final proposed lunar flight.
To expect this to operate even
without limitation within this decade is highly doubtful. But on the
present timetable it would be absurd.
The value of such an adventure is
still obscure. For there are plans for
unmanned flights which will yield
all the pertinent information we
want about the moon's surface.
There are better ways in the years
ahead to spend our money and our
skills. These include scientific exercises more constructive than those
connected with the lunar project.
