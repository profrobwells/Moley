'Candidate-Watching' the GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A vigorous old man addressing a
group in his own age bracket
recently assured his listeners that,
while they were too old for girl
watching, there still remained bird
watching which they could enjoy
without leaving their back yards.
Commentators in a dull political
year like this must content them-
selves with an equally effortless
exercise, GOP candidate watching.
Generally I avoid speculation about
candidates because unforeseen cir-
cumstances in the coming 13 months
will provide the only reliable an-
swer. But since I am confronted
with this subject almost every day, a
bit of speculation may be in order.
Much of the talk about Republican
plans for 1968 centers upon Richard
Nixon. The opinion is widespread,
as it was in the case of Robert A.
Taft in 1952, that Nixon has fine
qualifications, but that he cannot be
elected. He is, "they" say, twice
defeated and shopworn.
It is likely, however, that the
doubts about his capacity to defeat
President Johnson may considera-
bly lessen when later this year he
draws upon his observations in
Europe, Asia and Latin America for
a series of speeches. It is possible to
anticipate that what he says may
provide a viable program for opposi-
tion for a GOP which seems to need
it. That will assure Nixon of the
respect and allegiance due a leader.
For none of the other potentials
seems to have the experience and
knowledge for such leadership.
Doubts arising from Nixon's two
defeats are answered by his support-
ers in part by an appeal to history.
In recent times Grover Cleveland,
William Jennings Bryan and
Thomas Dewey were defeated in
elections, but still grasped the
nomination in another year. Cleve-
land, of course, was the only one to
be elected after a defeat.
Nixon was defeated in 1960 by a
very narrow margin. And if there
had been a fair count of votes in
Illinois, Missouri and Texas, John
Kennedy could not have won.
A great deal of the Goldwater
support, including that of the for-
mer candidate himself, is for Nixon.
But if George Wallace of Alabama
runs, no GOP candidate can win the
Southern tier of states won by Gold-
water in 1964.
Since we are speaking here of the
nomination, however, it is not
unlikely that Nixon can have the
delegates from those states in the
South and the border that nominat-
ed Goldwater in 1964, with the
exception of Texas and Florida,
which have favorite sons.

Among the dedicated conserva-
tives who still believe that the issues
of 1964 deserve another trial in 1968
there is a great deal of talk about
Gov. Ronald Reagan. But Reagan
might well note the decision of Earl
Warren in 1944 when he, like
Reagan, was in the middle of his
first term as governor. Dewey,
assured of the Presidential nomina-
tion, asked Warren to run for Vice-
President. Warren answered that if
he were on the ticket the people of
California would vote to keep him
home and on the job as governor.
It is almost inconceivable that
Gov. George Romney, despite his
elaborate organization, could win a
nomination from a convention that
will have a considerable number of
the same people who nominated
Goldwater in 1964.
At the moment, the only formi-
dable rival with whom Nixon must
reckon is Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
Despite Rockefeller's disavowals
and his support of Romney, he will
be a choice of many delegates
impressed by his success in winning
re-election in 1966, his ambitious
state programs this year and the
support of the powerful and wealthy
Eastern establishment.
Looming on the horizon are
several potential compromises like
Sen. Charles Percy. But wise dele-
gates will recall the fate of dark
horses in the past. They look fine
until they meet the test in a
campaign against a real profession-
al. And such a tough, seasoned
professional is Lyndon B. Johnson.
