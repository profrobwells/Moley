Senate Bill 1160, entitled The
Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, has
passed the Senate and is now before
the House. This bill, if enacted,
would thrust the heavy foot of the
federal government, which means
always a political government, ever
farther into the door of public edu-
cation.
It is an extension of the Edu-
cation Television Facilities Act
of 1962, which provided grants
matched with the states on a 50-50
basis. Under S. 1160 the federal
government would pay 75% of such
grants, and for that outlay it would
authorize $10.5 million in 1968.
Beyond that for four years the
federal subsidy would probably
increase progressively.
As always with federal grants,
there would be additional federal
bureaucracy. For the bill would set
up a federal corporation governed
by a board of 15 members. Nine of
these would be appointed by the
President and six by the President's
appointees.
In the rush of unfinished business
there seems to have been little
consideration of the potential mis-
chief in this proposed legislation.
Much of this federal subsidy for
educational television would pro-
bably be channeled through an
organization called the National
Education Television network, a
liberally oriented outfit which man-
ufactures programs and offers them
to some 130 educational TV stations.
Under new rulings of the FCC, new
channels are allocated to ETV and
would ultimately serve 600 stations.
I suggest that if the federal
government should propose such a
subsidized arrangement to supply
editorials and features to newspa-
pers there would be a tremendous
outcry about freedom of the press.
But this reach into a similar
medium of communication differs
only in method, not substance.
The report on the bill by Sen. John
Pastore's (D-R.I.) subcommittee
raises a very important question of
principle. It says that "the airways
themselves over which programs
are broadcast are public property."
They are, it says further, "natural
resources."
But there is a vital difference
between natural resources owned by
the public and natural resources
owned by the government. The
earth and all it contains belongs to
the people who inhabit it, and so
does the air over the earth. The
government, however, does not have
title of ownership.
The role of government, except
under socialism or communism, is to
make sure that some of the people
do not unjustly exploit resources
belonging to all of the people. Under
our free society private agencies
develop such resources under regu-
lations imposed by the government.
Government ownership and oper-
ation is constitutionally limited. The
proof of this principle is that private
development has been not only
much more efficient than govern-
ment ownership, but more benefi-
cial to the people. True, there are
monopolies to be considered. Here
government by long experience
serves best as a regulator, not an
operator. Consider the relative ef-
ficency and progressive nature of
the telephone system as compared
with the Post Office.
This principle applies with special
emphasis to the airwaves over
which the people learn so much of
the news and by a process of
selection shape their opinions. For
in the area of communications, a
very sensitive nerve is touched.
