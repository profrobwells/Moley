Self-Defeating 'Freedom' Hunt
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In 1945 when New York's Mayor
Fiorello La Guardia was nearing the
end of his third and final term of
office, he conceived the idea that he
wanted to be a professor of munici-
pal government at Columbia Univer-
sity.
He spoke to a friend who was on
the board of trustees of that institu-
tion, who in turn consulted the
chairman of the board. That gentle-
man exclaimed that any suggestion
emanating from the trustees about
an appointment of a professor would
raise a great, public protest and
come to nothing.
And so the trustee, who was also
my friend, asked me to "sound out"
the professors in the department of
which I was still a semi-active
member about a La Guardia ap-
pointment. I did so and reported to
the trustee that the appointment
was unthinkable.
I tell this story now (the main
participants are all dead) to illus-
trate the relations which existed
even as long ago as that between the
trustees and the faculty.
Nearly three decades before, Co-
lumbia's President Nicholas Murray
Butler and the trustees had dis-
missed three members of the facul-
ty. In protest, the famous Prof.
Charles A. Beard resigned. After
that, the frightened trustees re-
nounced any voice in appointments
promotions, and Butler generally
followed faculty recommendations.
In many other aspects of universi-
ty administration the trustees and
administrative officers of Columbia,
and of most other great private
universities as well, have pursued a
policy that rejected any suggestion
of leadership. Faculty control was
regarded as substantially complete.
It has been said that the administra-
tive officers were relegated to the
tasks of bringing in the cash and
cutting the grass.
At Columbia President Butler
reigned supreme for more than 30
years. He not only made university
policy and maintained order, but he
brought in the cash. In the final
years of his 44-year presidency,
however, failing vitality reduced
him to merely nominal leadership.
After his resignation there was an
acting interim president for three
years.
Then the trustees selected Dwight
D. Eisenhower, believing that with
the great prestige of the general the
purse strings of prospective donors
would be loosened.
But the general looked upon his
new office as a quiet place for retire-
ment and rejected any suggestion
that the president of a university
was there to raise money. And his
ties to the military first took him off
to Washington for advisory services
and later to Paris as head of NATO.
Then there followed Grayson Kirk,
who has served as president of
Columbia until now.
Thus, a long succession of weak
administrations has brought Co-
lumbia to rather critical straits.
In ways somewhat less dramatic
than at Columbia, the same decline
in administrative authority has ta-
ken place in many institutions of
higher learning. First the faculty
and now the students have demand-
ed administrative control for them-
selves. There is something grossly
inconsistent in this movement
among faculties and students. For in
the same breath they protest against
authority in the name of freedom
and at the same time have nothing
to offer as a substitute.
It is difficult to see how any
institution can get the money for
expansion, maintain reasonable or-
der and discipline and provide
educational leadership if it is to be
denied competent and forceful admi-
nistrative personnel.
This ferment among so-called in-
tellectuals for complete freedom can-
not but dry up the sources from
which the intellectual life of the
nation is nourished. Faculties as
well as students should realize that
much of what they are demanding is
too high a price to pay for what they
call freedom.
