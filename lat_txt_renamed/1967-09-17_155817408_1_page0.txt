The Circularity of Revolutions
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This writer is neither a China-
hand nor a more-than-casual China-
watcher. What I know of the
convulsions of Chairman Mao Tse-
tung's empire is from sources gener-
ally available. And since Britain's ox
is now being gored, the best ac-
counts are in the London press.
But long study of and reflections
on political evolution provide what
may be called the anatomy—and in
this instance, the pathology—of
revolutionary movements.
Real revolutions, unlike our
American Revolution, involve
wholesale political, economic and
social change. They pass through
three main phases. The first, if
successful, destroys the traditional
power structure and causes the
death or exile of the people in
control. In the second phase the
revolutionary forces turn on them-
selves in a struggle for power. The
itch for power is disguised by
charges of counterrevolution or, in
Communist terms, "deviation." Fi-
nally, in the chaos or the uneasy
hegemony that emerges, the people
generally respond to inherited ha-
bits. And traditional, prerevolution-
ary patterns of life reappear.
I pick the best-known examples
from the bulging wallet of history.
The French Revolution passed
through the three phases in a few
years. The four years from 1789 to
1793 marked the liquidation or exile
of the nobility. In the single year of
the Terror, 1793, the guillotine
began by chopping off the heads of
aristocrats and ended in beheading
earlier masters of the revolution.
Then the old patterns reappeared
with Napoleon's coronation in 1804
and the restoration of the Bourbons
in 1815.
In Russia the first phase ended
with the death of Lenin. The
struggle for power ended in the
uneasy dominance of Stalin. Then,
with the liberal borrowings of
technology and industrial adapta-
tions, the present state of commerci-
al coexistence came about.
The clash between Russia and
China is due, among other factors, to
the fact that Russia is in the third
phase of revolution; Mao's regime is
in the second. This is suggested in
an article by Joseph J. Baritz in the
September "Proceedings" of the
U.S. Naval Institute. (Baritz held
various offices in the Soviet Union
until he crossed into West Berlin in
1947.) He says:
"Every revolution has a more or
less extended period of momentum
during the course of which its
pathos, enthusiasm, spirit and dyna-
mism play a significant role in the
formation of the domestic and
foreign policies of the country. This
is the 'childhood disease' period of
revolution.
"Mao and his generation of revolu-
tionaries are still infected with the
virus of dynamism and permanent
revolution. Moreover, the 'revision-
ism' of the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe and the failure of
Chinese subversive activities in
Africa and Asia inspired the Chinese
to create a revolutionary atmos-
phere within China itself so that the
revolution would not lose its
momentum. In order to accomplish
this end, they fell back on the
traditional methods of the masses.

"In addition, China at its present
stage of economic development does
not have the industrial, technical or
financial means to extend its politi-
cal influence to the lesser-developed
countries, as does the Soviet Union.
Therefore, the single remaining
avenue of approach is to preach
fanaticism in the 'national liberation
movements' and revolutionary
wars."
A friend of mine who has been a
China-watcher since he first entered
business in Japan in 1947 predicts
that within a year China will resort
to something like the old prerevolu-
tionary pattern—a collection of pro-
vinces dominated by their local
"warlords."
As this goes on, China will lose
whatever capacity it had for war
against either Russia or the United
States. In its external affairs it will
have less and less capacity to export
its horrid ideological brew. Even in
ideology there are differences over
method which intensify the internal
struggle. China for centuries was
governed from provincial centers.
That is a way of life which her
masses understand because it is
traditional and because, in a fashion,
it worked.
