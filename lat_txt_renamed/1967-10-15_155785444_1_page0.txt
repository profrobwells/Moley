Wrongness of Public Strikes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the strike of New York City's
teachers had been no more than a
short disruption of a big school
system, it would not be worth
retrospective comment.
But it was a symptom of the
epidemic of disobedience to law
which we must realize is breaking
out in many places and in many
forms. It goes by the name "civil"
disobedience, which is designed to
make the violation of law a noble
and praiseworthy act.
In refusing to honor their contrac-
tual obligations and resume their
duties, thousands of teachers were
violating a state law and a court
order.
The statement of Justice Emilio
Nunez, reviewing the facts in the
case and pronouncing judgement, is
a document worthy of study by
anyone who is concerned about our
present discontents.
The Board of Education obtained
an injunction against the strike
before the appointed day for open-
ing the schools. This was under the
terms of the Taylor Act, which
applies to all government employes
in the state of New York. The Taylor
Act was passed in 1967 and sup-
planted an earlier statute, the
Condon-Wadlin Act.
After the teachers' union members
(and others) failed to return to their
schools, the board sought remedial
action for contempt before Justice
Nunez, who fined the union $150,000
and sentenced the leader of the
union, Albert Shanker, to 15 days
imprisonment and a fine of $250.
The Taylor Act, like its predeces-
sor, rests upon an established policy
at federal, state and local levels.
Justice Nunez put that principle in
these words: "... neither labor-
the public employe-nor manage-
ment-the government agency-in
their mutual interdependence can
afford the indulgence of arbitrary
self-interest at the expense of the
public."
In 1953, in signing the Condon-
Wadlin Act, Gov. Thomas E. Dewey
clearly defined the basic reason for
the prohibition:
"... Every liberty enjoyed in this
nation exists because it is protected
by a government which functions
uninterruptedly. The paralysis of
any portion of government could
quickly lead to the paralysis of all
society. Paralysis of government is
anarchy, and in anarchy liberties
become useless."

Dewey, always a precisionist, used
the word "liberty" rather than
"freedom." For in principle, liberty
must be distinguished from free-
dom. "Liberty," which is Latin, not
Teutonic in origin, implies the
capacity within itself for its own
protection and a coercive power to
create an environment favorable to
those who possess it. George Santay-
ana noted, "Freedom from want
and fear is only a condition of the
steady exercise of true liberty. On
the other hand, it demands insur-
ance and protection by provident
institutions."
But in these days, makers of
opinion, assured by distinguished
leaders in society, are inciting
lawlessness by practicing what they
call "civil" disobedience. The mass
of people, including the unthinking
and vicious, do not understand the
word "civil." But they do know what
disobedience means.
Consider the preachings of Willi-
am Sloan Coffin Jr., chaplain of Yale
University. In a debate with former
Supreme Court Justice Charles E.
Whittaker, he said that "We must
obey God rather than man." And
since God does not speak in the
present context, everyone must,
according to Coffin, decide for
himself what God directs him to do.
The outcome is anarchy.
The irony in the action of New
York City's teachers is that they are
the very people who teach civil
government and obedience to law to
the citizens of tomorrow.
