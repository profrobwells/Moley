Health Institutes Demonstrate
How Riches Can Produce Waste
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In domestic affairs President
Johnson acts on the principle—if it
be called a principle—that any ill in
our society can be cured by throwing
a lot of money at it. If its
existence is widely known, doing a
lot about it is therefore productive
of popularity and votes. Unlike his
circumspection in foreign affairs, his
action on the domestic front is
compulsive and lavish.
The President’s routine is to
deplore the social ill, recommend a
lot of money, get Congress to make
the appropriation and dump the
money on the bureaucracy. And you
may be sure that the bureaucrats
love to spend it.
That has been his method in
providing for what are called the
National Institutes of Health with
the many offices devoted to giving
grants for medical research.
President Kennedy, no doubt
guided by a fairly prudent Secretary
Abraham Ribicoff
of Health, Education,
and Welfare,
in his first budget
recommended an
appropriation of
$583,400,000. The
Johnson budgets
since then have
jumped to $1,425,-
700,000. And we
shall soon see
what the figure
will be for the fiscal
year 1969.

No government service can grow
so much and so soon without great
waste. And this one is no exception.
Over and over, congressional committees
have complained about the
waste in spending this money. As
far back as 1961, the House Committee
on Government Operations, after
a two-year study, found major
weaknesses in NIH and made recommendations
which even officials
in the agency agreed should be acted
upon. The next year the committee
found little improvement.
In 1965 a special presidential
committee found that NIH, under
pressure to spend and spend, had
little time to correct bad management
practices. And as late as
October, 1967, the Government
Operations Committee concluded
that NIH had made “relatively little
effort to improve its administration
of grants.” But Sen. Lister Hill,
chairman of the Senate subcommittee
on appropriations for the agency,
has in effect accused critics of
not wanting to save lives. And in 14
out of 16 budgets the Senate under
Hill’s prodding has increased the
President’s request.
In all Washington and in almost every section of the country there is
no more powerful lobby than the
one that is pressing for more and
more appropriations for the NIH. In
the current Atlantic Monthly there
is an informative article by Elizabeth
Brenner Drew entitled “The
Health Syndicate.” The author describes
the growing power in that
lobby of the Lasker Foundation, in
which the moving spirit is Mrs.
Mary Lasker.
That lady, armed with plenty of
private, tax-exempt funds, is most
influential with President Johnson
and the senators and congressmen
responsible for health appropriations.
In the “team” operating the
lobby are a number of doctors
skilled in the art of political pressure.
To be sure, the NIH lobby operates
in the noble interests of humanity.
Who can possibly be against eradicating
the killer diseases that afflict
mankind?
Congressional committees have
used the words “inept,” “inadequate”
and “surprising laxity” in
reviewing every aspect of NIH
management. For instance, one organization
was overpaid almost
$500,000 which has still not been
recovered. A five-year, $23-million
commitment was made “without
first developing workable methods
for the comprehensive scientific and
administrative review” of the whole
program. That opened the way for
the research institution to finance
programs the NIH had disapproved.
Grants to Health Science Awards
have been made without open
competition.

Despite the urgency for basic
research in the killer diseases, there
is a limit to the number of scientists
who can be employed and supported.
It ill serves the purposes of
research to underwrite an increasing
number of grants to those who
have neither skill nor adequate
plans.
Moreover, such profligate giving
impairs the effectiveness of teaching
in medical schools. Dr. W. C.
Davison, former dean of the Duke
University medical school, said in
1963: “With grants for research
projects, research facilities, research
training, research equipment, research
personnel and for anything
in any way, shape or form, so long as
it is for research, the central
educational function of medical
schools has been seriously distorted.”
Prudent management of such huge
funds is what is gravely needed. For
sometimes there may be too much
for a good purpose.
