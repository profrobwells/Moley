Much Can Be Said Against
Restrictions on Travel
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I learn from people in the immense
travel industry that the first reac-
tion to the President's unhappy New
Year's message to the people was a
flurry of reservations for travel
abroad. They say that the same
reaction greeted the President's plea
to restrict foreign travel two years
ago.
The motives for such a negative
reaction were undoubtedly mixed.
Many were probably moved to
protest against the authoritarian
mood of the President, for a lot of
disobedience is abroad in the land
and this threat to freedom has
seemed unjust and uncalled for.
More perceptive people may know
that such a method of stemming the
gold drain is like building a dike of
loose sticks.
Some interesting figures on that
point were presented in Travel
Weekly, a major publication of the
industry. The government's guess—
and it is no more than a guess at this
time—is that the so-called "travel
deficit" for 1967 was $2 billion, more
than half of the U.S. balance-of-
payments deficit. Exact figures are
not available. However, in 1965,
when this subject came up before,
the American Express Co. broke
down the "travel deficit" figure of
$1.7 billion this way:
*
"1—Transportation deficit, U.S.
residents paid more to foreign
carriers than foreign residents paid
to U.S. flag carriers. Total, $500
million plus. Omitted from this
technical deficit, however, were:
foreign spending for U.S. aircraft,
$250 million; expenditures in the
U.S. by foreign governments and
carriers, $165 million.
"2—Canada-Mexico travel deficit.
$335 million. Close relationships and
trade surpluses dictate that these
nations continue to earn travel
surpluses.
"3—Europe-Mediterranean travel
deficit, $680 million. But of this total
54% goes for business, scientific,
educational and other serious purpo-
ses.
"4—Pleasure travel deficit to Eu-
ropean and Mediterranean coun-
tries, $315 million."
It should be added that those
dollars for pleasure provide many
benefits to the American economy
and permit many countries to buy
U.S.-made goods.
A great many arguments have
been made against the President's
proposal, some of them originating
in the justified self-interest of the
travel industry. The arguments
include the edict of the U.S. Su-
preme Court when it decided
against the State Department's refu-
sal to grant passports to two
American Communists. Justice Ar-
thur J. Goldberg, speaking for the
majority, said that the court in 1958
had said that the right to travel
abroad "is an important aspect of
the citizen's liberty" guaranteed by
the Fifth Amendment. Justice Willi-
am O. Douglas in 1958 classed the
right to travel with the right of
assembly and of association—"the
very essence of a free society."
But we may dismiss these theories
of personal liberty. For a sovereign
nation has a duty to protect itself in
an emergency—if there be an emer-
gency.
The two real arguments against
such restrictions as Mr. Johnson
may ask Congress to impose are
these:
Any monetary penalty on travel
would bear heavily only upon
people of limited means such as
teachers and students. The well-to-
do would pay with no trouble at all.
The second valid reason was
mentioned by a former high official
in the Treasury Department. He
said that such restrictions as are
proposed would be practically unen-
forceable. Many would go to Europe
or the Far East via Canada. There is
also the difficulty of distinguishing
between travel for pleasure and
travel for business. Many could
allege some business objective and
tie it in with plenty of pleasure.
Above all there is the overriding
fact that the plight of the dollar is
caused by extravagant spending by
government. The President sees
only the mote in the citizen's eye
and ignores the beam in his own.
