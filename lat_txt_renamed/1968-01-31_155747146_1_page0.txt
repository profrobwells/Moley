Frankfurter and Flattery
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If Felix Frankfurter had respected
the independence of the Supreme
Court as much as he said he did, he
would not have written most of the
letters and telegrams now published
with commentary by Max Freedman
in "Roosevelt & Frankfurter: Their
Correspondence, 1928-1945" (Little,
Brown). For they portray a man
winning a place on the court by
lavishly flattering the President
who had the power to appoint him
and then, securely seated on the
bench, a judge continuously meddling
in executive affairs.
And if Frankfurter had cherished
the reputation he made on the court
after President Roosevelt died, he
would not, as an old retired justice,
have permitted the publication of
this correspondence for years to
come. But he was apparently proud
of the power and influence he had
exercised for years.
*
The result is a book which may not
enhance the reputation of its two
principal characters but will be
immensely useful as a text for
people interested in the wiles and
ways of palace politics. The text is
80-85% Frankfurter and Freedman,
and the rest the restrained responses
of Mr. Roosevelt.
It has become quite generally
known that, in his private capacity
as an intimate of men in power,
Frankfurter was a most active
provider of jobs for his friends and
proteges. Those appointees included
a score of lawyer-assistants for
Justices Holmes and Brandeis and
literally hundreds of young men in
government offices.
There is space here for comment
on only two features in Freedman's
book which, even considering my
own closeness to what happened in
those years, were news to me. One
had to do with Frankfurter's part in
Mr. Roosevelt's court-packing fight
in 1937 and the other with Frankfurter's
appointment to the Supreme
Court. The two, as is shown in the
correspondence, were interrelated.
No doubt Frankfurter long nourished
an ambition to serve on the
court as well as his eagerness to
influence public policy and official
personnel.
But a crisis came when Mr.
Roosevelt proposed his court-packing
plan in February, 1937. This was
a shock to Frankfurter, for some
years earlier he had written in
opposition to the enlargement of the
court to influence the course of its
decisions. And so he decided to
observe public neutrality.
Mr. Roosevelt agreed to this public
position of Frankfurter because, as
Freedman says, the President, told
Frankfurter, apparently by telephone,
that he "intended one day to
put him on the Supreme Court and
did not want him entangled in this
particular controversy." In a letter
marked "Privatissimo," however, he
asked Frankfurter to supply him
with arguments to be used in his
speeches supporting the plan. To
this request Frankfurter copiously
and privately responded.
That was practical politics at the
highest level. And even Freedman
says with honest candor, but probably
with regret, "There is a great
deal wrong, however, with being a
secret partisan while wearing the
disguise of public neutrality."
Here I wish to add something that
Freedman did not know when he
wrote his commentary.
*
At least two years before 1937 Mr.
Roosevelt told me that he intended
to appoint Frankfurter to the Supreme
Court, and I immediately told
Frankfurter of this prospect.
In 1937, at his home in Cambridge,
I told Frankfurter that I understood
the reason for his neutrality, and he
made no direct response. Of course, I
meant that the reason was his
expectation of the appointment.
According to Freedman, "Frankfurter
never expected to be appointed
to the vacancy of the Supreme
Court created by the death of Mr.
Justice Cardozo in July, 1938." This
is a rather strange assumption, since
there were at least two expressions
of President Roosevelt's intention,
and one of these was coupled with
his invitation to be publicly neutral
and privately helpful in the controversy.
The tone of the long correspondence
is marked by the effusive
flattery of the President by his
friend. Freedman notes: "He was an
artist in adulation; and sometimes,
forgetting the artistry, he laid on
flattery with a trowel."
But F.F. knew his man. Mr.
Roosevelt loved it.
