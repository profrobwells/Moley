Danger in Social Services
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The inspiration which led to our
adoption of a system of old-age
pensions in the mid-1930s came from
Lloyd George's national insurance
legislation 15 years before. In 1919
the famous Welsh chancellor of the
exchequer proposed a "war budget"
against poverty, saying that poverty
would become as extinct as "the
wolves that once infested our
forests" if his reforms were adopted.
The vast proliferation of "social
services" which followed in the
years since has largely created the
crisis now faced by the United
Kingdom. For in the process of
alleviating individual poverty, suc-
cessive governments over there
have impoverished the nation.
And now, before we go too far, we
might once more learn a lesson from
the plight of Prime Minister Harold
Wilson's government.
I select as a text the growth over
30 years of the program we call Old
Age, Survivors and Disability Insur-
ance (OASDI).
There has been time since the
revision of this system was enacted
in 1937 to study come of its
implications. The collections re-
quired to meet the increased bene-
fits will be $40 billion in 1972. In
1965 only $17 billion was required.

Since under present laws these
sums must come from payroll taxes
on workers and their employers, a
combined tax of 11% will be needed.
But even with that increase in the
tax there are grave misgivings in
Congress about bringing income and
outgo into balance for this program.
There is a major contradiction in
this system. One objective is to
provide material benefits for people
who presumably are incapable of
self-support. The fancy name for
this is "social adequacy." In other
words, it is federal welfare.
The other objective as originally
planned is to provide a sort of
insurance into which payments are
enforced from workers and employ-
ers in equal amounts. The hope was
that this equity would in time
provide pensions for the workers
and/or their survivors at retirement
age. The fancy name for this is
"individual equity," i.e., insurance.
The dilemma faced by the govern-
ment is that if social adequacy is
maintained by progressive increases
in benefits, the time when indivi-
dual equity will be reached will be
more and more remote.
And some time before that, young
workers will come to realize that the
proportion of what they are paying
in Social Security taxes on their
earnings would, if otherwise invest-
ed in private insurance or private
pension systems, yield more at
retirement than what the govern-
ment will pay. It is probable, also,
that everyone will come to realize
that the books of the present system
cannot be kept in balance.

When that day of reckoning
comes, the political pressure of the
younger workers will demand some
reconciliation of the two contradic-
tory objectives of the system.
Congress in the 1967 legislation
tried to postpone that moment of
truth by shifting more of the burden
from the lower-paid workers to the
more fortunate by raising the maxi-
mum taxable wage from $6,000 to
$7,800. But this will be only a
temporary alleviation. And so there
is growing sentiment in Congress
and elsewhere to provide a subsidy
for the system out of the general
revenues of the government.
The political argument for such a
subsidy is that it will be an
inconspicuous item when it is buried
in the vast aggregation of welfare
expenditures already committed.
And the logic is that since the care
of the elderly is a national responsi-
bility, the cost should be paid by all
taxpayers rather than by those who
are paying payroll taxes. This
proposal may well be debated when
the next round of rising benefits
comes in 1970.
