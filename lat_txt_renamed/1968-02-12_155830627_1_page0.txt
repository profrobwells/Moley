'Peace' Negotiations---the
Communist Way of Strife
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Most Americans, except the few
who have been directly involved,
fail to realize how Communists turn
any form of negotiation to their
advantage. Friedrich Nietzsche, the
German philosopher, said something
to the effect that a good war justifies
any cause. To the Communist, any
subject or event which can lead to
negotiation is a blessing. For it
permits Communists to engage in
dialectic, and dialectic is their way
of life.
On television we have heard and
seen U.N. Ambassador Arthur Gold-
berg engage in Security Council
debates with Soviet representatives,
first about the crisis in the Middle
East and more recently about the
Pueblo affair. It is as if the
contestants were speaking different
languages out of two different
civilizations. All the ground rules
are unlike.
The American is a lawyer follow-
ing the precepts of Anglo-Saxon
jurisprudence. With him, rules of
evidence prevail, and the effort is to
bring the argument down to the few
issues of fact which are in dispute.
The Communist is not addressing a
tribunal with the power of decision.
He seeks to avoid a judgment on the
ascertainable facts by preposterous
misrepresentations and falsehoods.
He is really speaking to the Commu-
nist world and such wavering
nations as are on the border be-
tween.
This presumably is what has
happened at Panmunjom in the
discussions about the Pueblo and its
crew. It will become clear soon that
the North Koreans regard the
Pueblo and its crew as incidental to
the larger objective of bringing a
great country face to face on equal
terms with a very small one.
â˜…
To illustrate this point I have
sought the recollections of a former
Navy officer who served for six long
months, first with Adm. C. Turner
Joy and later with Gen. William K.
Harrison Jr. at Panmunjom 15 years
ago. He is my son, Raymond Moley
Jr., at that time a lieutenant in Navy
intelligence and now retired.
During that period of negotiations
the fighting was still going on, so
near Panmunjom that the debate
was punctuated by gunfire which
shook the very tent in which the
negotiators sat. In these six months
12,000 American lives were sacri-
ficed, about half of the death losses
in the whole year.
Each day American representa-
tives would come with position
statements backed by fact. And the
Communists would respond by read-
ing papers prepared in Pyongyang
and Peking. Those counterar-
guments would be embellished with
glaring misstatements of fact,
trimmed with plenty of Marxist
doctrine and denunciations of "capi-
talist imperialism." This stuff was
not intended to convince the U.S.
and U.N. delegates but to be
disseminated throughout the world
behind the Iron Curtain.
The frustration of the allied
delegates as well as the generals in
the field-successively Douglas Mac-
Arthur, Matthew Ridgway and
Mark Clark-was compounded by
having their positions undermined
by directives from the State Depart-
ment, often by bureaucrats at the
Far Eastern desk.
The fervent expectation of Ameri-
cans that peace will come in
Vietnam when Hanoi comes to the
"negotiating table" should be tem-
pered by a realization of how the
Communist enemy will turn such
negotiations to its advantage. The
war will go on, perhaps with some
respite in the field. But from the
conference table there will be the
interminable propaganda to consoli-
date opinion in Communist coun-
tries, to win over the uncommitted
nations and to sow dissent in the
United States.
The Communist believes that the
future belongs to him. When armed
aggression fails, negotiation will
suffice. For the objective of commu-
nism is to isolate the United States
not only from the Communist world,
but from our undependable former
allies in Europe and the uncommit-
ted everywhere.
