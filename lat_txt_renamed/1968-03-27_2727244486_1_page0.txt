Nelson Rockefeller's press confer-
ence on March 21 may, as time rolls
on, be appraised not only as his
finest hour but as a moment of
awakening among all thoughtful
Republicans. It should in retrospect
rise above all the cynicism of
pundits and politicians, although as
the questions asked him by the
reporters show it was not above
their reach.
Aside from the incontrovertible
logic of his position, a human
element thrust itself through the
words of Rockefeller's statement—
words which may have been written
in collaboration with his literary
advisers.
There was logic and also the voice
of his own conviction when he said
in answer to a question about a
"moderate-conservative" split in the
GOP:
"Well I don't think that there is as
great a conservative-moderate split
as there was before in the party. I
think that this is a very fortunate
thing and my feeling has been that
if we start from the position of
getting the facts and then move to
alternative solutions and problems
at home and abroad and then
narrow those down, we should be
able to get a consensus."
I would agree with everything in
that statement, except the inference
that in 1964 there was really such a
split. At that time a suicidal brawl
preceded and followed the conven-
tion in San Francisco. During that
bitter and unhappy time partisans
of Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater
enlarged upon points of difference
which might have been resolved had
there been time and deliberation
enough to examine the facts.
The use of the word "moderate"
has been unfortunate and in reality
insubstantial. It was born in a short
period when another word, "extre-
mism," had a great play in the press
and in political discourse. There
were, of course, people and collec-
tions of people who overstepped the
bounds of truth, logic and good
sense, such as the Birchites. But all
of the leading Republican figures at
that time—former President Eisen-
hower, Richard Nixon, Goldwater
and Rockefeller—had repudiated
such views. Nixon, Rockefeller and
Gen. Eisenhower directly de-
nounced the Birch Society and its
views. Goldwater disagreed with the
views of the society but said that
many good people had joined it with-
out understanding its implications.
For that reason he was, during the
primary season and the convention,
tagged with the label "extremist" by
many Republicans.
The opposition thus generated
within the GOP set the pattern for
President Johnson and his people
until the election. In that campaign
the voice of logic was drowned out
in emotional frenzy. There could be
no real matching of the issues in
such an uproar. The Republican
Party as an effective alternative was
hopelessly shattered.
Then and since then there have
been no "liberal" Republicans. The
soft word "moderate" came into
currency. Where and when the term
"moderate" originated cannot be
exactly fixed, but I suspect it was in
New York. It was used there
because the term "liberal" had been
appropriated by a real political
party which was created as a means
of blackmailing the Democrats. Can-
didates who were endorsed by that
party billed themselves as Liberal
Democratic. And to create a distinc-
tion, Republicans called themselves
moderate.
Meanwhile, this illusion of ideolo-
gical differences among Republicans
obscured the real conflict, which
was a regional and personal power
struggle.
Time was when there were real
conflicts on issues within both the
Republican and Democratic parties.
The protective tariff was an item of
sectional differences among Repub-
licans in the days of Cleveland and
McKinley. The great international
interests centered in New York and
Boston were opposed to those of the
manufacturing and agricultural in-
terests of the Midwest and West.
But that issue is no longer major.
And now, in the cold war, the issue
of American international military
and economic responsibilities has
come to the fore. The 1968 Republi-
cans might well heed the history of
their own party, which in the days
of Seward and Blaine and T.R.
recognized our national responsibili-
ty in the oceans to the east and west.
Here there is room for accommo-
dation in 1968 between Nixon and
Rockefeller and others. And since
the Democrats are torn apart in a
struggle between the isolationism of
Sens. J. William Fulbright, Robert
Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy and
the international policies of Mr.
Johnson, the time is ripe for united
policies among all elements of the
Republican Party. There, at least, is
the chance for offering a sound
alternative.
