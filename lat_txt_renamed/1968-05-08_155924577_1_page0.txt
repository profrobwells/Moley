This 'Participatory Democracy'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
COLUMBIA, S.C.—The humilia-
tion of Columbia University by
hoodlums—some of whom were
students and some, like Stokely
Carmichael and H. Rap Brown,
lawless revolutionists—is a very
good example of a concept called
"participatory democracy." That is a
slogan apparently coined by the
New Left. It involves a concept
which is explicit in some and
implicit in all of Sen. Robert
Kennedy's more serious—I cannot
say more thoughtful—speeches.
That fancy phrase was the key to
the Students for a Democratic
Society's Port Huron manifesto in
1962. As is characteristic of the
statements of so many half-baked
intellectuals, that manifesto was full
of 10-dollar words and phrases. The
objective is "decentralization" or
"decision making of basic social
consequence carried on by public
groupings"—those groups being
concerned with education, housing,
job production and even "police
brutality."
The point is to demand real power
by private groups instead of by
legally constituted public servants.
Under this plan of setting up a
new decentralized civilization are a
number of SDS specifics:
"Local, regional and national eco-
nomic planning"; "a welfare state—
everyone's welfare according to
need"; public corporations to sup-
plant private businesses; interna-
tional systems of education; "uni-
versal controlled disarmament" un-
der the United Nations, "and the
gradual transfer of sovereignties...
to such machinery."
We have seen some of this in our
great cities. There the people in the
local communities have demanded
that federal funds for welfare be
administered by the beneficiaries,
selection of teachers and principals,
and the making of curricula by
parents, civilian boards to control
the police, and in colleges and
universities demands of students to
take over decision making from
trustees and administrators.
Ideas of the New Left get into
Kennedy speeches, according to
commentators Rowland Evans and
Robert Novak, through Jack New-
field, a leading spirit in the New
Left.
In Los Angeles Kennedy told
Negroes, "I want the control over
your destinies to be decided by the
people in Watts, not by those of us
who are in Washington."
So this is "participatory democra-
cy." And we have seen it in action at
Columbia University. Three or four
hundred students, black and white,
entered and occupied five vital
buildings where undergraduate and
graduate classes meet and where
administrative and faculty offices
are located. A squad also occupied
and held the president's office
where once the great Nicholas
Murray Butler and former President
Dwight Eisenhower held sway. Thus
these storm troopers seized the vital
spots where the university's gov-
ernment operates much as revolu-
tions in Europe have successfully
overthrown governments.
And the negotiations which fol-
lowed were marked by the endless
delaying procedure which are mark-
ing the effort of the United States to
talk terms with Hanoi. For a long
time mediation by faculty com-
mittees failed because of the de-
mands of the rebels.
The news of these events which
reached me here, hundreds of miles
from Morningside Heights, was food
for some sad reflections. I held the
title of professor of public law there
for 25 years. The very department of
which I was a member was founded
by a great student of the Constitu-
tion, John W. Burgess. He taught
that our constitutional system was
at once a pattern of law and a
guarantee of liberty, and that there
could be no liberty without law. But
"participatory democracy" rejects
law and destroys liberty. And it isn't
even democracy when a few
hundred students deny the right of
thousands who are trying to get an
education.
By coincidence there was pub-
lished in the local newspaper which
told of the disgraceful events at
Columbia University a tribute to the
great German-born liberal Francis
Lieber who taught at South Carolina
College before the Civil War. He
went from there to Columbia Col-
lege in New York and is honored
there by a professorship named for
him. As a graduate student I studied
political philosophy with the Lieber
Professor at Columbia. In his writ-
ings there is a reminder to all of the
danger in the doctrines of such
demagogs as Robert Kennedy:
"The true republican wants no
absolutism of any sort—none to
practice on others, and none to
practice on himself."
