PHOENIXâ€”"Reappraisal" is a
word which has gained great favor
in current discourse. Presidential
candidates have been reappraising
their decisions whether to run ever
since January. Congress and the
President are reappraising their
fiscal policies. And businesses are
reappraising their plans according
to government policies and political
prospects.
Along with that trend, Arizona
and California have measurably
reappraised their long-disputed
claims to the water of the Colorado
River. The result is a plan known as
the Central Arizona Project. Various
versions of that project have been
before Congress from time to time
since the Truman Administration.
The Colorado is a hefty river but
the needs of the states through
which it and its tributaries flow are
prodigious. Back in the 1920s an
allocation of the water was made
between what is called the upper
basin and the lower basin. The
lower basin states are Arizona,
California, Nevada and New Mexico.

Under that interstate compact
Arizona was to have the use of 2.8
million acre-feet of the water, Cali-
fornia 4.4 million acre-feet and Neva-
da 300,000. But when the Hoover
Dam was built, the then secretary of
the interior made contracts with
water users in California for 5,362,-
000 acre-feet and that state built
channels to carry the water from
Lake Mead.
Arizona's problem was made very
difficult because the river was 200 to
250 miles distant from the three
counties that needed the water.
Those were Maricopa (Phoenix),
Pima (Tucson) and Pinal. The
problem was to pump the water
from the river, lift it 900 feet over a
mountain hump and to channel it to
the parched counties.
The cost of the whole project
including the channels, and so forth,
was estimated at $2.2 billion. That
plan was approved by the Senate in
1950 and 1951. But the House failed
to act because there was strong
opposition from California and
states in the East which objected to
the great cost of supplying the needs
of so small a state.
Since California insisted upon the
more than 5 million acre-feet which
had been assigned to it through
earlier contracts, Arizona brought
suit in the Supreme Court in 1952 to
validate its claim for the 2.8 million
acre-feet. After 11 years the court
decided in Arizona's favor.
But there still remained the
problem of getting the means for
transporting the water. For a while
Arizona was busy designing a plan
to carry the burden itself. Its plan
was to build two lower dams above
the Hoover Dam on the river and
with the power thus generated carry
the water to the needy counties. It
was to be financed with the state's
revenue bonds.
*
But Sen. Carl Hayden and the
Arizona House members decided to
attempt to have Congress authorize
a plan at federal expense. After
many compromises the present plan
was devised. California was quieted
by provisions that it should have
prior claim to 4.4 million acre-feet
and also that there would be
facilities to augment the flow of the
river by desalinization.
In this reappraisal two hard facts
are recognized. One is that the idea
so fanatically promoted by Pres-
ident Roosevelt and Secretary Ickes
in the 1930s that electric power
generated by hydroelectric dams is
cheaper than generation by coal and
steam is a myth. And the certain
advent of nuclear energy may well
make the great power dams in not so
many years monuments to political
folly.

Another fact recognized in this
plan is that as cities and industries
grow in such arid areas as Central
Arizona, they must have priority
over irrigation in the use of water.
Back there in the controversies of
the early 1950s it was shown that if
the agricultural acreage were cut by
10% there would be water for a city
twice the size of Phoenix. That
growth has already been exceeded
and the city has actually taken over
much of the crop-raising land. And
the water problem here is much less
serious than it was 20 years ago.
That is a lesson which was recog-
nized in the laws of Hammurabi
4,000 years ago. The priorities were
people first, then animals and,
finally, the land.
