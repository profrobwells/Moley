And If the Democrats Deadlock?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The heated contest for the Demo-
cratic presidential nomination is
providing such a volume of newspa-
per copy that one possible outcome
seems to be given little or no
attention. That is the quite possible
deadlock which may happen when
the Democrats meet in Chicago in
August.
At the moment it seems probable
that Sen. Robert Kennedy, with his
primary victories, his great financial
resources and his organization's
effort in primary states, will enter
the convention with considerable
strength.
His major rival, Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, has formidable
assets. Organized labor, always loyal
to him and to the President, is
mounting a powerful campaign, well
financed and with great power in
industrial states. This can be count-
ed upon as a major factor in win-
ning delegate strength.
Although the President will pro-
bably make no declaration favoring
his Vice President, the Democratic
organizations will quite naturally
regard Humphrey as his preferred
heir. For that reason state Democra-
tic organizations which have been
well supplied with patronage and
favors in the Johnson years will no
doubt pledge hundreds of delegates
to Humphrey.
*
At the moment, I believe that
the Humphrey quest will succeed.
But suppose his aggregate of dele-
gates falls short of a majority?
For Sen. Eugene McCarthy, if he
stays in contention, will have a
smaller but an effective minority of
delegate votes. And with his appeal
to youth and to more sober people
who fear Kennedy and his stand on
Vietnam, he might have enough to
deny either of his rivals a nomina-
tion on the first ballot or even on a
second ballot.
And there also may be a few
favorite son delegates, at least on
the first ballot.
Let us then speculate upon what
might happen. Deep in the minds of
every case-hardened politician is the
desire to win. And in that instance it
would be quite natural for a great
many delegates to believe that
with the threat of a Republican
resurgence, under the probably
already nominated Richard Nixon,
and the stark reality that this is the
year for the "outs," they would feel
safer with Mr. Johnson than with
Humphrey as a candidate.
Politicians seldom pay much at-
tention to personal wishes of a
candidate they prefer. And they
would take Lyndon Johnson's an-
nounced retirement with reserva-
tions. At that moment, perhaps after
the first and certainly after the
second ballot, a great hue and cry
would arise for Mr. Johnson as the
nominee.
What then?
*
In my visit to Texas earlier this
month, I heard from informed
sources that the President meant
just what he said.
On one thing President Johnson
probably has no reservations. He
does not want Kennedy as a
successor.
And if in his shrewd, calculating
mind he has decided at convention
time that Humphrey cannot win the
election or even the nomination, he
will look for an alternative.
At that moment, according to
informed calculations, the President
would not only reject the nomina-
tion for himself but suggest, in ways
he knows so well, to his friends
among the delegates, the name of a
Democratic dark horse. I learned
nothing of the name of such a
possible alternative to Humphrey.
But with Johnson's support and
Kennedy failing to create a stam-
pede for himself, any one of several
Democratic notables would fit the
need in mind.
This I offer as a piece of highly
informed speculation. Take it or
leave it.
