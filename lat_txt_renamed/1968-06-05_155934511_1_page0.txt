Goldwater's Libel Suit
Could Improve Government
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In summing up for the defense in
Barry Goldwater's libel suit against
the now defunct Fact magazine, its
publisher and managing editor, the
lawyer said that the plaintiff's
motive was to help his campaign for
senator in Arizona.
That charge was absurd. For
during a recent visit in Phoenix I
was told by Goldwater's friends and
associates that this lawsuit will
either have no effect politically at
all or will measurably hurt the
former senator.
His objective lies beyond the
jury's verdict in his favor. It is to
establish, in a clear-cut case in the
U.S. Supreme Court, the limits to
which a public official or a candi-
date can be subject to irresponsible,
defamatory attacks.
If limits to criticism can legally be
established, many more good men
and women will be induced to seek
or hold public office. For certain
recent decisions of the Supreme
Court have cast a murk of doubt
over the question whether there are
any limits beyond which public
figures are safe from scurrilous
abuse.
Here it is necessary to consider
some of the facts of the case.
Goldwater's suit was brought in a
New York federal court against
Fact, its former publisher, Ralph
Ginzburg, and its managing editor,
Warren Boroson.
In October, 1964, the whole issue
of Fact was devoted to the attack in
question. The headline was: "1,189
Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psy-
chologically Unfit to Be President."
The magazine had sent a question-
naire to 12,356 psychiatrists listed as
such by the American Medical Assn.
There were 2,417 replies. Of these,
657 said Goldwater was fit, 571
declined to take a position and 1,189
claimed him unfit. Among the
comments of the latter group were
such epithets as: "immature,"
"grossly psychotic," "paranoid,"
"mass murderer," "amoral and im-
moral," "chronic schizophrenic" and
"dangerous lunatic."

The nonprofessional nature of the
attacks were immediately con-
demned by the AMA and the
American Psychiatric Assn. But, of
course, this professional repudiation
came after the damage was done.
The publisher in question, Ginz-
burg, who had no professional
competence at all, contributed an
editorial full of the juicy Freudian
jargon embedded in the replies.
It is important to note the
foregoing figures. For 80% of those
interrogated did not answer, no
doubt because professional ethics
forbids a diagnosis or prognosis
when the doctor has had no contact
with the "patient." Goldwater said
under oath: "I have never talked
with a psychiatrist in my life."
A very grave question was raised
when 1,846 (the 1,189 who said
Goldwater was unfit and the 657
who said he was fit) gave an opinion
when they had never examined the
subject.
The entire attack was an excellent
example of the extent to which
Freudianism has penetrated some
aspects of psychiatric diagnosis.
Psychiatry itself was, before the
impact of Freud, what I have called
"an art trying to be a science."
Freud has plunged a terribly dange-
rous element into the situation.
Freudianism has already pene-
trated education and the social
sciences and the Fact publication
threw this mishmash into politics.
For Freud in his writings exercised
great poetic license. Almost any
paragraph is contradicted by anoth-
er paragraph. Anyone attacked with
this weapon is almost helpless.
And the damage to rational living
is increased because any amateur
can use this gibberish to attack an
opponent.
Since the facts in the Goldwater
case are so clear-cut, it is difficult to
see how the court can fail to
dissipate the fog created by its
earlier decisions.
The first of those cases, decided in
1964, concerned an advertisement in
the New York Times attacking a
city commissioner in Montgomery,
Ala. The court by a majority of six
rendered a decision, the key point of
which was that the plaintiff in such
an action must prove that the
defamatory statement "was made
with 'actual malice'â€”that is, with
the knowledge that it was false or
with reckless disregard of whether
it was false or not."
But as Justice Hugo Black said in
a concurring opinion, malice "is an
elusive, abstract concept, hard to
prove and hard to disprove. The
requirement that malice be proved
provides at best an evanescent
protection for the right critically to
discuss public affairs and certainly
does not measure up to the sturdy
safeguard embodied in the First
Amendment."
Thus, the concern of the court, and
especially of Justices Black and
William O. Douglas, was with the
publisher of defamatory statements
rather than with the victim of such
attacks. Moreover, the Times case
clearly placed the status of a public
official on a quite different ground
from that of a private citizen
seeking protection from defamatory
attack.
Two other cases involving public
officials in West Virginia and Loui-
siana, rendered in 1967 and 1968,
followed the ruling in the Times
case.
However, in the case of the well-
known libel suit of Wally Butts,
athletic director of the University of
Georgia, against the Saturday Even-
ing Post, the Supreme Court in 1967
sustained the lower courts' decisions
favoring Butts. And Chief Justice
Earl Warren in a concurring opinion
said: "I am satisfied that the
evidence here discloses that degree
of reckless disregard of the truth of
which we spoke in the New York
Times. Freedom of the press
does not include license to destroy
lives or careers."
It is pertinent to note what Justice
Abe Fortas said in dissenting with
the court in the Louisiana case:
"The First Amendment is not so
fragile that it requires us to immu-
nize this kind of reckless, destruc-
tive invasion of the life, even of
public officials, heedless of their
interests and sensitivities. The First
Amendment is not a shelter for the
character assassinator, whether his
action is heedless and reckless or
deliberate.
*
"The occupation of public office-
holder does not forfeit one's mem-
bership in the human race. The
public official should be subject to
severe scrutiny and to free and open
criticism. But if he is needlessly,
heedlessly, falsely accused of crime,
he should have a remedy in law. The
New York Times case does not
preclude this minimal standard of
civilized living."
It was not an easy decision that
Goldwater made in bringing his suit.
For it exposed him and his wife to a
three-week ordeal in which the
defense stripped to the bone every
element of his public and private
life.
Unless the court soon clarifies the
protection of public men and wo-
men, our country will be governed
by only the callous and thick-
skinned, and political life will sink
into a swamp of scurrilous gossip,
lies and, in the case of Fact, Freu-
dian diagnosis.
