Must We Have Primaries
to Prove Pollsters Wrong?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The tumult and the shouting in
and about the presidential primaries
are now still for another four years.
Have they left us better able to
choose a President in November, or
later if neither major candidate gets
a majority of electoral votes? Are we
more enlightened about the issues
and the personalities? what price
has been paid for these revels now
concluded?
There are mixed answers to these
questions. In their favor there is one
outstanding value. They have
measurably lessened the danger of
what might have been tyranny of
the polls and the pollsters.
The publicly published polls'have
been with us more than 40 years.
They have become sort of a fifth
estate in our system of government.
They have been celebrated among
us much as were the blurry incanta-
tions of the oracle of Delphi among
the Greeks. They are breathlessly
awaited and analyzed by the public,
the politicians and the candidates.
In our economy, poll-taking has
become a considerable industry.
â˜…
I am referring here only to polls
that are taken statewide or on a
national basis and published for
public consumption. Beyond that,
poll-taking has a certain limited
usefulness. Parties and candidates
have private polls, mostly to guide
the process of campaigning. They
are useful in selecting issues to be
stressed and determining the locali-
ties and groups where money
and effort should be expended.
Businessmen use them in merchan-
dising their products.
But if there had been no primaries
this year, the polls would have been
the sole guide to the convention
delegates who are vested by law
with the responsibility of choosing
the major candidates.
Even now Gov. Nelson Rockefeller
is spending huge sums of his money
in an appeal from the primaries to
the polls. On the other hand,
Richard Nixon appealed from the
polls to the primaries.

The fallibility of polls has been so
widely revealed that it needs little
elaboration here.
Their reliability can be challenged
because pollsters cannot know the
truthfulness of those who are
questioned. The British parties have
long taken secret canvasses at the
beginning and end of campaigns,
and the party people there told me
that they estimate 25% of the peo-
ple questioned do not tell the truth.
The polls are based upon samples
of all voters, but no one can know
what proportion of the people wil
actually vote, and the nonvoters in a
general election include something
like 20% to 25% of the eligibles.
Also, a large proportion of the
people polled simply have no opi-
nion at the moment they are
questioned about how they will vote
in an election.
Primaries are governed by law,
and the results are hard and
considered preferences.
And the actual numbers in the
primaries this year have revealed
how wrong so many of the pollsters'
predictions have been.
Overall, the presidential primaries
over the years have not lived up to
expectations and promises made for
them in the progressive era in which
they were born.
No aspirant can carry on a cam-
paign in all of the states which
provide for a presidential choice.
The best a contestant can do is
select a few to show the breadth
and strength of his popularity.
Finally, the delegates that are
selected or directed by an expres-
sion of preferences in the primaries
are only a small fraction of the con-
ention strength necessary to nomi-
nate.
The suggestion made since the
conclusion of the primaries by
Barry Goldwater and Sen. Mike
Mansfield, that there be only one
nationwide primary, is preposte-
rous. It would multiply to an infinite
degree the defects already apparent
in the primary system.
This is a republic with representa-
tive institutions, and despite the
defects of the system of the prepri-
mary years it was preferable and
produced better Presidents than we
have had since presidential prima-
ries were introduced.
