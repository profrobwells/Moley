Political Parties Play Vital
Role in U.S. Government
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are many Americans who
seem to be appalled at the prospect
that the two major candidates for
President, Richard Nixon and
Hubert Humphrey, are loyal party
men. And that they will be nominat-
ed by delegates who themselves are
loyal party members.
Those who are unhappy about this
should be reminded that this meth-
od of choice is the normal operation
of our two-party system. It has been
validated by law and decreed by
custom over the generations. It is
based upon the principle of repre-
sentative government. It is as much
a part of our system of government
as is the making of laws by
representatives in our legislative
assemblies.
But ever since the Progressive Era
began early in this century, refor-
mers have been striving to break
down this system by injecting what
has been called "more democracy"
into the operation. And no little
harm has been done to party
responsibility by most of the innova-
tions which have been introduced.
Out of the direct primary emerged
the presidential preference prima-
ries in some states. And for many
reasons which need not be recited
here these preferential primaries
have not lived up to the claims of
their promoters. The evils of democ-
racy have not been cured, as one
reformer said back there, by "more
democracy."
The recent idea, proposed by such
widely different people as Sen. Mike
Mansfield and Barry Goldwater, of a
national primary in all the states is a
revival of the psychology of the
early Progressives. The argument
for it is this: since a partial
"democracy" has not worked well, a
lot of democracy would be better.
And Gov. Nelson Rockefeller has
brought the matter to the point of
absurdity by suggesting that there
be a national poll at this late date to
select the candidate of the Republi-
can Party. It should be noted that
this poll would include not only
registered Republicans but all vo-
ters of all parties. And the poll
would be conducted not by legally
constituted agencies of government
but by a combination of Louis
Harris and George Gallup and other
private, commercial organizations
and financed by private and semi-
public funds.
On the other side there is talk of
another splinter party, with Eugene
McCarthy or someone else as the
candidate, to appeal from the va-
rious primaries and conventions to
the electorate in the national elec-
tion.
And there is already in existence
the George Wallace movement
whose slogan is a "curse" on both
the major parties and whose pur-
pose is to commit the choice of a
President to the House of Represen-
tatives.
All of these proposals seem to be
rooted in a widespread public con-
tempt for parties and for the people
who operate the parties.
In a recent Harris Survey it was
shown that, of all professional
categories, politicians ranked
lowest. And that those who serve in
government at all levels rank next
lowest on the totem poll. "Leader-
ship" in medicine, science and
business led all the rest.
Perhaps it has always been that
way with public opinion. We see
monuments everywhere to honor
dead politicians. Abraham Lincoln,
Thomas Jefferson and Robert Taft
have their place in marble and stone
in Washington, along with revered
military figures.
Thus it is after those politicians
are dead. These people lived in
politics all their lives, but we render
them respect only when they are
cold in the dust. But when they
were alive they were the object of
contempt and distrust because they
were politicians.
But these men plying their de-
spised trade, along with many
others who are not thus commemor-
ated, created our political institu-
tions and shaped the laws and
customs under which we enjoy our
liberty and live our lives.
What is needed is a wider
understanding of the vital role of
politics and parties in our life.
Reformers cannot improve party
affairs by reducing the responsibili-
ty of parties by heavy infusions of
"more" democracy. Improvement
will come when more of our "best"
people take part in party affairs at
all levels. For the quality of parties
and the wisdom of their decisions
depend upon the people who are
active within them and who partici-
pate in their decisions.
