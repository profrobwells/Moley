Occasionally in the mounting pile
of newsprint about George Wallace
there is mention of similarity with
Huey Long, long since sanctified in
the byways and bayous of Louisi-
ana. It is true that there are
similarities. But the contrasts are
much more important.
On this subject I am inclined to
open my own book of memory. For I
enjoyed-yes, enjoyed an acquain-
tance with Long over a period
between 1932 and 1935. It was one of
the tasks assigned to me while I
served as an assistant to Franklin D.
Roosevelt to maintain contact with
several odd but important political
figures whom Roosevelt found it
difficult, if not unpleasant, to get on
with.
★
My purpose in maintaining a
contact with Long was not to do
anything with him or about him.
And for that reason our relations
were cordial and, to me, very
interesting. In our many talks I was
fascinated by the power and quick-
ness of his mind, his cosmic preten-
tions and the methods by which he
exercised his great but fleeting
power.
In such a relationship Long could
throw off the motley of a demagog
and talk quietly about public affairs,
his own career before his rise to
dictatorship and the reforms he had
initiated in his state.
His mind beneath the outward
show was powerful and resourceful.
It was an instrument the like of
which I had hardly known in all my
contacts with public figures. He
might have given great service to
his state and the nation had he
chosen to use that mind within the
limits of reason and common sense.
After his death I wrote this:
"He used his first-rate mind for his
own reckless, grandiose and shoddy
ends. He used it to destroy the
foundations upon which so many of
his worthy reforms rested. He
destroyed many things with that
mind. And among the victims of his
excesses was himself."
No one in his generation, even his
bitter enemies, could deny that
Long was an authentic reformer and
builder. As a public service commis-
sioner and as governor and senator
he reduced public utility rates,
abolished the poll tax, reformed the
schools and brought the care of the
crippled and insane up to date. He
built bridges and roads (which
seldom extended into areas which
were hostile to his machine.) He
built hospitals and reformed the
state medical school. He built a 34-
story state capitol building. And he
made Louisiana State University an
institution of high rank.
When Roosevelt and Henry Wal-
lace secured the adoption of the
farm plan of 1933, Long proposed an
alternative. And after the Supreme
Court struck down the AAA in 1936,
the plan adopted in its place was in
some way an adaptation of the Long
ideas.
Wallace has no such mind, and
despite his dominant position in
Alabama's politics he has created no
such reforms. His appeal to the
unhappy voters in 1968 is purely
negative. His harangues are no
better than those uttered for a long
time by many demagogs over the
nation. His is the routine answer to
centralized government and the
liberal establishment. It may well be
that after this election Wallace will
fade into the obscurity in which
reside other famous demagogs of the
past-Tillman, Blease and Heflin.
Moreover, the unspoken appeal of
Wallace is mostly racial. In Long's
time there might have been racial
problems but they were not a
political issue.
★
In a very important respect
Wallace differs greatly from Long.
The man from Alabama has never
failed to get what he could from the
Washington government which he
now denounces. But Long reached
into the resources of his state for the
money necessary to improve his
state. In this he was a real exponent
of state responsibility.
Long, like Wallace, threw a great
scare into the Democratic Party by
threatening to run as an indepen-
dent in 1936. Farley's staff reported
to Roosevelt in early 1935 that if
Long decided to run he would get
10% of the national vote. That
stimulated the President to launch
his own "soak-the-rich" tax pro-
gram. But after the assassination of
Long later that year, Roosevelt went
on to a landslide re-election and
Long slipped into the history books.
