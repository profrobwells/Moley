Different Kind of President
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No doubt in the histories to be
written in the years ahead there will
be innumerable interpretations of
the character of Richard Nixon. In
that respect he may share the fate of
Woodrow Wilson—the jury in that
case is still unable to reach a verdict.
Indeed, a perceptive and sympa-
thetic writer, Vermont Royster of
the Wall Street Journal, already has
perceived a likeness to the World
War I president. Both men, he says,
might be called "intellectual intro-
verts."
Another sympathetic analysis ap-
peared in Earl Mazo's book, "Rich-
ard Nixon: A Personal and Political
Portrait," in 1959. (This excellent
book, revised, has been republished
this year with Stephen Hess as the
co-author.) Mazo discovered in his
subject a strong element of fatalism.
And in noting this in 1959, and also
earlier this year, I suggested this
from Shakespeare:
"If it be not now, yet it will come:
the readiness is all."
★
After something more than a
casual acquaintance with Nixon
over the 20 years since the Alger
Hiss case, I believe that both of
these appraisals fail in exactness.
Royster's comparison with Woodrow
Wilson misses because Wilson never
to the end doubted his rightness or,
may I say, his own rectitude. Nixon
consistently has turned his unques-
tionably fine mind not only to re-
peated appraisals of policies but has
relentlessly studied his own nature:
"What did I do that I should not
have done?" "What did I leave un-
done that I should have done?"
Mazo's suggestion of fatalism is
good so far as it goes. But in Nixon's
case it never has been the fatalism of
Oriental philosophers. For that is a
passive acceptance of what comes.
Nixon, with Spartan determination,
has been preparing himself for the
presidency ever since in 1952 Gen.
Eisenhower chose him as a junior
partner. "Readiness" for the trial,
the burden and, if possible, the tri-
umph in the position he has now at-
tained has been an abiding concern.
Never since Jefferson has a Pres-
ident had such a self-imposed educa-
tion. By making the hitherto mea-
ningless office of Vice President a
vital factor in great affairs, he has
seen the conditions and the conse-
quences of presidential decisions.
He had, in truth, a piece of the
action. And since he believed him-
self to be in the line of succession, he
was ready in 1960. In the years since
he has continued that preparation
with study and travel here and
abroad. His "readiness" is our
assurance.
Those who fall back on the
familiar excuse for lack of under-
standing and call Nixon complex
will lose the clue. To those who
know him best and have been
closest to him, he is not complex. In
many of his decisions he has
rejected their advice. When Pres-
ident Johnson ordered a bombing
limitation on the eve of the election,
some of his advisers wanted him to
denounce the act as a political
gambit. He would not agree because
he believed that Mr. Johnson had
acted in the national interest. In
1960 he refused to follow those who
would have contested the patent
fraud in three states. He did not
agree to that contest because he held
inviolate the national interest
against the chaos that would cer-
tainly have followed such a contest.
This I know to be true.
Years ago he realized that it was
not in his nature to be an extrovert
like the two Roosevelts. He gave
respect priority over popularity. He
told me in 1960 that he detested the
image-making that was so popular
at that time. He said any such effort
would be patently contrived.
The authentic Nixon was revealed
on the Meet the Press show on the
Sunday before the election. He was
thoughtful, deadly serious—no fine
phrases or wisecracks. That is the
Nixon in whose hands so much of
our destiny lies for years to come.
And considering the trials and
vicissitudes that lie ahead, that
character is what fits the mood of
the times.
