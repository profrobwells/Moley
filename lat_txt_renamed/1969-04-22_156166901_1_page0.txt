Too Much Conservation?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Walter J. Hickel, shortly
after being designated as interior
secretary, made some statements in
an interview to the effect that the
conservation of our national re-
sources had been overemphasized,
he found himself the target of bitter
attack.
For the conservation of natural
resources has come to be a sacred
cow in our nation's affairs. It is
supported by many powerful inter-
ests: the federal bureaucracy whose
job is dependent upon government
ownership, politicians from several
states whose constituents depend
upon government benefits and ma-
ny groups and associations of zealous
people to whom recreation is not
only a way of life but who believe
that the pursuit of leisure should be
the nation's major goal. Indeed, if
some conservationists had their way
we all would be moving back toward
the nation portrayed by James
Fenimore Cooper—a wilderness
populated only by animals hunted
by Indians and by white men
hunting Indians.
Secretary Hickel's "sin" was com-
pounded by the fact that he was a
successful businessman. For any
enterprising individual who propo-
ses to develop any part of the public
domain is regarded as a villainous
exploiter and profit monger.

But Hickel survived the initial
attack and after a considerable
ordeal was confirmed by the Senate,
no doubt with the votes of several
Democrats who were willing to have
in the Nixon Administration a
choice target for partisan attack
later.
But a considerable number of
informed people believed that Secre-
tary Hickel's comment about conser-
vation made a good deal of sense.
For ever since Theodore Roosevelt
made conservation a major national
issue the trend in Congress has been
to lock up a great deal of our
national wealth in a sterile and
unprofitable sanctuary.
It is difficult to fix the exact
proportion of the landed area of this
country which is owned by the
federal government but one official
figure puts it at one-third. In several
states the federal government owns
more than 80% of the land and in
Alaska the percentage is about 95
None will deny that this public
domain should be jealously guarded
against destructive exploitation. But
in many areas private investment
and operation would not only yield
profits for a needy Treasury but
would preserve natural values bet-
ter than under government manage-
ment. Many of the privately owned
forest properties are better managed
and renewed than are the national
forests.
The really important issue is
whether under government owner-
ship and management these great
properties are self-supporting.
In July, 1968, Interior Secretary
Udall issued what he called a
"Report to Our Stockholders, the
American People—How Their Con-
servation Dollars Are Invested."
The cost of the department to the
taxpayers (out of congressional ap-
propriations) in fiscal 1968 was
$1.804 billion. Receipts from various
sources, user charges, leases, royal-
ties and sales amounted to $1.959
billion. Thus the Treasury had a
profit of $155 million.
But this "profit" would have been
a big deficit except for one item,
"Bonus bids for oil leases, $1.260
billion." This item in 1968 was
accounted for by the granting of
leases a year ago for drilling by the
oil companies in the outer continen-
tal shelf. The companies paid $600
million for such leases in the Santa
Barbara channel. But because of the
trouble there in January and Feb-
ruary this year and the subsequent
restriction of drilling by the Interior
Department this item of profit is
now in grave doubt.
It may be said with little legiti-
mate contradiction that the great
wealth held in custody by the
federal government over the years
has not only yielded no real profit to
the Treasury but has been a very
considerable expense.
Thus Uncle Sam is like some
farmers we have heard of as "land-
poor." Lots of land and no profit.
One of the arguments for this vast
monopoly is that we are saving this
wealth for future generations. But
we are also consigning to those
generations a debt which is rapidly
approaching $400 billion. Unless this
new Administration provides better
management for our natural re-
sources this nation may be made
bankrupt by its own wealth.
