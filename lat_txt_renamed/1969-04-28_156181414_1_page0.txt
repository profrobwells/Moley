It's a pity that the introduction of
black studies in so many institutions
should come at a moment when
militancy among both white and
black students is rampant and when
those dissidents have so many and
such diverse objectives. For long
ago there should have been a place
in the curriculum for courses in
Negro history and culture.
The purpose of such studies
should have been twofold: first, to
put the subject into the context of
American history and culture; more
significantly, to provide for Negroes
that pride in their race and its
contributions so essential to their
self-respect. Like every ethnic group
in our society, this one seeks
identification with and understand-
ing of its past.
There is no problem about materi-
als for a course or two because there
is a considerable and growing body
of literature available to every
college and university.
Moreover, there is nothing incom-
patible in seeking at the same time
two objectives: first, to provide for
the assimilation of the Negro in our
common life; second, to encourage
him to learn more about his own
heritage. America is a melting pot
and in the Americanization move-
ment of a generation ago there was
such a twofold purpose in education-
al work among European immi-
grants.
But in our history books and in the
content of our teaching in the past
there was plenty of attention to
slavery and the tragic struggle
among the states before it was
abolished. But only scant attention
was given to the slaves themselves
and the part they have played since
their emancipation. This, as we see
now, was a grave omission.
But there are serious practical
problems in launching such courses
now in the context of the many
troubles that beset our educational
system. These problems are de-
scribed in a letter. I have received
from a professorial friend in one of
our large universities who himself
attempted to work with his students
in giving a course in black history
and culture. He says in part:
"No, I shall certainly not partici-
pate further in the black studies
field simply because it has become
too militant and too political. Most
militant young blacks today will not
accept anything on the subject from
a white person on the grounds that
it is not valid. The question of race
relations in the United States is a
painful one. On the other hand, it is
humiliating and demeaning to fine
black scholars to be told that they
are wanted to teach black history
rather than to utilize their talents in
all the fields of interest in which any
normally good scholar may wish to
operate.
"Some of these courses could be of
special value to idealistic young
blacks and to white students as
well."
But, he continues, "These young
people are as badly in need of a
general education covering the
whole range of human culture as are
many other students. The setting up
of large black studies programs,
including many courses, perhaps a
separate department or college, can
have two unfortunate consequences
at the present time.
"First, if students take large
numbers of specialized courses, they
will not acquire the general educa-
tion they so greatly need. Second, as
you have suggested, I doubt if there
is enough material to justify thor-
ough and sound treatment beyond a
very few courses. No student, black
or white, is going to finish with
what appears to be a second-class
program or a second-class degree.
"Finally, there are not enough
first-rate black scholars to man
many such courses, and it would be
a disaster for the prestigious univer-
sities suddenly to pull these few
qualified teachers away from posi-
tions in less attractive institutions."
The fact is that the whole move-
ment has become so entangled with
militancy that there is grave danger
that such courses, so hastily con-
trived and taught, will be nothing
but means of propaganda, political
action and methods of revolutionary
coercion generally. There can be
little free inquiry in such an
atmosphere as prevails on many
campuses at the present time.
In short, the enemies of black
studies are not the college authori-
ties, who hasten to find peace in
compliance, but the very people who
are so vociferous in demanding such
instruction.
