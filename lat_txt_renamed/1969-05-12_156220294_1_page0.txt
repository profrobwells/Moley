U.S. Finance: The Bigger the
Surplus, the Bigger the Debt
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Americans who read only the
headlines complacently believe that
President Nixon's revision of the
Johnson budget figures gives the
government a nice surplus of re-
ceipts over expenditures for fiscal
1970. And thus that the threat of
inflation may well be measurably
arrested.
But experienced budget-watchers
have no such illusion. They see that
except for a trick in budget making
introduced by Lyndon Johnson a
year or so ago the Nixon figures
would really end in red figures
rather than in black.
Wilbur Mills, House Ways and
Means chairman, the wisest fiscal
expert in Washington, quite correct-
ly points out that if there is to be
any meaningful cut in spending in
fiscal 1970, the cut below the
Johnson budget should be $10
billion rather than Mr. Nixon's
figure of $5.5 billion. Indeed, a high
official in the Nixon Administration
has admitted that the Nixon figures
under traditional budget making
really promise a deficit.
The key to the mystery lies in
budget making. The old way of
determining deficits and surpluses
used the figures of what has been
called the Administrative Budget.
This included receipts from indivi-
dual and corporate income taxes and
other revenues to be used for
general purposes. The so-called
"trust fund" figures were kept in a
separate category. For these re-
ceipts were tagged for specific
purposes (mostly to pay for Social
Security and highways). The taxes
were the Social Security tax and the
tax on oil and gasoline.
Since the money necessary for the
trust funds had to be sufficiently in
hand for future outlays, the trust
fund figures always showed a com-
fortable surplus.
The Johnson trick was to count
overall receipts, including both the
Administrative budget and trust
fund incomes. This change in budg-
et making was explained in the
government's analysis of the 1968
budget.
At this point some simple-minded
taxpayer might ask this pertinent
question:
"Why, if the President's figures
show a surplus of receipts over
expenditures, was it necessary for
him to ask for and get from
Congress a rise in the debt limit
from $365 to $377 billion?"
The answer is that when excess
money is received from trust fund
taxes and is to be kept in the trust
funds, it is invested in government
securities. For the so-called trust
funds are really a collection of
government IOUs. These securities
are bought mostly by the banks who
take them to the Federal Reserve
and who are paid in new money
created for the purpose. It is this
new money which in large part fuels
the fires of inflation. For as the
volume of circulation currency rises,
so do prices and presumably wages,
too.
Another pertinent question ap-
pears at this point. Why instead of
printing new government IOUs and
new money and thus inflating the
volume of money does not the
government go into the open market
and buy the securities it needs for
the trust funds?
For-so far as the securities already
issued and in the hands of investors
are concerned, the inflationary da-
mage has already been done. The
Treasury could buy them for its
trust funds without printing new
securities, which in t' causes the
Federal Reserve to print new mo-
ney.
And now a fantastically simple
conclusion must be "eached. The
more surplus the government is able
to show under the new overall
budget plan, the greater the rise in
the national debt. This, indeed,
defies the reason of ordinary people.
But the makers of budgets and the
keepers of the government books
are not ordinary people. They are
politicians whose livelihood and
continuance in office depend almost
entirely upon their capacity to
hoodwink the people who are pay-
ing the taxes.
And while we are on this subject
of inflation, another observation is
in order. In last year's campaign,
candidates for Congress said a great
deal about the evils of inflation. The
supermarkets rang with appeals to
the housewives whose budgets were
pinched by high prices.
Once elected, these members of
Congress forgot about the house-
wives but they did remember what
they said about inflation, and they
did something about it.
They raised their own pay and
that of high officers in the executive
branch. Whatever might happen,
these chosen people must be protect-
ed for years to come.
Now, however, they are hearing
from the taxpayers and what they
hear is not pleasant.
