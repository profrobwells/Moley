Failure of the Faculties
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the past two years I have, in
composing these weekly pieces,
hesitated to add to the torrent of
comment about the campus ordeals.
One reason for this restraint has
been my isolation in the high tower
of journalism where one sees so
many and knows so few. I simply do
not know enough students to understand
what has gotten into them.
It has been 17 years since I
terminated my professorship at
Columbia University after having
dropped the single course which I
had offered for some years before
retirement. Since then, except for
visits to a few universities and
rather casual attendance at meetings
of boards of trustees of which I
have been a member, my relations
with the academic community have
been minimal.
*
But what I read in the press of the
reactions of administrators, trustees
and faculties to student unrest encourages
me to believe that a bit of
history of which I have personal
knowledge may be useful. My
relationship with Columbia began as
a graduate student in 1914. My
major professor was the distinguished
Charles A. Beard.
In 1917 the trustees summarily
dismissed Prof. James M. Cattell, a
noted psychologist and full professor.
Also, as I remember, two minor
faculty members also were fired.
The reason given but not clearly
understood was the opposition of
these men to our entrance into
World War I. There were also
abrasive relations between Cattell
and President Butler. There was a
great uproar at the time and Beard
resigned in protest against the
action of the trustees. The trustees
apparently decided that never again
would they interfere in faculty
affairs.
When I was appointed in 1923, the
choice was not only made by the
faculty but the department in which
I became a member. I was told that
the trustees' confirmation was only
perfunctory. The confirmation of
my appointment signed by the
secretary of the university said that
my appointment "will continue during
the pleasure of the trustees."
That was what has come to be
called "tenure." In all the years that
followed until my retirement, all
appointments and promotions were
decided by the various faculties of
the university through the departments.
Faculties also determine
what should be taught and how.
Thus their power over academic
matters is relatively supreme.
On one occasion the dean of
Barnard College, Virginia Gildersleeve
told me that she conceived of
her office as mostly ceremonial and
budgetary. She said that she was
there "to keep the faculty happy."
In the 1940s a trustee friend of
mine told me that Mayor La Guardia
was not going to run for a fourth
term and wished above all to be
appointed a professor in the department
of which I was a member. I
asked him why the chairman of the
trustees, Frederick Coykendall, did
not suggest the appointment to our
department. "Oh," he answered,
"Fred is for the appointment but he
knows that if the faculty should
know this it would kill the idea." I
consulted the members of my department.
The answer was "No."
The appointment was not made.
My point in this recital is to show
how completely in this institution,
along with other major institutions,
appointments and educational policies
are determined by faculties. In
the course of the past four decades
administrators and trustees were
relegated to merely routine chores.
So far as the students are concerned,
the faculties are supreme.
But in the convulsions now shaking
our institutions, the presidents
and the administrators have been
more or less innocent victims of
student resentment. They are harassed,
attacked and beleaguered by
the students from whom they have
been literally isolated by the faculties.
If, as I believe, student unrest
is largely rooted in the quality of the
education they are getting, the
demonstrators are barking up the
wrong tree.

These faculties claim ascendancy
in many disciplines. They are the
leaders in science and technology;
they teach people how to write
books and how to explain the past,
but they have not yet been able to
tell us clearly what is wrong with
the institutions which they largely
control.
They claim expertise in human
behavior, but they can't agree about
the behavior of the students they
see every day. There are huge
departments of government in which
they tell governments how to
govern, but they cannot govern
themselves and their students.
And when institutions are disrupted
and paralyzed by student
attacks, faculties show themselves
to be wholly divided among themselves
or critical of what administrators
have done to restore order and
keep the institutions open. In short,
the maintenance of that peace and
order, without which there can be
no education, is frustrated by the
faculties. This not only encourages
student unrest but makes academic
freedom meaningless.
