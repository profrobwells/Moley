History has a way of reciting the
fortunes of nations in terms of great
commanders and statesmen who,
from time to time, have dominated
the forces that determined the ebb
and flow of world affairs. But more
often than not, there were students
removed from the vicissitudes of
action who saw deeply into the
meaning of political and military
power and who, in their findings
and prophecies, provided guidance
for nations and their leaders. Such a
Nestor was Alfred Thayer Mahan,
whose great books in the 1890s on
sea power have profoundly in-
fluenced strategy of Britain, Germa-
ny, Japan, United States and, more
recently. Soviet Russia.
Mahan was born at West Point in
1840 and he was raised among books
and amid the fine thinking and the
discussion of men whose profession
concerned military strategy and
world affairs. His father was profes-
sor of military engineering. When
Mahan was 12, Robert E. Lee came
to the academy as superintendent,
George B. McClellan was a junior
engineer officer and Ulysses S.
Grant was a student. Despite this
Army background, the boy's inter-
est turned to the sea, apparently
influenced by the stories of Marryat
and of naval historians. He attended
Columbia College and in 1856 was
made a midshipman at Annapolis.
He was rated there as a brilliant
student.
After Annapolis, he served at sea
as an officer on various naval
vessels, but after 1370 he seemed to
have considerable time for study
and in 1885 was assigned to the new
Naval War College.
The college was short of money,
talent and books, But Mahan sup-
plied the need for a text by writing
his great seminal work, "The In-
fluence of Sea Power Upon History,
1660-1783." Seven years later he had
added two more books on the
subject, "The Influence of Sea
Power Upon the French Revolution
and Empire" and "The Life of
Nelson." This trilogy constitutes his
contribution to an understanding of
the influence of sea power upon the
rise and fall of nations.
Sea power, as Mahan defined it, is
the total influence on the high seas
of a nation and the ancillary means
of supporting its vessels. This
includes its navy, its merchant fleet,
including its fishing and exploratory
ships, plus its far-flung bases for
repairs and refitting. The navy is its
potential to keep sea lanes open in
war and peace:
In elaborating his theme, Mahan
traced his subject back to the Punic
Wars when Rome by its superiority
on the Mediterranean frustrated
Hannibal's almost successful inva-
sion by land. And his books ended
with the defeat of Napoleon by the
British despite French victories on
the Continent.

Thus Mahan proved that there had
always been the reality of sea over
land. But no one had so comprehen-
sively explained this essential factor
in world affairs.
The British were the first to
recognize the immense importance
of Mahan's writings and he was
acclaimed without restraint over
there. One of the first to grasp his
meaning in the United States was
Theodore Roosevelt, whose actions
in the Navy Department and as
President were guided through his
close association with Mahan.
The British government, spurred
by the German threat, greatly
strengthened its own fleet in the
years before World War I. In the
United States, as we all know, T.R.
was the first President to dedicate
himself to naval construction. He
said, "In the vitally important task
of convincing (the American people)
of naval needs, Mahan stood alone.
There is no one else in his class or
anywhere near it."
Since 1950 Soviet Russia's, merch-
ant marine, plus formidable naval
construction, has moved up to open
competition with the United States.
In the crisis that now faces the
United States in the Pacific and
Indian oceans, the relevance of
Mahan is quite clear, Our confroma-
tion with the Soviets seems inevi-
table, not necessarily in hot war but
in potential control of the great sea
routes,
