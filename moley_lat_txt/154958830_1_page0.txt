'Extremist Groups' Decline Seen
as One Result of GOP Nomination

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

During all of the debate
at the San Francisco
convention over what was
called extremism, there
was no effort at all by
those who projected the
issue to define what was
meant by the word.

If the subject was raised
for purposes of reasonable
discussion of issues, this
would have required the
substitution of an entirely
new platform. But it was
not raised for that purpose.
It was a political
gambit to injure Sen.
Goldwater's chance for
nomination.

And by following the
rules of politics, which do
not always follow the rules
of reason, the substitute
amendment defended by
Gov. Rockefeller was
aimed at the John Birch
Society, but to stress guilt
by association there were
also named the Communists
and the Ku Klux
Klan.

★

The amendment defended
by Gov. Romney
omitted names but merely
would have put the party
on record as opposing extremism.
Again the rules
of politics were invoked.
For if the Romney
amendment had supplied
a definition in terms of
government policies, he
would have divided his
support. For everybody
has his own definition of
what is reasonable and
what goes beyond what is
necessary to reach an objective.
Hence, his was a
political gambit, too.

I am not denying the
existence of organizations
some of whose tenets I
regard as extreme in the
sense that they go beyond
what is necessary to reach
a desirable objective. To
cite one example, I believe
it is silly to advocate the
repeal of the income tax
amendment, although I
believe that the graduation
which now prevails
should be less steep.

There are, I would estimate,
50 to 100 organizations
which advocate
measures which I regard
as extreme. But in most
cases they also advocate
some perfectly normal and
desirable general objectives.

I have always believed that these organizations
are wasting valuable energy and money which
would better be channeled into a political
party. Also, I have often written in columns and
books my disagreement with some of their charges
and proposals.

But I have also recognized that many people
have supported or joined these organizations (and
here I am speaking of those that call themselves
conservative) because the Republican Party has
failed for many years to provide for them a congenial alternative.

Now, however, the Republican Party has
adopted a statement of principles and nominated
a candidate that do present a real alternative to
the ruling majority of the Democratic Party, the
President, and the majority in Congress. The effect
of this will be to draw away the support of the
more reasonable people from such non-political
organizations.

There will, to be sure, be fringes in such organizations
who will remain irreconcilable.

They cannot be absorbed and so they will
march on into oblivion. Their support will decline,
and their organizations will decline and for the
most part die.

::

I cite the decline of the Socialist Party since 1933.
After Roosevelt inaugurated his New Deal and
shaped his party, most of the milder Socialist ideas
were absorbed and most Socialists became Democrats.
Roosevelt, to be sure, rejected the standard Marxian schemes
and public ownership and operation of all industry.

★

My point is that when a major party adopts a real
alternative, those who are not unreasonable leave
their splinters and join it. So we shall hear less
and less about extremism. Only the Democrats will
use this word to pound Goldwater and their Republican
opponents. The more violent Birch leaders, like Robert
Welch, will sink into "innocuous desuetude." They will
realize, like Othello, that their "occupation's gone."
