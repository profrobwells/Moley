Rep. Miller Exactly Fits Pattern
for a 20th Century Vice President

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

SAN FRANCISCO—If,
as has been reported, the
nominee for the Vice
Presidency on the Repub-
lican ticket will be Rep.
and National Chairman
William E. Miller, it will
be a recognition of the en-
tirely new concept or une-
importance of that once-
neglected office.

The days of the Throt-
tlebottoms have come to
an end. What is needed
now is a Vice Presidential
candidate who can bear a
heavy responsibility in the
campaign and if he is
elected, carry out impor-
tant missions for the
President, both as his rep-
resentative in good-will
tours abroad and as an
administration spokesman
over the nation at home.

Miller is equipped to
perform these duties with
great effectiveness. He is
without doubt the best
debater in the Republican
Party; he is, because of his
congressional experience,
thoroughly acquainted
with the issues; he is ex-
ceedingly quick to see and
exploit a weakness in the
opposition; he has been a
vigorous and effective cri-
tic of the liberal policies of
the Kennedy-Johnson
administration, and no one
is better acquainted with
Republican leaders in all
the states of the nation.

★

He has another advan-
tage. He is one of a group
of relatively young Re-
publican members of the
House of Representatives
who, because of their hard
work, their mastery of the
issues, and their construc-
tive work as minority
members of important
House committees, are the
real hope of the future of
the Republican Party.

The old reasons for se-
lecting a Vice Presidential
nominee are of less im-
portance now, but even
judged by those conside-
rations Miller fits the pat-
tern.

He is an Easterner,
while the probable nomi-
nee for President is from a
small western state. He is
a New Yorker who has not
been prominently identi-
fied with the old wheel-
horses of the eastern fac-
tion of the party. He is no
exponent of the "me-too"
liberalism of the Rocke-

fellers, the Deweys, the
Scrantons and the Lodges.
He is a Catholic and
thus assures a counter-at-
traction if Robert Ken-
nedy is chosen by John-
son.

It was Richard Nixon
who fully realized the
potential of the Vice
Presidency. He was ex-
perienced in politics, while
Gen. Eisenhower was a
novice. His campaigning
in 1952 was comprehen-
sive and effective. And as
Vice President he did all
that a man could do to
keep the Republican Party
alive in the states. He
served with distinction
abroad.

The selection of Lodge
to run with Nixon in 1960
was urged upon Nixon
despite his earlier pre-
ference for Rep. Gerald
Ford of Michigan.

The two people who
pressed the selection of
Lodge were President
Eisenhower and former
President Hoover. He was
accepted by the dominant
figures at the conven-
tion because they re-
garded him as an effective
debater in the United Na-
tions whose image had
been carried to millions of
Americans on the televi-
sion screen.

But the qualities
which commended him in
Billingsgate with Soviet
and satellite delegates in
the United Nations were
not suited to contacts with
American audiences. His
manner is arrogant and
supercilious. He behaves
generally with a Brahman
aloofness.

After Lodge was nom-
inated and given a speak-
ing schedule, he was life-
less and laggard. He of-
fended innumerable local
and state Republican
leaders. His words lacked
conviction and force. No
doubt, the margin of vic-
tory which Nixon badly
needed was lost by
Lodge.

★

It is to be hoped that the
Lodge experience has
ended the silly practice of
"balancing" the ticket for
ideological or sectional
reasons. It is the candidate
for President who sets the
pattern and tone of the
campaign.

The Presidential can-
didate needs a colleague
who shares his views, is
willing to work, and has
the capacity to perform a
major task in a campaign
and in a new administra-
tion.
