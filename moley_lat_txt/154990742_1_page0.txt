Medicare Cost Would Place Heavy
Burden on Young Man and Family

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

As you approach this
strange scheme called
Medicare from almost any
point of view, your
amazement mounts. How,
even in the make-believe
of politics, can this be ta-
ken seriously as national
policy? Let us consider on
this occasion only the
burden it would place
upon a young worker who
is 30 years of age in 1964.

This man started to
work for a corporation
when he was 25. He mar-
ried on the strength of his
new job. He made a down
payment on a home and
on its furnishings and on
an automobile. Also, he
took out insurance on his
life and for medical and
hospital care and on his
possessions.

Now he is 30. He has
two children and, despite
pay raises, he has real
problems in meeting his
financial obligations.

*

He realizes that the next
10 years are likely to be
the most demanding of his
life. Cars and carpets and
TV sets and washing
machines and refrigera-
tors are going to wear out
and will need to be re-
placed. His growing
children need the things
that suit their ages, and
his wife must look well.

One September evening
he read in the newspaper
that the Senate has passed
something called Medi-
care. And so the next af-
ternoon he stopped on his
way home to see the man
who always helped him
with his income tax re-
turns and other financial
problems. His question
was. "If this thing gets to
be a law, what does it
mean to me?"

â˜…

His adviser spread out
some papers on his desk
and replied:

"If this passes, your so-
cial security tax on $5,600
of your income will go up
from $174 this year to $238
in 1965. There are other
increases ahead, and
when you are 37 you will
pay $291.20, or $117.20
more than now. Your em-
ployer will pay an equal
amount for you. But he
can pass on this cost in the
prices of what he sells.
And so will other em-
ployers. So you will be
paying more for things
that you buy."

"What do I get for all
this money that I pay?"

"Thirty-five years from
now you will be entitled to
50 days in a hospital and
150 days in a nursing
home. Your wife will be
entitled to certain benefits
also."

After dinner our be-
wildered friend dropped
into his Democratic dis-
trict club and told his
story to the wordly wise
district leader.

"Don't worry," said the
leader; "our President
knows what he is doing.
This Medicare plan will
please old folks. They will
know that they won't have
to worry about sickness.
And in an election like this
-our candidates need all
the votes they can get."

"But what about guys
like me? We seem to be
paying for a lot of old
people now and when we
get old all that we get is a
turn in the hospital or
nursing home. How do I
know I will be sick then?
What's going to happen
during all these years that
I will be paying these
higher taxes? I have
trouble enough now to
meet all my bills, with a
family growing up and
other expenses.

The leader beamed with
that special benignancy
due a loyal party follower
who means two votes for
the ticket.

"Don't bother your head
about that, young man.
There's a lot more like
you. More, in fact, than
the old folks who will get
Medicare now. Before long
the party will take care of
you. It will put through a
law to give free medical
services for everybody-
free doctors, dentists, and
everything. They did that
in England and made ev-
erybody happy. This man
Johnson is a great
statesman. Didn't you
hear him say in Atlantic
City something about the
Great Society? That's his
plan for the future. Ev-
erybody will get theirs
then. But we have to get
things one at a time. The
word is 'moderate.' We
don't want to stir up too
many extremists this
year."

At home the wife heard
the news with enthusiasm.
And she said, "That's the
kind of party to belong to.
I heard somebody in At-
lantic City say it was the
party of hope. So we are
going to hope for the best."

"I don't know," her
husband answered. "Hope
can't pay the bills we are
going to have for the next
35 years."
