Campaign Dominated
by Fear, Near-Panic

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In all the years during
which I have been at least
an observer of Presiden-
tial campaigns, I have
never witnessed an in-
stance in which public
fear and near-panic have
so dominated the scene as
now.

The nearest parallel, I
believe, was in 1896. But I
was then a very small boy
attending a country school.
Contemporary
sources
tell us, however, that the
Boy Orator of the Platte,
William Jennings Bryan,
created something of a
panic in conservative
quarters.

This was reflected in
almost hysterical editorial
comments in the Republi-
can press. Even after the
votes were counted and
there was assurance that
sound money and moth-
erhood would still prevail,
the echoes of this fearsome
outery continued.

A big New York news-
paper said with a sigh of
relief that we had been
saved from a horrible fate.
Its post-election editorial
made the comment that
Bryan was only the nom-
inal head of the conspiracy
that threatened the nation.

*

Bryan was only nominal
"because the wretched,
rattle-pated boy, posing in
vapid vanity and mouth-
ing resounding rottenness,
was not the real leader of
that league of hell. He was
only a puppet in the
blood-imbued hands of
Altgeld, the anarchist, and
Debs, the revolutionist,
and other desperadoes of
that stripe. But he was a
willing puppet. Bryan
was willing and eager.
None of his masters was
more apt than he at lies
and forgeries and blas-
phemies and all the
nameless iniquities of that
campaign against the Ten
Commandments."

But as an American
poet said years later, "time
had its way" with John
Peter Altgeld. Sober his-
tory now portrays him as
having been a kindly,
courageous man who, as
governor of Illinois, had in
1893 pardoned three par-
ticipants in the Hay-
market riot because he
believed they had been
denied a fair trial.

Eugene Debs, convicted
during World War I be-
cause of the testimony of a
man who never forgave
himself for his wrong, was
pardoned by Republican
President Harding. And
while Bryan continued to
espouse unpopular views,
he was never a peril to the
republic.

I cite the foregoing to
suggest that the vitupera-
tion now against Barry
Goldwater in some sec-
tions is getting out of
hand. Whatever may be
our judgment about his
capacity to be President,
he is, in the forthright,
honest habit of the man,
raising questions which
need to be raised.

*

He has violated some
political taboos and has
said a number of things
with which many Ameri-
cans disagree. But he has
presented a choice to the
American people, and
they and they alone will
make the decision in
November.

And no one of us is wise
enough to say now that
the Goldwater impact on
American thinking will
not be productive, even if
he loses, of a great many
revisions of national policy
in future years.

It was that way with
Bryan. His monetary
ideas were naive even in
his time. He held that the
remonetization of silver
would ease a shortage of
money which was crush-
ing American agriculture.
That shortage was cor-
rected later not by "free"
silver but by new dis-
coveries of gold.

*

Theodore Roosevelt
substantially made the
same charges as Bryan
had made against a ruth-
less plutocracy and helped
to accelerate reforms that
were in the long run be-
neficial.

Now the shoe is on the
other foot and McKinley is
excoriated by the pre-
sently dominant party.
But McKinley did achieve
what he promisedâ€”sound
money and industrial re-
vival.

So in the remainder of
this campaign, let us not
be too dogmatic about the
rights and wrongs. And
above all, we should as
Americans put aside the
unreasoning fears that
prevail.
