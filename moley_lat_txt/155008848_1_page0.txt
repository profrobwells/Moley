Local Organization Seems the Key
to British Conservatives' Upsurge

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is strange in a country
like ours, where organiza-
tions of every sort pop up
to solve every possible
problem, that the vital role
of organization in politics
is so largely neglected in
political news and com-
ment. But good organiza-
tion can beat poor orga-
nization in an election,
even when its candidate is
inferior and its issues
barren of meaning.

That is why for the past
two years almost everyone
in the United States who
has commented on British
politics has assumed that
the Labor Party would
win with ease in this
year's general election. As
late as last spring, all the
auspices were pro-Labor.
Conservatives had lost
many by-elections, and
when their candidates did
win, their margin was less
than in the big Conserva-
tive year 1959. Local elec-
tions showed big Labor
gains. The old and almost
defunct Liberal Party
began to pick up votes.
The inevitable polls ran
heavily in favor of Labor.

It seemed after the
Profumo scandals and the
retirement of Prime Mi-
nister Macmillan that
nothing could save the
Tories from disaster. And
the new Prime Minister,
Sir Alec Douglas-Home,
seemed to be an unim-
pressive leader.

Then this summer the
Conservatives showed
strength in by-elections
and the polls began to
shift.

Published polls came as
a new political gadget to
the British long after most
intelligent Americans had
realized their fatal defects.
And in 1959, before the
general election on Octo-
ber 8th, the newspapers
were full of them. The
Gallup poll that year was
woefully wrong, because it
failed utterly to anticipate
the immense Conservative
victory. But this year the
British are still reading
these predictions with in-
terest.

While a recent Gallup
poll still gave Labor a
majority, other polls were
beginning to show a small
Conservative margin.
Close observers say that
the Gallup poll is likely to
be wrong again, not only

because of the small sam-
pling on which percenta-
ges are based, but because
it does not cover the hea-
vily Conservative voting
strength in Northern Ire-
land where seven House
members are chosen.

But polling aside, the
Conservative prospects
are bright. Prime Minister
Douglas-Home is showing
remarkable skill and force
as a leader. He is making
excellent speeches and is
giving close attention to
the constituency organi-
zations.

A year or two ago, it
seemed that the old and
reputable Liberals were
on the way to increasing
their feeble strength in the
House of Commons, or
that they would at least by
running a considerable
number of candidates in
the constituencies cut vi-
tally into the Conservative
vote. Their hopes have
declined this year,
however.

But the greatest advan-
tage which the Conserva-
tives will have is better
organization in the consti-
tuencies. The "agents" or
managers are special, sal-
aried, full-time, and expe-
rienced operators. In a
sense they are the party's
professional civil service.

Labor agents are not so
well paid and are general-
ly not so competent.
Hence, the election may
well turn on the capacity
of hundreds of agents in
the constituencies to get
out their respective votes.
This is always the high
point in a British election
battle. The winning factor
will not be what the party
heads say over the BBC. It
will be the little fellows
who have been laboring
for five years to identify
and know every vote for
which they are responsi-
ble. In the three weeks of
campaigning, their job is
to get out those that they
know will vote for their
party. In their little-known
local areas the decision
will be made, and there
the Conservatives may
well win another grant of
power.

★

It is not likely that the
Conservatives will win by
the 100-odd seat majority
of 1959. It will more likely
be half that number. But if
the Conservative majority
is 30 or more. Prime Min-
ister Douglas-Home's
government will be stable
for a long time. If it is
smaller than, say, 20, there
may well be another elec-
tion next year.
