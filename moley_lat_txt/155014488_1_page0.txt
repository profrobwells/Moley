Dissension, Conservative Party
Peril GOP Chances in New York

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Gov. Nelson Rockefeller
has said with no incon-
siderable pride that the
Republican Party in his
state is as well fixed as it is
in Kansas. The Republi-
can Party in New York
has the governorship, it
controls both houses of the
Legislature, and it has two
U.S. Senators and most of
the congressional seats.

This, however, is a very
deceptive picture of Re-
publican strength in the
Empire State in 1964. For
its prospects in this cam-
paign are overcast with
large dark areas, and only
here and there brightened
by a touch of sunshine.

The most serious factor
in the situation is the
confused state of mind of
thousands of normally
Republican voters. If their
ideological convictions are
conservative, they face a
number of vital questions.
Unless they can find an-
swers to their questions,
many will, as one man
said recently in a private
conversation, be on the
golf course on election
day.

Others will seek Repub-
lican unity in response to
the pleas of former Vice
President Richard Nixon,
former Gov. Thomas De-
wey and Gov. Rockefeller.
Still others will split their
tickets and vote for Pres-
ident Johnson and Sen.
Hubert Humphrey at the
national level and Sen.
Kenneth Keating at the
state level. Still others are
solidly for Sen. Barry
Goldwater and Rep. Wil-
liam Miller and will, be-
cause of the appeal for
party unity, vote the
straight Republican ticket.

The ensuing Republican
confusion would be great
enough in any event, but
the young people who
organized the Conserva-
tive Party have added a
further element of disu-
nity. Two years ago, when
this new party was orga-
nized and secured a place
on the ballot, it seemed to
me a highly inadvisable
political adventure. Its
purpose was apparently to
muster opposition to Gov.
Rockefeller and Sen. Ja-
cob Javits, who were
running that year, to cut
into their voting strength
and thus to demonstrate
popular opposition to the
liberal policies of these
two gentlemen. The Con-
servatives, however, said
they were creating a
counterforce to the New
York Liberal Party which,
because of the threat it
presents, moves the De-
mocratic Party further
toward ultra-liberalism.

But the Liberal Party is
in everything but name a
Democratic satellite. It
endorses Democratic
candidates and it helps to
elect Democrats. The
Conservative Party, on the
other hand, has achieved
no such working ar-
rangement with the Re-
publican Party. It still
remains a force of inde-
terminate size which
draws votes from Repub-
lican candidates and thus
contributes to the election
of Democrats.

It seems to me that after
the nomination of Sen.
Goldwater for President
the New York Conserva-
tive Party lost the major
reason for its existence.
But it persists in main-
taining its identity and has
nominated candidates for
a number of offices, in-
cluding the U.S. senator-
ship. Also, the presence of
its candidates on the ticket
will no doubt intensify the
efforts of Sen. Keating and
others to draw ideological
lines of dissent from those
of Goldwater and Miller.
Thus, the persistence of
the Conservative Party
would tend to diminish
any hope that Goldwater
and Miller can carry New
York state in November.

It is true that the Re-
publican Party, by deny-
ing the Conservative
Party the right to list the
duly selected Republican
electors on its ticket, acted
unwisely. For Rockefeller,
the titular head of his
party in New York, has
declared his support of
Goldwater and Miller. It
would redound to Rocke-
feller's credit if Goldwater
and Miller could carry the
state or at least make a
creditable showing in the
election.

If Keating and other
Republican candidates
persist in their detach-
ment from the national
ticket, the result will be a
state Republican Party
quite separate from the
national body. This de-
tachment virtually con-
cedes New York's elec-
toral votes to the Demo-
cratic national ticket.

Perhaps these two Re-
publican parties will con-
tinue after the election;
perhaps not. But this is the
situation which confronts
New York Republicans
this year. And it is most
unfortunate for the two-
party system that calmer
judgments have not pre-
vailed on all sides—more
reasonable attitude by the
Conservative Party, by the
New York Republican
Party and by Sen. Keating
himself.

Goldwater has never
"written off" New York as
fighting ground. But for
reasons beyond his control
he now must win enough
of the 49 remaining states
to get a majority in this
year's election.
