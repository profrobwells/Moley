Homer Preston
With the passing of Homer
Preston, Los Angeles
has lost one of the finest
and most devoted civic
spirits that ever lived. His
vision and incredible labors
developed the Republican
Associates.
This organization has
become a model for the enlistment
of leadership in
the interest of the two-party
system in many other
areas.
It is no small task to
awaken businessmen to
their political responsibilities,
and in his efforts during
the past years Mr.
Preston was further handicapped
by a grievous physical
affliction.
It will not be easy to
find a replacement for this
dedicated man.
