Assaying of Election Requires
Look at GOP's Handicaps, Too
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the midst of the row
now going on among Republicans, I hope to offer
in this piece a caution
based on logic, reason, and
fair play.
In the first place, it ill
becomes Republicans who
either refused to support,
Sen. Barry Goldwater or
actively worked against
him to blame his defeat on
the way he conducted his
campaign. Two fellows are
in a fight. During the imbroglio a spectator reaches
in and trips one of the
combatants. Then after
the opponent has won the
fight, the man who interfered shouts that if the loser
had fought better he
would have won. Those
Republicans who failed to
help or actively opposed
Goldwater in this campaign should be the last to
blame Goldwater for his
loss.

In politics, as in many
other human affairs, nothing succeeds like success.
I know this well, because I
have not only been close to
many Presidential campaigns but was a participant in
one. In that one in
1932 which Roosevelt won,
there were plenty of instances in the campaign in
which the wrong thing was
said and the right thing
was omitted. But in the
volume of praise that followed victory, nobody
mentioned the errors, everybody praised the genius of the winner.
I have always since then
followed the rule of refraining from performing
a post-election autopsy on
the loser. A lot of people
right now who have had
no experience in politics
are popping up with "perfect" theories of how
Goldwater might have
won if he had said this or
refrained from saying
that. That happened in
1960, and I replied by
pointing out the factors
which contributed to Nixon's defeat and for which
he himself was blameless.
In this campaign Johnson made his mistakes, too.
But he won, and all his deficiencies are forgotten.
Now that it is over, Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller is playing the old cracked record
that we heard before the
convention — all the old
saws about the "main-
stream" and "moderation." And while he chooses
to remain irreconcilable, he is illogical enough
to call for party unity.
In all fairness, it is necessary in appraising a defeat
to take account of
the odds and handicaps
against which a loser contended. President Johnson
had in his favor the salient
elements of success —
peace and prosperity. He
had the Presidency and
could use his official status
most effectively. He was
opposing a divided GOP, a
minority party at that. He
also had an already organized party machine to
support him. This he inherited from his predecessor.
The candidate of a party
which is out of power
must throw together an organization in days and
weeks, and anyone knows
that organizations take a
long time to build. Goldwater's organization was handicapped by inexperience.
In many states Republican
organizations have no real
strength. In some, there is
no organization except on
paper. Despite these handicaps Goldwater made a
terrific effort and he
failed. To be sure, mistakes were made, but if
he had won, those mistakes would be forgotten....
Carlyle had words for
this in his immortal essay
on Burns: "Granted, the
ship comes into harbor
with shrouds and tackle
damaged: the pilot is
blameworthy: he has not
been all-wise and all-powerful: but to know
how blameworthy, tell us
first whether his voyage
has been around the earth,
or only to Ramsgate and
the Isle of Dogs."

When we assay the results of this election—and
we can't do it in a few
days after the election—let
us consider the handicaps
as well as the failures. In
common justice, let us not
put all the blame on the
one man at the head of the
ticket.
Richard Nixon is one
man who speaks from personal experience. He has
since the election pointed
out how hard it is on a candidate with fellow members of his own party dragging their feet. He is one
man, perhaps the most important man to evaluate
the future necessities of
the Republican Party.
