There's More Money
but Less Teaching
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In pointing to a critical
shortage of teaching talent
to care for the immense
growth of college enroll-
ments in the years imme-
diately ahead, John W.
Gardner, president of the
Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of
Teaching, gave as a major
reason the very large
sums now available for re-
search and writing.
The sums made availa-
ble from the federal gov-
ernment have increased
200 times since 1946 to
nearly $15 billion in 1964.
This money, much of
which is available to col-
lege teachers and holders
of Ph.D's and is passed on
through grants of all
kinds, leads the indivi-
duals concerned to avoid
teaching and seek distinc-
tion in written articles, re-
ports, and books. For as
Gardner says, the able
researcher gains a wide
reputation through publi-
cations, while the able
teacher is known only in
his academic community.
Moreover, such af-
fluence has led to "grants-
manship, job hopping, and
wheeling-dealing."
The expression "grants-
manship" means the pur-
suit and enjoyment of
grants given directly to
the individual to work on
a specified project, provid-
ing abnormal means of
pressure on his institution
for higher rank or higher
pay. "Job-hopping" is pos-
sible because he can re-
spond to a more favorable
offer from another institu-
tion and take his grant
with him.
This leads to another
loss, which Mr. Gardner
describes:
"There is a whole gener-
ation of able young faculty
members who never know
a time when affluence did
not prevail. Some of these
heavily - bid for young
people appear to have no
sense of institutional loyal-
ty whatever and simply
follow the offers where
they lead..."
And he makes this addi-
tional point: "The man
with a glittering reputa-
tion is often lured with the
promise of minimum
teaching duties. Indeed he
may be given the promise
that he will not have to
teach at all."
While Mr. Gardner does
not mention it, grants from
private foundations are a
large factor in the problem
thus created.
Finally, there is a big
bidding-up of college and
university salaries. For in-
stance, I recently learned
of a young and immature
teacher who received an
offer of $25,000 salary
from another institution.
This sort of thing lays a
heavy burden on already
financially hard-pressed
colleges and seriously cuts
into the teaching talent of-
fered to students.
The colleges and univer-
sities themselves must
bear a heavy load of re-
sponsibility, even some of
those whose presidents are
on Mr. Gardner's board of
trustees. Appointments
and promotions are gener-
ally based upon the writ-
ten product of a teacher or
prospective teacher. And
so the incentive is provid-
ed to "research" or write
at the expense of teaching.
Granting institutions —
the Federal government
and foundations alike —
should give their money
for research and writing
directly to the institution,
not to individuals, and
thus permit the colleges
and universities to allocate
it. And colleges and insti-
tutions should place less
stress on written work and
more on good teaching as
a basis of appointments
and promotions.
