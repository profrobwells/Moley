Permissiveness Has No
Place at a University
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A basic fact which rises
above the uproar at the
University of California is
that without discipline
there can be no meaning-
ful education. Discipline, I
grant, cannot be exclusive-
ly imposed by administra-
tive authority. Nor can it
be exclusively left to those
who teach. A part of the
task is self-discipline by
the student.
In rare cases an indivi-
dual can educate himself.
But our institutions have
been devised to help and
guide and, if necessary,
impose authority upon the
student's quest of the
equipment which he will
need in the world which
he will enter.
★
This apportionment of
responsibility for educa-
tional discipline has been a
problem in higher educa-
tion since those years of
political and social unrest
which preceded World
War I.
At that time, and during
the 1920s, a large measure
of authority and responsi-
bility passed from the
trustees and the adminis-
trative officers of colleges
and universities to the re-
spective faculties.
At the present time,
much of the making of ap-
pointments and promo-
tions, the curricula, and
the content of courses
have been bestowed upon
the teaching force.
In well-ordered institu-
tions, deans and pres-
idents hunt for new talent,
with such advice as they
can get from the profes-
sors in their respective
fields. After a satisfactory
teacher is located, the fa-
culty as a body approves
or disapproves before the
appointment is passed
upon by the trustees or re-
gents. With certain nota-
ble exceptions, this has set-
tled down to routine
★
But the issue raised at
the University of Califor-
nia is a new challenge. It
raises the question whe-
ther students—some
students, aided and encou-
raged in this instance by
some faculty members—
can nullify or remake
university regulations de-
signed to promote orderly
classroom and laboratory
operations and to maintain
law and order on the cam-
pus.
When some students—
and I emphasize some—
sought to overturn univer-
sity regulations by what
amounted to mob action,
there was definitely de-
fined leadership. Mob ac-
tion does not, except in ve-
ry unusual cases arise
from spontaneous combus-
tion. In any group larger
than two or three, someone
tells the others what
should be done.
★
And in this case some of
that leadership came from
outside the student body
itself. There are regula-
tions in force at the
university that prohibit ac-
tivities on the campus for
the purpose of planning or
organizing unlawful acti-
vity off the campus. This
was the nub of the protest.
The student ringleaders
in the demonstrations, as
in all cases of such politi-
cal action, use fine words
to justify their purposes,
such as "free speech."
This is wholly bogus.
There is hardly a college
in the United States which
does not have political
meetings on the campus,
and in most there are well-
recognized political clubs.
But the inciters of this
revolt took action which
one leader said was de-
signed to make it impossi-
ble to carry on normal
educational activities in
the university.
★
Is it the contention of
these rebels that they
should have imposed upon
them the administration of
the university, the selec-
tion of its faculty, and the
sort of education that is to
be offered?
Certainly not, for this
would involve responsibil-
ity which students cannot
carry. What they really
want is to have the Legis-
lature appropriate the…
ney, the administrative of-
ficers look after the house-
keeping, and the faculty
present the content of the
courses.
But when any regula-
tion is obnoxious to any
considerable number of
students, those students
would be permitted to
change it. That is permis-
sive education.
