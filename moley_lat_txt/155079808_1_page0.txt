House Submits Self
to Senate's Caprice
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The motto of the Floren-
tine House of Medici was
"Le temps revient." That
time returns, we are re-
minded, by the reappea-
rance of flowers in the
spring and their death in
the late autumn. Round af-
ter round, eternally. And
so it is with the wheel of
human events.
In March, 1910, a few Re-
publicans, aided by the De-
mocratic minority in the
House, hacked away the
power of Speaker Joseph
Gurney Cannon. The up-
set was so powerful that
Cannon threatened to re-
sign as Speaker but the
House, after humiliating
him, kept him on.

The leader of the revolt
was George Norris of Ne-
braska. Norris, the father
of TVA, is now the sancti-
fied hero of Democratic
liberals. But the House
majority has now measur-
ably returned, in a some-
what different form, the
Speaker's power which
Norris denounced 55 years
ago. The independence of
the Rules Committee
which the Norris reform
established in that wild re-
volution is now virtually
destroyed. And the House
by its own action has re-
nounced its vaunted inde-
pendence and has submit-
ted itself to the caprice of
the Senate.
On the first day of the
present session, the House
by a 224-201 vote made
two changes in its rules:
Rule XI was amended to
permit the Speaker to
bring a bill to the floor of
the House if the Commit-
tee on Rules adversely
reports a bill or fails to re-
port it within 21 days.
*
Rule XX was amended
to permit the Speaker, at
his discretion, to send a
House-passed, Senate-
amended bill to conference
despite objections that the
Senate amendments have
not been considered by the
House as a whole.
Chairman Howard W.
Smith of the Rules Com-
mittee, who in this revolu-
tion was the victim as was
Cannon in 1910, has point-
ed out that under the new
Rule XX the House major-
ity has deliberately denied
itself the right to consider
and debate legislation
passed by the Senate. For
in the future the House
will have to vote yea or
nay on vitally important
legislation brought out of
conference without a
chance for proper con-
sideration.
Smith also points out
that the 21-day rule (Rule
XI as amended) was tried
*Moley
in the 81st Congress and it
didn't work.
Most House-passed bills
amended by the Senate
are sent to conference by
unanimous consent. But
before the 1965 revolution,
a point of order by one
member could send a bill
with a controversial Sen-
ate amendment back to
the Rules Committee.
There it might die or be
voted down or be reported
back with a rule that the
House should debate the
Senate amendment.

It seems that during the
88th Congress the Senate
developed a pattern of at-
taching wholly unrelated
bills as riders on House-
passed bills. Indeed, in
some cases only the num-
ber and the enacting
clause of the original bill
remained. For example,
H.R. 11865 authorized
liberalization of the pre-
sent Social Security Act.
The Senate tacked on Me-
dicare.
Perhaps, as Smith be-
lieves, the pressures and
the blame he has hitherto
had to bear will now fall
upon the head of the
Speaker. For the Speaker
will have all the head-
aches now—pressure from
minority groups, from
Senators with pet projects,
and from an exacting and
domineering President.
Perhaps Smith will have
the last laugh.
