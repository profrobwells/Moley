Lesson for the GOP:
Do Your Homework!
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has long been the
cherished belief of politi-
cal philosophers that a ma-
jor virtue of democratic
government is the edu-
cation it provides for
people generally. Through
the great tumult of words
spoken and written about
political affairs, the citizen
learns slowly how to gov-
ern himself and his coun-
try.
Such a lesson has clear-
ly been learned when all
hands in the Republican
Party agree that Ray Bliss
of Ohio should be chair-
man of the GOP's National
Committee. For he repre-
sents no ideological faction
—liberal, conservative,
moderate, extremist, or
what you will. He is an or-
ganizer who knows how to
get out the maximum Re-
publican vote for candi-
dates in any election.

Pundits and politicians
have never seemed to
grasp the truth that the
reason for the success of
the Democratic Party is
not that it has had better
candidates or better issues.
It is that in the great ur-
ban centers where most of
the voters reside the Dem-
ocrats have been more ca-
pable of getting their peo-
ple out on election day.
They have the more effi-
cient political machines;
they have a most powerful
auxiliary in political labor
unions.
In short, Democrats do
their homework. Demo-
crats also have the help of
well mobilized minorities,
and when their candidates
get in office they never
forget the people who vot-
ed for them.
*
All this is not lovely or
lovable stuff. But it keeps
a party in power.
On the Republican side,
with the exception of
small, scattered bright
spots, organization has for
many years been neglect-
ed. In most of our cities
the Republican party orga-
nization is only nominal.
In some big cities the par-
ty officers at all levels
seem to enjoy a vested in-
terest in defeat. After the
Democrats take over, Re-
publican organizations sa-
tisfy themselves with only
the bits and pieces that fall
from the brimming table
of patronage.
Some of this Republican
neglect of organization is
because it is easier for
those of us who write to
discuss high matters of na-
tional policy. GOP fund-
raising dinners are embel-
lished by orations about
national ideals or by view-
ing Democratic policies
with alarm. Seldom does
anyone talk or write about
what is needed most—the
homely task of getting
people registered and to
the polls.
In past years the nation-
al chairmanship has been
held by part-time unpaid
people. In selecting Bliss,
the Republicans got a full-
time working chairman.
*
In Ohio his organized ef-
fort produced results, ex-
cept in 1958 and 1964. In
1958 when the Ohio GOP
was badly defeated the re-
sult was due to the fact
that Bliss’ advice was not
taken, but Bliss picked up
the pieces and in 1960 Ohio
had the largest majority
that Richard Nixon won in
any state.
Now as’national chair-
man he faces the same job
of building up and reorga-
nizing a shattered party. If
anyone can bring it back
to life in 1966, Bliss is the
man to do it. The Bliss pre-
scription for Republicans
is less talk and more work
in the precincts and the
grass roots.
