Yesterday's Dissent Is Today's
Orthodoxy, Backward Look Shows
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the advantages
of a long life and a sharp
memory is the capacity to
judge present trends of
opinion against the back-
ground of the past. A cur-
rent scare is recorded in
the mass of "literature" in
the forms of books and ma-
gazine articles about
"right wing" groups and
individuals and their pro-
paganda. The tremendous
majority for the safe and
comforting man in the
White House has not
stilled the fear in so many
places that the republic
and the sanctity of our life
are in dire peril.
I venture to suggest that
the ease with which wri-
ters of these frightening
warnings about "rightist"
groups get their material
in print is due to the sim-
ple fact that dissent is al-
ways more interesting
than conformity. One cri-
minal gets more space in
print than a thousand re-
putable deacons. And we
are living in a time when
conformity means agree-
ment that Federal bureaus
and bureaucrats are all ne-
cessary to our salvation.
â˜…
This carries me back to
the period immediately af-
ter the armistice in 1918
and into the early 1920's.
First there was the great
Red scare projected by At-
ty. Gen. A. Mitchell Pal-
mer in the dying days of
the Wilson Administra-
tion. Palmer's crusade pa-
ralleled the refusal of the
Wilson Administration to
recognize the de facto
government of Russia.
Then there came the
election of Warren G.
Harding and a return to
what he called the "nor-
malcy" which had pre-
vailed before Theodore
Roosevelt and others
had threatened the Re-
publican regimes of those
years and had ended up in
the great schism of 1912.
The Cabinet assembled by
Harding was designed to
suggest years of safe and
sane government ahead.
The dissent in those
days was not in the Demo-
cratic Party, or in what
was left of it after Hard-
ing's election. It was in
small groups of varying
degrees of radicalism.
Young college instructors
felt brave when they re-
quired "The New Repub-
lic" to be read by their
students, and in their clas-
ses they ventured to mut-
ter complaints about the
trustees and such conser-
vative college administra-
tors as Nicholas Murray
Butler. Small magazines
and other forms of propa-
ganda sprang up.
Some of this dissent was
so extreme as to be silly,
just as is some of the so-
called right-wing propa-
ganda now. But some was
sound and wholesome cri-
ticism of government poli-
cies which were in effect
for the greater part of a
decade. I might add that
within that period there
appeared a genuine litera-
ry flowering which was
the greatest in this centu-
ry. The old muckrakers
were supplanted by se-
rious writers and critics of
the prevailing conformity
such as Sinclair Lewis,
Henry Mencken, Theo-
dore Dreiser, and F. Scott
Fitzgerald.
Perhaps, I repeat, per-
haps, the so-called conser-
vative movement will yet
awaken us to the folly of
believing that salvation,
including the abolition of
poverty and the cure of
cancer, heart disease, and
paralysis can come from
larger congressional ap-
propriations. But the crea-
tive conservatives are still
in the wings.
I am not arguing here
for either of these Ameri-
can movements of dissent.
I am merely indicating
that both are common ma-
nifestations of a restless
non-conformity which is
always latent in American
life. I am pointing out that
dissent is not the peril that
some would have us be-
lieve. The republic sur-
vived the earlier move-
ments, and because of a
great economic crash they
gained ascendency. That
ascendency has since be-
come the orthodoxy we re-
cognize today.
What I am arguing for
now, as I did in those ear-
lier days in a small way, is
a bit of tolerance for those
who legitimately provide
the criticism of which they
believe the party system is
incapable. I grant that
some of the organizations
that have been springing
up over the past few
years, and indeed since
the November election,
are misguided and a few
are mischievous. I didn't
like the radical groups
back there in the 1920s
any more than I like the
Birchites now. Both have
done an ill service to the
ideology they professed to
support. But we must al-
ways recognize that ex-
tremes beget extremes.
As the wheel of opinion
has turned, the orthodoxy
of the 1920s has become
the non-conformity of the
1960s, and the dissenters
of those earlier days have
become the established or-
der of today.
Resistance to a public
trend is always whole-
some. For from the clash
of views there comes a
measurable stability.
