Two British Memoirs
Hold Lesson for GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I venture to recommend
two books for careful reading
by a number of Republican
leaders: National
Chairman Dean Burch,
National Chairman-elect
Ray Bliss, congressional
leaders Dirksen and Ford;
Bob Wilson, chairman of
the Republican Congressional
Committee, and also
Barry Goldwater and
Richard Nixon.
The books are the political
memoirs of Lord
Woolton and Lord Kil-
muir. The latter was, before
his elevation to the
woolsack, David Maxwell
Fyfe. These two men,
along with Winston
Churchill, were most responsible
for the revival of
the Conservative Party
from its crushing defeat in
1945 and for the momentum
which kept it in office
for 13 years.
The Kilmuir book was
published last year in England.
It is the story of
how a great party which
was almost obliterated
learned the hard way to
recovery.

The Conservative Party
had suffered great defeats
before—in 1830, 1846,
1880, and 1906. But the defeat
in 1945 was not only
unexpected; it was the
most crushing of all. What
made it the more remarkable
was that the party
had held power (with a
War Cabinet that included
members of the opposition)
during a war that
ended in victory. At its
head was the incomparable
Churchill.
The sweep of Labor was
overwhelming. Five Cabinet
members lost their
seats in the House of Commons,
along with 26 junior
ministers. Other famous
political leaders were defeated,
some never to return
to public life.
The new Labor members
descended upon
Whitehall like conquerors
and freely demonstrated
their contempt for traditional
amenities. Leading
Labor ministers such as
Aneurin Bevan made free
to taunt even the redoubtable
Churchill.
But during the year following
the defeat, Churchill
realized that he had
never considered party organization
as a factor in
politics. He had never had
chief party responsibility
in peace time. But he
called Lord Woolton back
to public life and made
him chairman of the party.
Woolton, who until the
war had been director of a
great retail store chain
and never a politician, applied
the rules of business
salesmanship to party rebuilding.
Woolton then
made David Maxwell Fyfe
chairman of a committee
Moley
on organization. This presented
the famous Maxwell
Fyfe Report, which
would be excellent reading
for every American
state chairman in 1965.
It developed plans for finances,
for the local and
central organizations of
the party, for the role of
the annual party conferences,
and the selection of
candidates. Most important
was the recruiting of
"agents" or managers, one
for each constituency—a
full-time, paid, professional
organizer.
With these preparations
and with a vast public disillusionment
because of
the blunders of the Labor
government, there came
the general election of
1950.
★
When that election was
called, the Conservatives
had established 527 constituency
agents. Labor had
only 279. And that was the
decisive difference. The
huge Labor majority was
reduced to 17. While Labor
increased its popular
vote by 1½ million, the
Conservatives polled 2½
million more than in 1945.
With this narrow margin,
the Attlee government
staggered on for 18
months. Then the Conservatives
took over and held
power until October, 1964.
Now the great strength
of the Conservative organization
is mustering
again, and no doubt the
party will once more take
power this year.
