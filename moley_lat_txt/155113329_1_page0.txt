Our 'Rotten Boroughs'
May Yet Be Reformed
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Goldsmith's "Deserted
Village" is, beyond its distinction as a permanently
popular piece of verse, an
18th century lesson in
economics.
The village he found deserted had been virtually
abandoned because, with
the coming of the steam
engine, factories grew in
the cities and workers and
small industries drifted
away from small towns.
The latter were depressed
areas in the 18th century.
This left thinly populated
areas with representation
in Parliament, and great
lords of the manor virtually
appointed the members
to Whitehall. Thus, those
areas were called "rotten"
boroughs.
In those days before a
paternal government
sought to keep people
where they were born,
workers moved to where
work was available. The
growth of the welfare
state in the United States
has tended to reverse this
time-honored way of progress.

With unemployment insurance, relief in various
forms, subsidized housing
and recreation, aid to
schools, hospitals, etc., in
areas too poor to provide
them, our liberal political
system has sought to preserve a "sentimental" concern for the individual.
Farm subsidies for "family
farms" are means of perpetuating uneconomical
farm operators. This is not
progress. It is reaction.
I am not unaware of the
human values involved. I
would favor help. But help
to move, not to stay put.
But as the power of
government grows, so do
the evils of politics increase. For whatever is
subsidized creates a vested
political interest in those
who represent depressed
areas. We already have
our own "rotten boroughs."
Many districts represented in the House have
untouchable members representing them in Washington.
President Johnson, with
his great power in distributing patronage, may
well see that these districts are kept secure.
They are the very heart of
the Democratic power.
This will happen in Appalachia. For to pour federal
money without discrimination has no lasting
economic effect. But it certainly creates long-range
political power.
These are "kept" areas.
Their populations stagnate
in an artificially created
subsistence. They contribute little to national
wealth, but they become a
lasting burden.
It is so with state legislatures as well. With long
neglect of reapportionment, vested interests
grow and are perpetuated
in sparsely populated districts.
I am firmly convinced in
principle that the Supreme Court's determination that one vote should
equal another in choosing
representatives is wrong.
And if I were in Congress,
I would support the Dirksen amendment.
But the practical effect
of forced reapportionment
may well be an advantage
in breaking the grip of local political monopolies. It
will also, if not halted by a
constitutional amendment,
be a strong means of balancing party control by
strengthening the Republican Party. For in the
South Republican strength
is in the cities and their
suburbs. In many states
the new growth in population is in the suburbs and
the areas beyond the
suburbs. These would gain
by reapportionment.
The irony is that the Supreme Court in aiming at
one objective has made another attainable.
