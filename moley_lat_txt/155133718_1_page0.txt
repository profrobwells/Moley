Johnson's Gold Plan
May Work Backward
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Most economic troubles
originate in psychological
factors, and remedies al-
most always have psycho-
logical objectives. In-
numerable banks have
been ruined not because
they were not able to meet
normal depositor de-
mands, but because many
depositors believed them
to be insolvent. People
rush to draw out their mo-
ney, not because they be-
lieve their money isn't
there, but because they
fear it will not be there
very long. And accumu-
lated fears end in the
locked door and the
drawn shutters.
In the light of this plain,
everyday human fact, let
us consider the Johnson
administration's request
the Congress remove the
requirement that Federal
Reserve banks hold gold
certificates equivalent to
at least 25% of their depo-
sit liabilities. It is not pro-
posed to remove the 25%
gold backing of our Feder-
al Reserve notesâ€”our own
currency.
The facts are: These two
reserve requirements in-
volve $13.7 billion in gold.
This presently ties up all
but $1.4 billion of our gold.
For there has been a drain
on our gold by foreign na-
tions and domestic manu-
facturing requirements
over several years, until
the amount left is dange-
rously small. Treasury Se-
cretary Dillon said in pre-
senting the administra-
tion's proposal that the
drain since January has
been $200 million, with
more expected. It is ru-
mored that the De Gaulle
government has in mind to
demand up to $350 million.
When and if the admi-
nistration's plan goes into
effect, there would be ad-
ded to the small amount of
our free gold about $5 bil-
lion more, which would be
subject to withdrawal by
foreign countries.
The psychological ques-
tions, then, are these:
Would this large new avai-
lable gold supply provide
that confidence abroad
which would stop or re-
strict the desire to turn
our dollars into gold? Or
would it accelerate the de-
mands?
The administration be-
lieves that "yes" is the an-
swer to the first question
and that "no" is the an-
swer to the second.
The administration's cri-
tics have different an-
swers.
The issue comes down
to the extent to which
foreign bankers and their
governments have con-
fidence in the soundness
of our dollar.
Those foreign bankers
and governments have full
information about our
budgetary policies, which
until four years ago were
guided by the traditional
concept that a balanced
budget was a desirable
goal, but which later ac-
cepted deficits as not only
tolerable but desirable and
essential to growth. The
latter policy is not in line
with foreign thinking on
the subject.
For more than a century
the British pound was the
major guide in interna-
tional finance. Only after
the devastation of two
wars, the rise of socialism
and the dissolution of the
British Empire did the dol-
lar supplant the pound in
international currency.
But as Dr. M. A. Kriz,
senior economist of the
First National City Bank
of New York, said in a re-
cent speech in Denver:
"The dollar cannot serve
as international currency
by divine right. Only a
strong and reliable dollar,
freely usable throughout
the world and command-
ing universal respect, can
be an international curren-
cy."
For this reason, Eu-
ropean governments and
bankers will want to use
dollars to buy our gold
when they see our dollars
at home losing their value
by inflationary deficits.
And the more gold we
have available, the more
will be their demand for it.
The Dillon assurance
that if we put things in or-
der here the lost gold will
flow back to us is fatuous.
For the premise is that we
will put our house in or-
der. And despite all the
contrived arguments of
the administration, it is
not putting its house in or-
der.
