Writings of Edmund Burke Could
Guide GOP Into Its Proper Role
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The English-speaking
nations have come to take
two-party government so
much for granted that
most of us fail to realize
how relatively recently it
originated. But the con-
cept of two parties-one
holding the power of
government, and the other
seeking that power-real-
ly originated 200 years
ago. Edmund Burke, who
never headed a British
government or party, and
who held no public office
except for a short time,
was the originator and
spokesman for party
government in England.
The written landmark
of this development,
which means so much in
the history of liberty, was
a pamphlet which Burke
wrote in 1768 and which
was published in early
1769. It was called "Obser-
vations on a Late Publica-
tion intituled (sic) 'The
Present State of the Na-
tion'."
When Burke wrote this
pamphlet, politics in Eng-
land was in a period of
transition. The great days
of the older William Pitt
had passed and the old
man had become the Earl
of Chatham. Leadership in
the House of Commons
passed from one to anoth-
er. Meanwhile, George III,
who in his best days was a
very capable monarch and
politician, was determined
to create one-party rule
under royal authority.

Burke was just emerg-
ing as a force in the Com-
mons, and he attached
himself to the Whig group
headed by the Earl of
Rockingham, which for a
few months had held of-
fice three years before.
The king, who had un-
limited patronage and fa-
vors to dispense, settled
himself in power for 14
years. During most of this
period his obedient prime
minister was Lord North,
whose baleful place in his-
tory was earned because
his blundering govern-
ment lost the richest of all
British possessions, the
American Colonies.
Burke, the intellectual
guide and spokesman for
Rockingham's party, was
determined that opposi-
tion to the king's govern-
ment should be strong and
consistent, despite the
grave emergency created
by the armed warfare in
America and later by war
with France.
The power of the king
to break into a minority
opposition was very great.
For he was the dispenser
of incalculable induce-
ments to leading Rocking-
ham Whigs, from Cabinet
posts to outright bribery.
In a monumental new
biography, "Burke and the
Nature of Politics," by
Carl B. Cone of the Univer-
sity of Kentucky (Univer-
sity of Kentucky Press),
there is a summary of
Burke's belief in the neces-
sity of opposition:
"Burke's 'Observations'
summarized his develop-
ing thought about politics
and party. As he had been
doing on the floor of the
Commons, Burke pleaded
the cause, not only of his
party, but of party gov-
ernment in general.
"His pamphlet contains
glimpses of a new idea in
English politics. A political
party out of office should
oppose the administration,
not in a factious spirit, but
in order to insure good
government.
"By 1769 Burke had ad-
vanced further toward an
appreciation of one of the
essentials of cabinet
government, namely, the
strategic importance of po-
litical parties, than most
members of his political
generation would in their
lifetimes."
For 12 years Burke held
his party together. For
there was plenty to say in
opposition. There were
great impediments to com-
merce—the very life of
England—created by bad
laws and administration.
The machinery of adminis-
tration was sorely in need
of reform. Government fi-
nances were in deplorable
shape. Corruption pre-
vailed not only in English
government but through
private exploitation in In-
dia.
On all these Burke
spoke and wrote not only
with incomparable elo-
quence but with a wealth
of hard-won detail. Finally,
after the loss of the
American war, Rocking-
ham came to power for a
short period. Rockingham
died, and the younger Pitt
took over.
There is a good deal that
Republicans might learn
from this history. Opposi-
tion is never so necessary
as when it is small in num-
bers.
