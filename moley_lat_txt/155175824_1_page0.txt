Gaudy Rayburn Building Contrasts
With the Man It Memorializes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
To know Sam Rayburn
was to love him for his
modest simplicity. He
stood out in a city where
pretense is dominant,
where display abounds,
and phonies flourish.
His life was austere simplicity itself. A bachelor,
he lived in what was by
Washington standards a tiny
apartment in a small
development called the
Anchorage, on a side
street near Du Pont Circle.
Like other friends of his,
I had a habit of dropping
in unannounced for breakfast or dinner. His "diggings," as he called this
residence, might have
housed an impecunious
bureaucrat.
In 1934 I visited him at
his home in Bonham, Texas. It was a modest place
with some land which
might have been the home
of a lower middle-income
farmer. As I remember,
his brother and a sister
kept the place while he
was absent in Washington.
When Rayburn was depressed because Roosevelt
refused to back him for
House majority leader, he
told me that if he could be
sure of an income of $200 a
month, he would quit Congress and return to Bonham.
It was ironical, therefore, that during a routine
session of the House in
1955 Rayburn should have
initiated the building of
the most absurd, expensive, and ill-managed
building in the history of
the United States capital.
His motion provided simply for an appropriation of
$2 million and "such additional sums as may be necessary" for acquisition of
a site and immediate construction of a House office
building.
From then on, the record was a story of gross
ineptitude, of wild extravagance, of grotesque planning, and indescribable
lack of foresight. Added to
all this, there were great
profits to the contractors.
No building, with the possible exceptions of the
Tweed Courthouse in New
York and the Pennsylvania
State Capitol, will have
such an unenviable place
in history.
It has been subjected to
denunciation and ridicule
as an architectural monstrosity. Its function as
working quarters for
House members and their
committees and staffs has
been violated with reckless abandon. In its years
of construction, unforeseen expenditures were
piled upon other unforeseen expenditures.
One example of that is
shown by the fact that in
the excavation for the
structure, deep water was
found under the soil, a forgotten stream once called
Tiber Creek. This required
nearly a million dollars to
shore up. But the struggle
to hold down the pressure
of underground water required an enormously heavy
superstructure. The
weight necessary to counter the water pressure was
supported by more marble
and more granite over still
more concrete, resulting in
more useless space above.
Many comparisons have
been made with what it
has cost to build other public and private structures
throughout the United
States, all of which indicate that the price paid by
taxpayers for the Rayburn
Building is beyond all past
experience. No one seems
to know what the cost will
be, but the most reliable figures run from $90 million
to $100 million.
A newly planned structure in Chicago will cost
about the same. It will be
built by an insurance company to house both offices
and residential apartments. It will have 31
floors of office space and
40 floors accommodating
700 apartments. Needless
to say, it will provide for
the needs of many, many
thousands of people. To be
sure, Washington could
not countenance a high-
rise structure. But when
we consider the countless—as of now—people who
will have room to work in
the Chicago building with
the number who will make
use of the Rayburn Building, the contrast is obvious.
For only 2,800 people
will "work" in the Rayburn Building. It provides
office space for only 169
House members, plus
room for nine committees
and their staffs.
A bit of humor is built
into the famous swimming
pool. The ceiling is so low
that if a full-sized member
should bounce from the
diving board, he would
crack his skull on the ceiling. If the present trend
continues, however, this
will be no problem. For as
more stately mansions rise
in Washington, statesmen
come in smaller sizes.
