String of Enclaves Better Oriental
Strategy Than Quit-and-Run Idea
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The quit-and-run critics
of the Johnson policy in
Vietnam suggest the easy
solution of complete de-
pendence upon air and sea
power. They, argue that
the United States cannot,
short of a collossal commit-
ment of ground forces, end
the war there and that
such a commitment would
surely bring Communist
China into the conflict.
They argue also that a
long-protracted conflict
against the guerrillas will
permit Red China to devel-
op nuclear power of pro-
portions which might even
render our navy powerless
to protect the Philippines
and Japan.
This concept that nu-
clear power, even devel-
oped years beyond Pek-
ing's crude beginnings,
can destroy our Navy is
absurd. Nuclear attack
upon the Seventh Fleet
could at best destroy very
few ships, while the sub-
marines now a part of the
fleet would remain im-
mune and capable of
powerful retaliation.
But even our Navy's ca-
pabilities and great air
power on our bases off the
long seacoast of China and
Vietnam could not prevent
a Communist domination
in Southeast Asia. A foot-
hold on the continent must
supplement them.

This has been forcefully
pointed out by Rear Adm.
John D. Hayes, USN
(Ret.) in various articles
published as late as April.
He describes the deci-
sion of the Truman admi-
nistration-or more direct-
ly, Secretary of State Dean
Acheson-to abandon con-
tinental China to the Reds
as incredible folly. Sound
military advice at that
time urged that the United
States should have main-
tained an enclave at Tsing-
tao in North China which
was held by us until 1949.
Rather than fighting in
the jungles of Vietnam, in
many places, and against
widely dispersed guerrilla
contingents, we should
hold a series of enclaves
along the coast. With these
firmly held by ground for-
ces our sea power could ef-
fectively prevent a
takeover for an indefinite
time,
Hayes concludes:
"American divisions, like
Roman legions, must stand
guard on our border,
which is today the littoral
of the oceanic world, main-
tained and supported by
sea and air forces. If any
become endangered, they
can be reinforced or with-
drawn."
This would be a far
more dependable position
than in the Vietnamese in-
terior, where Marines and
other ground troops are
constantly exposed to at-
tack on all sides by Com-
munist guerrillas.
That this strategy is
now a part of American
military thinking is report-
ed by Hanson W. Baldwin
in a most significant ar-
ticle in the New York
Times.
He says that our milita-
ry officers speak of an
"inkblot" strategy. It
would consist of establish-
ing a number of separate
enclaves around the Viet-
namese coastal areas.
Each would be held, as at
Da Nang, by United States
ground forces operating
under the protection of the
Navy and Air Force.
"Gradually, as supplies
and logistic facilities and
combat strength were
built up, each perimeter
would be extended...
Each of the principal en-
claves would center on a
port and depend upon sea
communications for its
supply, and each would in-
clude one or more air
fields. The spreading-out
process from each area
would be roughly similar
to an inkblot on a sheet of
blotting paper."

The major objective of
our Vietnamese operation,
beyond guaranteeing the
freedom of South Vietnam
is to hold for the free
world the great channels
of sea communication in
the Southwestern Pacific
and Indian Ocean.
This combination of sea,
air, and land power could
hold the line in Southeast
Asia for an indefinite per-
iod and protect the whole
area, including the Philip-
pines, from a Communist
takeover.
These strategic con-
siderations seem to have
no part in the thinking of
those critics of American
action whose policy sug-
gests that we should quit
and run from Vietnam.
The advice of these mis-
guided and purblind
people, if taken, would
merely move the fighting
to the Philippines.
