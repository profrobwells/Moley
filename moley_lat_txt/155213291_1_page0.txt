On Reapportionment, High Court's
Colorado Decision Was Fantartic
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The most fantastic of all
the decisions of the Su-
preme Court in its current
effort to create a new sys-
tem of representation in
the United States is the
case of Colorado. After
this, one might speculate
that the court would inva-
lidate the Dirksen Amend-
ment, if adopted, because
it had been approved by
the U.S. Senate which is
certainly the most obvious
denial of the "one man,
one vote" concept.
Colorado has not been so
reluctant to change its re-
presentation in the state
legislature as most states.
In the 86 years since Colo-
rado's admission to the
Union there were, until the
present imbroglio, seven
major reapportionments of
the legislature. One of
these was passed by the
state legislature; the oth-
ers, under the initiative
and referendum law.
In 1962, the year when
the Supreme Court began
its reforming in the case of
Baker v. Carr, citizens of
Colorado placed two reap-
portionment proposals on
the ballot. Amendment
No. 7 provided that the
lower house of the legisla-
ture be apportioned ac-
cording to population, but
that the upper house
should be apportioned ac-
cording to a combination
of population and other in-
terests. Amendment No. 8
provided that both houses
be apportioned according
to population alone. The
voters of Colorado ap-
proved No. 7 by a vote of
305.700 to 172.725. They re-
jected No. 8 by a vote of
311,729 to 149,822. Not only
did No. 7 win, but the ma-
jority of voters in every
county in which the plain-
tiffs in the case resided
voted for it.
Thereupon, the original
plaintiffs challenged the
constitutionality of the
newly adopted No. 7. Af-
ter an extended trial, the
Federal District Court re-
jected the plaintiffs' case.
The case was appealed
to the Supreme Court of
the United States. It re-
versed the District Court
in an opinion in which
Chief Justice Warren said
in part:
"An individual's consti-
tutionally protected right
to cast an equally weight-
ed vote cannot be denied
even by a vote of a majori-
ty of the state's electorate
. A citizen's constitu-
tional rights can hardly be
infringed simply because a
majority of the people
choose to do so."
Within two weeks after
this opinion was rendered,
a three-judge federal court
gave the state of Colorado
15 days to comply with the
edict. As Sen. Peter Domi-
nick explained to the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee:
"A hastily assembled
state legislature dutifully
complied and passed a
new apportionment plan
within the 15 days, even
providing for the subdis-
tricting of counties with
more than one senator or
representative as suggest-
ed by the Supreme
Court.
"Before signing this
measure Gov. Love sub-
mitted it to a three-judge
federal its ad
They approved it and
signed it into law. But
hardly before anyone
could breathe sigh of
lief, the Colorado Supreme
Court held the measure
unconstitutional becau
of the subdistricting of
some of the more populous
counties. The Colorado
court stayed its decision
until after the convening
of the General Assembly
in January of 1965."
This meant that the le-
gislature will have to pass
another reapportionment
before the November elec-
tions in 1966.
The rationale of the
Warren decision deserves
note. For it substantially
declares that while the
court is allegedly attempting
to let the majority of
voters make final decisions,
their views can be
rejected if the Supreme
Court disagrees.
Consistency is hardly to
be expected in a court
which has been over-
throwing earlier decisions
of the same court for more
than a decade.
