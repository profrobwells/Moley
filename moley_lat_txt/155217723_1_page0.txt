Wise, Kindly, Always Cautious
About Sums Up Bernard Baruch
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The characteristic of
Bernard M. Baruch which
impressed me most in the
30 years I knew him was
his great caution.. This
does not jibe with the com-
ments, in much of what
has been written since his
death, about his wild spe-
culations in his early
years.
I always regarded that
view of him as due to the
stories he told about him-
self in his memoirs and the
legends which so many
people fabricated about
him. He did not discour-
age the making of this
image of the young Wall
Street speculator because
there was a touch of the
romantic in him.
Herbert Bayard Swope,
who was very close to Ba-
ruch in the Wilson days
and later, told this about
President Wilson's com-
ment about his friend and
adviser:
Baruch, he said, had
characteristics of a certain
elephant. This animal, in
the course of his meander-
ing in search of food, came
to a bamboo bridge. He
tested its strength first by
resting some weight on
one foot on the bridge, and
then both front feet.
*
Then he stepped back
and said, "It's perfectly
safe. But I think I shall
stand here and see some
other elephant cross it
first."
If Baruch had gone into
the market with the skill
that he manifested at all
times, and had played
with large stakes, he
would have been one of
the very rich men of his
time. But measured by the
riches so many others ac-
quired, he had only a
modest accumulation.
He often said to me most
earnestly, "I am not real-
ly as rich as people think I
am." And on one occasion
I heard him mention $20
million as his net worth. It
may have grown later, for
he said that just as we
were recovering from the
depression. He could have
stood pat with what he
had and inflation would
have increased it. But I be-
lieved then that he was sa-
tisfied with what he had.
He always insisted upon
careful examination of the
soundness of a prospective
purchase, and he em-
ployed Gen. Hugh John-
son to do this research for
him. Johnson told me,
when he was in the New
Deal in Washington, that
Baruch got out of the
market in the spring of
1929 and that the crash la-
ter that year left him un-
scathed.
Caution characterized
his political activity, too.
Except when he vigorous-
ly supported Franklin D.
Roosevelt in 1932, it was
never clear exactly what
his political preferences
were. By inheritance he
was a South Carolina De-
mocrat, but he gave his ad-
vice to Presidents regard-
less of their political party
affiliation.
*
He was annoyed at me
when I wrote in 1939 that
in the pre-nomination days
of 1932 he had supported
Alfred E. Smith. He said
that his favorite had been
Gov. Richie of Maryland.
My information was that
he came to Chicago with
Smith's party.
But after the nomina-
tion he presented himself
at Roosevelt headquarters
early the next morning
and contributed Hugh
Johnson to the Roosevelt
cause.
Baruch was exceedingly
sensitive to criticism, and
that is probably why he
never accepted public of-
fice except for temporary
assignments.
*
Above all he was ex-
tremely loyal to his
friends. Many of them
owed much in material
terms to Baruch's genero-
sity. But beyond the
material was his wise
counsel, his encourage-
ment and his fidelity to
those he knew best and
who shared his trust and
affection.
The advice he gave to
Presidents, cabinet offi-
cers and members of Con-
gress was not always act-
ed upon. But those who
disregarded it lived to re-
gret it. For there was
something of the seer in
Baruch's perception of
public affairs.
"Speculation," he used
to say, "is not buying and
selling. It is the philoso-
phic contemplation of ulti-
mates."
We shall not see the like
of Bernard M. Baruch for
many years to come.
