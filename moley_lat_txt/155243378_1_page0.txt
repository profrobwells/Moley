End of Bracero Program Should
Be Every Housewife's Concern
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
More than a month ago I
wrote a piece pointing to
the deplorable effect of the
termination by our
government of the bracero
program, by which Mexi-
can nationals were permit-
ted to come north to help
harvest certain crops.
In response to that piece
and to a magazine article
on the same subject, I re-
ceived a considerable
number of letters. About
two-thirds of these sup-
ported my point of view;
others opposed it.
My information at that
time was what I learned in
a visit of three weeks to
various cities in Southern
California. The letters
since then from responsi-
ble people in California,
Arizona and Texas fully
confirm my original con-
clusions.
*
I had not, however, rea-
lized how far east the im-
pact of the termination of
the program was felt. One
of the most interesting let-
ters came from a gentle-
man who operates a
processing plant in Michi-
gan. I submit this man's
comment without identify-
ing him:
"Three years ago, after
20 years in the pickle busi-
ness, I put every penny I
had saved and could bor-
row into a small company
of my own. As all business-
men know, it takes a few
years to get on your feet
and show a few dollars
profit.
This year we are
forced to use domestic
workers to harvest our
crops. When informed of
this, our prospective grow-
ers for 1965 just shook
their heads and refused to
grow pickles. At planting
time our acreage had
dropped 66%.
"As net profit on pickles
is very low, I am going to
have to call off all my help
for all but eight weeks out
of the year. I wonder if
Mr. Wirtz (Secretary of
Labor) considers this help-
ing our economy? I know
of several large packing
companies in Michigan
who will have to reduce
employment to a mini-
mum this year, as ap-
parently the bracero pro-
gram will be non-existent
in 1965.
"Last Saturday we re-
ceived a large crew of men
from the Appalachian
poverty area. Within
nine hours after being
given cash advances,
transportation to their
housing and assurance of
work, 30% were on a bus
to Detroit and Chicago. As
we paid their transporta-
tion from their homes to
Michigan and advanced
them money, they had
nothing to lose. They did
have a vacation at our ex-
pense.
*
"The government has
required us to travel into
many states to interview
'young adults.' At Pensa-
cola, Fla., I interviewed 93
and ended up with four. I
hope that Mr. Wirtz has a
job for me some place un-
der the 'Anti-Poverty Pro-
gram,' as I will certainly
need it."
Another letter of parti-
cular interest, from a
foreign correspondent for
an American magazine,
presents the case from the
Mexican side:
"In addition to the
points you make, there's
another worth attention:
braceros come mainly
from the impoverished
northern areas of Mexico,
where the Communists are
working hard to capitalize
on the desperate poverty
of the people. To chop
these poor people off a
source of income they had
come to rely on seems like-
ly to make the work of the
Communist agitators still
easier.
"There has been an en-
ormous expansion of
acreage planted to toma-
toes for the U.S. market,
but most of that expansion
is farther south in Mexico.
In other words, the peons
who earned money as
braceros are not earning it
as growers.
"Mr. Wirtz's efforts to
help pay off political debts
to the U.S. labor unions
may result in moving a
major part of the produc-
tion over the border al-
together. We have export-
ed millions of factory jobs
in that way; now the
government seems to be
sponsoring a drive to do
the same thing with agri-
cultural employment."
In terminating the
bracero program, the
government, largely be-
cause of the influence of
Secretary Wirtz who
seems in turn to have been
influenced by the AFL-
CIO, has touched a nerve
center among consumers
everywhere.
*
But the real impact, I
am certain, has not yet
been felt. For certain
crops, notably the tomato
harvest, ripen in Septem-
ber, and the prices of
canned products will dur-
ing the entire fall and win-
ter reflect the difficulties
faced by growers when
their help from Mexican
labor is denied them.
My conclusion is that
this is not a matter which
involves the growers
alone. Every housewife
has an interest which may
well make itself felt for
months to come.
