California's Educational Offering
---Is It Too Much of a Good Thing?
The temptation is very
strong to devote my com-
ment, this week to the in-
credible outbreak of mob
violence in Los Angeles
and elsewhere. But so ma-
ny others have proffered
advice that I shall turn to
a more peaceful subject,
education, which is also
occupying the thoughts of
many responsible Califor-
nians.
California has probably
been more generous than
any other state in provid-
ing educational facilities
for the young and old. It
has taxed and bonded it-
self to the limit to offer all
kinds of teaching for ev-
erybody.
★
Its schools and colleges
have proliferated even
faster than its growing
population. Colleges and
universities, mostly good
ones, abound. Its high
schools are among the
best. And to supplement
its colleges and universi-
ties, it has led the nation in
setting up two-year colle-
ges, both vocational and
traditional.
As I have traveled about
I have also noted that ma-
ny California cities, even
small ones, have esta-
blished their own colleges
to meet the demands-not
necessarily the needs-of
young and old to study
and live at home.
It is about as easy to get
into a college in California
as to take a walk in the
park. And these days it is
safer.
But the head of a first-
class college there recent-
ly told me that California
has made it so easy to
move from high school to
college that it is hard to
get the students to settle
down and work, to say
nothing of going out to
find productive and re-
munerative employment.
He added, "When they hit
a good faculty in a good
college, many fail to re-
spond." The result is a
huge number of drop-outs.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A most interesting study
of the whole drop-out
phenomenon is in a report
this year by Edward San-
ders and Hans Palmer. It
shows that there is a very
large drop-out-23%-be-
tween the 10th grade and
high-school graduation.
Of those who graduate
from high school, a very
large percentage, 84.9, en-
roll in some college. That
is higher than in any other
state in the nation. Also
the proportion of those en-
rollees who take only part-
time college work is high-
er than in the nation as a
whole-31.4%.
But while so many enter
a college of some sort, an
astounding number, 73%,
do not graduate. Only
15.8% of students enrolled
in the tenth grade ulti-
mately graduate from col-
lege.
The study from which
these figures are taken is
purely statistical. It is left
to others to evaluate the
effects of this great attri-
tion and its causes.
Perhaps some will attri-
bute the drop-out tenden-
cy to the failure of the
teaching staff to interest
help keep the teen-age
girls, if New York's exper-
ience last week is any in-
dication of the attractive-
ness of the hairy enter-
tainers.
It would seem that this
enormous financial waste
can largely be attributed
to the easy standards of
admission. It used to be
quite a job to get the mo-
ney and the scholastic
equipment to get into col-
lege. But with the money
flowing from Sacramento
and Washington, it is real-
ly quite a task to stay out
of college.
This condition of easy
enrollment-it used to be
called "matriculation"-
does not prevail in the fine
privately endowed institu-
tions in California which
have stricter academic re-
quirements. But it certain-
ly prevails in the publicly
supported institutions.

Perhaps there is some
status in having been in a
college which induces so
many to enter, even for
what I heard one boy out
there call "giving college a
whirl."
There is another real
problem involved in this
situation. With the im-
mense growth of enroll-
ments there must be re-
cruited large numbers of
reasonably qualified
teachers.
Because of the tremen-
dous demand for teachers,
salaries have shot upward
to a point at which more
and more are choosing a
teaching profession rather
than some more exacting
and modestly compensat-
ed occupation. The result
is that as students prolifer-
ate the quality of faculties
declines.
It seems that in Califor-
nia and elsewhere the
need is to eliminate this
waste and thus provide
better education for fewer
but more durable students
and at less cost to the tax-
payers.
