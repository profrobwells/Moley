State Department Needs Half
the Staff and Twice the Quality
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Until now I have re-
frained from entering the
lists of controversy over
Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s
published article abusing
the State Department and
Secretary Rusk and re-
vealing the late President
Kennedy's intention to get
another boy to head our
great colossus in spats and
striped trousers.
I hope my esteemed col-
leagues and contempora-
ries will forgive me for say-
ing that in this instance
their criticism lacks per-
spective. For their atten-
tion has centered upon
Schlesinger's judgment in
quoting a dead President's
irritation at his foreign
service and criticism of a
man now in a responsible
office.
I shall leave this impro-
priety of Schlesinger's for
others to chew upon and
discuss the broader ques-
tion of the competence of
the 40,000 people of whom
Rusk is the nominal head.
For it would have been a
futile gesture to replace
Rusk with another secre-
tary of state unless that
new appointee were an ad-
ministrator who would
combine the personal pow-
er and skill in government
of a Charlemagne, a Na-
poleon or a Richelieu.

But no President who
wants to dictate foreign
policy himself wants such
a dominating figure as a
subordinate. In short,
don't shoot the piano play-
er when the discordant
music comes from an ill-
tuned and outworn piano.
Rusk, like his predeces-
sors, is not the man who
manages the vast bureauc-
racy concerned with
foreign affairs. In his deal-
ings with foreign govern-
ments he is merely a mild,
smooth articulator of poli-
cy made in the White
House. Back there in the
immense State Depart-
ment building he is the
prisoner of people and a
system which he inherited.
Here, in castigating the
American foreign service,
Schlesinger is on firm
ground, and his onslaught
may do some little good.
It has been almost exact-
ly 40 years since the last
real administrator of the
State Department, Charles
Evans Hughes, left the
Coolidge cabinet. Since
then we have had 10 secre-
taries of state. The person-
nel of the department has
grown in geometrical pro-
gression.
Some of the secretaries,
like Dulles, had the capaci-
ty to administer the de-
partment, but not the time.
Others, like Hull, had the
time but not the capacity.
In fact, when Hull was ap-
pointed he told Mr. Roose-
velt that he would not at-
tempt to manage the
foreign service. He wished
only to expound policy. He
served something like 11
years in the office.
Occasionally, a secreta-
ry of state installs a subor-
dinate to manage the de-
partment. But the
bureaucrats regard such a
reformer as some kind of
insect and, like the carni-
vorous plant Dionaea, en-
close the intruder and
smother out his life.

When the impatient
John F. Kennedy went
from the Senate to the
White House, he could not
conquer that bureaucracy.
And so he set up another
"ministry" of foreign af-
fairs in the White House,
with McGeorge Bundy at
its head. Schlesinger be-
longed to the new "minis-
try" and, according to his
story, egregious mistakes
were made by this cross-
ing of lines of authority.
How does the State De-
partment bureaucracy
operate? It lives by buck-
passing, by close cohesion
within the elite in which
one functionary protects
the others and in which
committees are formed
that waste their energies
in studies. Only occasion-
ally do horrible blunders
come to public attention,
and then outright lying or
double talk covers the ble-
mish.
In recent news we have
the perfect example.
In Singapore Prime Mi-
nister Lee Kuan Yew
charged that the CIA (it-
self an impenetrables
bureaucracy) had tried to
bribe him to cover up an
agent's effort to penetrate
Singapore's intelligence
service. At first the State
Department flatly denied
it. Later the prime minis-
ter disclosed a letter of
apology from Secretary
Rusk, and only then did
the State Department con-
firm Lee's story.
This sort of thing has
happened many times. It
happened in the U-2 case,
in 1960. It is coming to be
common practice to say
one thing one day and de-
ny it the next.
*
Nothing can serve to
provide the United States
with a foreign service ca-
pable of carrying the re-
sponsibility which America
has assumed in the world
until there is a wholesale
pruning out of the depart-
ment. There should be a
cut in personnel by 50%
and higher quality among
those who survive.
Rusk is the captive and
victim of a system. And
Schlesinger would have
been wiser and more help-
ful if he had stressed this,
rather than taking aim at
the hapless piano player.
