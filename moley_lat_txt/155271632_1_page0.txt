The Two Lyndon Johnsons Can Be
Seen Clearly in His Labor Stand
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is the Mr. John-
son who since his assump-
tion of the Presidency has
uttered innumerable pious
preachments about unity
and a "consensus" in
which all interests may
rest peacefully under his
beneficient shadow.
That Mr. Johnson lives
to be loved and hates to be
alone. Through the White
House portals, at his invi-
tation, there come the rich,
the poor, the employer,
the employee - everyone
who craves the delightful
experience of sitting down
and "reasoning together."
That Mr. Johnson
speaks of the idea of com-
mon consent in mellifluous
tones which have not been
heard from the White
House since the brief res-
idence of Warren G. Hard-
ing, "the great emollient."
The other Mr. Johnson
is thrusting down the
throat of a reluctant Con-
gress and also into 19
states the most divisive
measure that has come be-
fore Congress this year. It
is the repeal of Section
14(b) of the Taft-Hartley
Act, which has been the
law of the land for 18
years. But in the demand
for this repeal, the first
Mr. Johnson reappears,
saying that his proposal is
made "with the hope of re-
ducing conflicts in our na-
tional labor policy that for
years have divided Ameri-
cans in several states."

In 1947, when this same
Lyndon B. Johnson was a
congressman, he saw the
issue in a quite different
light. For he not only vot-
ed to pass the Taft-Hartley
bill but voted to pass it
over President Truman's
veto. Possibly when Pres-
ident Johnson visited the
former President recently
in Independence, Mo., the
two exchanged felicita-
tions over this change of
opinion.
How can the identities
of the two Mr. Johnsons
be reconciled?
In 1921, when Lyndon
B. Johnson was a school-
boy, a notable British psy-
chologist, Bernard Hart,
provided a definition of
the political mind which
explains how the two per-
sonalities can be combined
in the same man:
"When a party politi-
cian is called upon to con-
sider a new measure, his
verdict is largely deter-
mined by certain constant
systems of ideas and
trends of thought consti-
tuting what is generally
known in our newly
acquired terminology as
his 'political complex.'
"The complex comes to
him to take up an attitude
toward the proposed mea-
sure which is quite inde-
pendent of any absolute
merits which the latter
may possess... the indi-
vidual himself is probably
quite unaware of this me-
chanism in his mind.
"His thinking (is) deter-
mined by a complex of
whose action he is uncon-
cious, but that he believes
his thoughts to be the re-
sult of other causes which
are in reality insufficient
and illusory... (He) con-
ceals the real foundation of
his thought by series of
adventitious props."
If the President were to
present his real motivation
for the repeal of 14(b), he
would say that he is pay-
ing a political debt to the
union leaders who helped
to elect him. That we
could understand, and be-
ing human and lovers of
frankness we might, for-
give him. But, instead, the
other Mr. Johnson takes
over, and we are told that
he is seeking peace and
unity.
The cliche which we
have heard from George
Meany and others for
years is that the unions
want no bar to compulsory
unionism because they
want "union security."
That means they want to
be relieved of the hard
work of convincing work-
ers that the union can be
good for them.
In defending the pro-
posed repeal, Secretary
Wirtz confessed that there
is no reliable evidence that
the ban on compulsory
unionism in 19 states has
injured the unions or the
national economy.
*
In the close House vote,
221-203, on the repeal it
was clear that without
pressure from the Pres-
ident there would be no
chance whatsoever of get-
ting it enacted. The House
vote shows that opposition
to repeal is so strong as to
leave a bitter feeling in
more than a third of the
states and among employ-
ers generally.
This flatly denies the
claim of the President that
repeal is in the interest of
ending conflicts. For if it is
passed, it will greatly in-
crease litigation brought
by employers, who will
still demand their right to
employ workers, whether
they are members of
unions or not.
