Academic Embalmers of Notables'
Papers Should Show Responsibility
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There seems to be
sweeping through the
academic world, especially
in the history depart-
ments, a passion for col-
lecting and examining the
letters and other written
material of people who
had any part, even a min-
or one, in past public af-
fairs.
For a long time profes-
sors and professional his-
torians have regarded
these memorabilia as most
valuable basic material for
history writing, and to a
large extent they have
been right. But the hot
pursuit has been joined by
less mature people, candi-
dates for the M.A. and the
Ph.D. A professor told me
recently that even under-
graduates have been sent
packing to the Library of
Congress to get material
for term papers.

The pressure of college
administrators who regard
published articles or books
as more of a qualification
for appointment or promo-
tion than a capacity to
teach has accelerated the
hunt. For it is not so diffi-
cult, by using long quota-
tions from letters and such
sources, for the writer to
make a long article or a
thick book out of a rather
inconsequential incident.
And the popularity of this
sort of "research" has
caused college librarians
to solicit collected "pa-
pers" from all and sundry
who in any way have been
associated with past
events.
There is a financial ad-
vantage for donors of such
material because it can be
the basis of a considerable
income-tax deduction.
No doubt, this passion to
embalm the written mater-
ial of people who lived in
the past has been heated
up by the building of libra-
ries containing the papers
of various Presidents.
Since the Roosevelt libra-
ry was established at
Hyde Park, we have had
the libraries of Truman,
Eisenhower and Hoover,
and there will be a Kenne-
dy building at Harvard.
Surely there will rise more
stately repositories on the
banks of the Pedernales.
I see no objection to
these memorials, except
that the problem of travel-
ing from place to place is a
burden on the serious his-
torian. It would have been
better to have had all
these papers, which
for the most part are the
legitimate property of the
nation, in the Library of
Congress.
But unrestricted access
to the many collections of
papers of lesser figures
presents serious problems.
For not only the material
written by the people
directly concerned, but the
letters which others have
written to them are thus
embalmed for all time and
for all to see.
This suggests a warning
to anyone who writes to
a public figure. For in ma-
ny cases the public indivi-
dual concerned had little
Moley
or no opportunity to cull
out of his files the irrele-
vant and unfortunate
material before he died.
In one instance the "pa-
pers" of a distinguished
senator were boxed up
and sent to the Library of
Congress. Included in this
mass of stuff there ap-
peared an empty whisky
bottle. This item might be
pounced upon by the im-
mature, amateur historian
as a profoundly revealing
commentary on the time
and on the individual who
consumed it.
Great sums are forth-
coming from individuals
and foundations for this
collecting of "papers." A
lifetime of labor and a con-
siderable fortune were
given by W. S. Lewis to
the publication of more
than 30 volumes of the cor-
respondence, journals,
books and other material
left by Horace Walpole.
Walpole was the irre-
sponsible son of the fa-
mous, powerful and cor-
rupt Sir Robert Walpole,
who headed the British
government for a long
time in the 18th century.
One questions whether
this expenditure was
worthwhile. For all that
material is not a reflection
of the public or private life
of the time, but the impres-
sions of a not very reliable
witness who, as a review-
er of this work recently
said, "lived at the heart of
nothing important" in his
time.

Greater responsibility is
the answer to this present
craze for collecting and
writing about collecting.
The people who are in
charge of these collections
must exercise care in
granting access and, with-
in the limits of reason, cull
them out so that what is
available to writers is real-
ly vested with a public in-
terest rather than mere ir-
relevant private matters.
Quotations published in
articles and books should
require the checking and
approval of the people in
charge. For damaging
stuff may be quoted out of
context, and also the repu-
tations of individuals men-
tioned in the papers must
be protected.
Generally, I would sug-
gest that in the writing of
history there should be
more thinking and reflec-
tion and somewhat less
collecting and copying.
