Morrissey Defeat May Upgrade
the Selection of Federal Judges
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Now that Francis X.
Morrissey has been re-
turned with regrets by the
Senate to his makers, the
Kennedys, for whatever
reward they choose to give
him for loyal personal ser-
vices, there is a moment to
reflect upon the damage
that modern political prac-
tices have done to the fe-
deral judiciary.
The Kennedys are said
to be readers of history,
especially those portions of
history in which the Ken-
nedy name appears as a
footnote. Their reading in
recent years must have
moved them to believe
that almost anyone could
be elevated to any high of-
fice if enough political
skill and audacity were
employed in the process.
â˜…
It is a rather remarkable
coincidence that the defeat
of the Morrissey confirma-
tion was not only a service
to the federal judiciary
and the United States, a
lift to the good name of the
Senate and a fortunate
break for President John-
son, but in its consequen-
ces most fortunate for the
Kennedys as well.
If by mutual back-
scratching and log-rolling
Edward Kennedy had se-
cured enough votes to con-
firm his family's protege,
the presence of Morrissey
on the bench in a federal
court would have been a
lasting reproach to the
people who put him there.
He would always have
been regarded as the Ken-
nedys' judge, serving not
in his own right but be-
cause of the people who
had promoted him.
The story of how politics
seasons justice goes back
to the early days of the Re-
public. But its modern and
more deplorable manifes-
tation first appeared in
1937 when President Roos-
evelt sought to pack the
Supreme Court. That ef-
fort, even though it was
made by a President at the
very peak of his populari-
ty, resulted in such an out-
burst of public indignation
that after a desperate
struggle in the Senate
from February to July the
Roosevelt bill, like the
Morrissey nomination,
was recommitted and
killed.
But, as was said later,
Roosevelt lost the battle
but won the war. Begin-
ning with the appointment
of Hugo Black in 1937, he
filled eight vacancies on
the Supreme Court during
his Presidency.
All these appointees
were Democrats. All ex-
cept James F. Byrnes,
whose appointment was
largely a concession to the
Senate, were ideologically
sympathetic with Roose-
velt's policies.
Only two had enjoyed
any considerable exper-
ience at the bar. And only
two, Black and Murphy,
had any judicial exper-
ience, and that was in low-
er courts with mostly min-
or criminal jurisdiction.
Three were former profes-
sors without judicial ex-
perience and little exper-
ience in trying cases.
During the Roosevelt
period the many appoint-
ments to the lower federal
courts followed the same
pattern. Almost all were
Democrats. Some appoint-
ments were given as a
means of livelihood to for-
mer members of Congress,
and some people were ap-
pointed to get them out of
administrative jobs in
which they had not suc-
ceeded.
President Truman made
four appointments to the
Supreme Court. Three of
his appointees had no judi-
cial experience, and the
other's service on a lower
federal bench was very
short. Three were Demo-
crats, and one was a Re-
publican senator. The Tru-
man appointments to the
lower federal courts were
mostly partisan appoint-
ments controlled by Demo-
cratic senators.
The political imbalance
was measurably corrected
in the Eisenhower years,
when the President ap-
pointed 76 Republicans
and 11 Democrats.
Seventy-three new
judgeships were created
by Congress late in the
1950s, but the Senate re-
fused to confirm President
Eisenhower's selections.
These vacancies, along
with others, were filled by
President Kennedy. He
named 88 Democrats and
eight Republicans. One
may be sure that Robert
Kennedy selected most of
them with specific politi-
cal purposes in mind.
Under the Johnson re-
gime there have been 50
appointments. All but
three were Democrats.
Because of the furore oc-
casioned by the Morrissey
nomination, possibly the
President as well as the
senators concerned will
exercise more care in the
selections from now on.
For a deterioration of the
quality of these courts
brought about by political
tests in the selection of
judges will not only lower
the standards of justice,
but tend to destroy the
constitutional indepen-
dence of the judiciary as a
whole.
