Vermont Republicans Buckle Down
to Recover Ground Lost in 1964
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A very significant politi-
cal event seems to have
been lost in recent news.
Perhaps that is because
people believed that for
Vermont to go Republican
was not news at all. But a
close look at what hap-
pened in the Green Moun-
tain State on Nov. 23
shows a clear hint of what
may happen in many oth-
er states in November,
1966.
In 1964 Vermont, like
many other Republican
states, witnessed a sensa-
tional political upset. A
Democrat running for the
second time was elected
governor, the first Demo-
crat to occupy that office
in 140 years. Phillip Hoff,
or rather L.B.J., carried
with him the entire state-
wide ticket and a goodly
part of the legislature.
But a reapportionment
of the legislature called for
a new election of members
this November.
Under the old apportion-
ment, the lower house had
246 members, the Sen-
ate 30. Reapportionment
called for 150 and 30 re-
spectively. In 1964 greatly
reduced Republican ma-
jorities were elected to the
two houses. In this elec-
tion, the Republicans won
24 of the 30 Senate seats
and 115 of the 150 House
seats. In some of the more
industrialized centers the
Democrats did fairly well.
But the vote in the coun-
try was overwhelmingly
Republican.
The shock of their de-
feat in 1964 made Republi-
cans realize that they had
taken things for granted
too long. Their state orga-
nization was passive, inert
and moss-grown. In defeat
Republicans
bestirred
themselves and brought
many new and vigorous
younger people into poli-
tics. Attractive candidates
were chosen, and the new
state chairman, Derick
Vanderbilt Webb, took
charge.
This certainly was not a
turn to the Javits-Lindsay
brand of liberal Republica-
nism, for the issues were
measurably conservative.
One was government econ-
omy, but tempered by a
recognition that many new
services were there to
stay. Another was opposi-
tion to a plan to centralize
schools and weaken local
control. National issues
were not prominent in
Vermont this year.
An analysis of the 1964
defeat there showed that
there was not only the fear
which eastern Republi-
cans had implanted
against Goldwater in the
primaries, but a change in
population and industrial
life. Some of the larger ur-
ban centers had acquired
new industry and, with
that, an influx of union la-
bor.
This strengthened the
Democrats considerably.
Farming in Vermont for a
long time has turned from
tilling the soil to the milk
and dairy business. Also, a
considerable number of
new residents have moved
into southern Vermont, at-
tracted by the new high-
ways and beautiful natur-
al advantages.
But this challenge was
met by a reorganized Re-
Moley
publican Party. Its cam-
paign this year was smart-
ly managed. This made it
possible for thousands of
traditional Republicans to
return to the faith of their
fathers.
The result was a sweep
of major proportions. This
was revealed not only in
the proportion of legisla-
tive seats captured, but in
most impressive majori-
ties. A friend of mine in
Montpelier, where I re-
cently spent two summers,
entered politics for the
first time and won his seat
in the House by a vote of
668 to 187.
The Republicans now
are setting their sights on
winning back the gover-
norship and other state-
wide offices in 1066.
There are a number of
lessons in this Vermont
Republican victory which
have a bearing on the con-
tests in 1966, especially
those which concern the
U.S. House of Representa-
tives.
One lesson is that elec-
tions at the local level are
not won by national issues
alone. More important are
attractive candidates and
vigorous organizations.
Presidents are elected on
national issues, but district
elections involve many
other things. A most
powerful influence is the
traditional party affiliation
of voters.
Moreover, in the 1964
election 48 Democrats de-
feated incumbent Republi-
cans, often by squeaky ma-
jorities of a few hundred.
Many of these beneficia-
ries of a strong national
tide won not because of
personal attractiveness.
They were the items
washed ashore in a storm.
And many are oddballs
who were practically un-
known before they ran.
Since they are freshman
members, they have had
no chance to impress
themselves upon their con-
stituencies. Their defeated
Republican opponents are
now back there at home,
working for a return. And
voting habits are not
changed by a single act of
apostacy. In Vermont, Re-
publicans turned back to
their old allegiance and,
with the help of better or-
ganization, Republican
candidates won. It may
happen in many of the 48
lost districts next year.
