Politics and Power; or, How to
Succeed by Trying Everything
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
People in public life are
teachers as well as doers
or do-nothings. Those big
shots you read about have
a classroom so big and
voices so loud that they
drown out the copy-book
maxims of fairness and
morality that youngsters
hear in the schools.
Let us consider the many
thousands of boys of high-
school age in New York Ci-
ty, every one of whom wit-
nessed what happened in
the recent deplorable con-
troversy with the Transit
Workers Union and
learned from it more than
they got from their ne-
glected books.
The top teachers were
Prof. Michael Quill, TWU,
and his associate and as-
sistant professors em-
ployed by the union and
with the same TWU de-
gree. The course was
"How to Get What you
Want in Life."
*
This is what was taught:
Hitch your wagon to a
schedule of outlandish and
unreasonable demands.
Threaten to quit and de-
monstrate even before
your earlier promises have
been fulfilled. Reject what
is offered in a new agree-
ment. Go on the platform,
and in the press and on ra-
dio and television call the
people in nominal authori-
ty nasty names.
Never mind the law.
Tear up court orders. Ig-
nore the peace, comfort
and rights of bystanders.
For the more you hurt
those people, the quicker
you will win the ar-
gument. Their suffering is
your gain.
Never mind what your
lawless actions cost people
who have nothing to do
with the argument. If you
have enough power, you
will get what you want.
Then, since so many of
you young men will want
to go into politics because
your mother said when
you were in your cradle
that you might be Pres-
ident someday, learn
something from those who
have gone high in political
life. Here the professors
are more subtle, but quite
as calculating as Prof.
Quill, et al.
Do you want to be may-
or of New York, with all
the prerequisites of that
office and all the cheering
and public acclaim that go
with the job? Consider the
teachings of Prof. Robert
F. Wagner.
For 12 years he operat-
ed in happy coexistence
with Quill. When contract
time came, there was a
routine of shouting and
fact-finding and figuring,
but always peace was
bought by more moneyâ€”
much of which the city
didn't have.

Want to run for mayor
and win after riding
through the swanks and
slums on the white horse
of reform? With the speed
of the white knight on the
white horse in the televi-
sion commercial, toss on
all sides as many promises
as come to mind. But,
above all, promise the pop-
ulace the 15-cent fare.
Want to be re-elected
governor of New York?
Slip the Republican mayor
the word that you will
save his rash promise to
keep the 15-cent fare by
tossing him $100 million.
Then, as your mother
predicted when you were
a baby, you become the
President of these United
States. In that office you
are the biggest professor
of politics of all. Since you
won the union vote when
you ran for office, you can-
not offend by saying any-
thing about the outrageous
demands of Quill. That
might bother Meany and
Reuther.
You permit the Republi-
can mayor to suffer
through the hostilities. Af-
ter all, he asked for the job
and defeated a Democrat
in the election. But after
the thing has been settled,
whack the mayor for
breaking the "guidelines"
and paying more to the
workers and thus setting
off a tide of inflation.
*
But don't blame Quill
and the TWU for exacting
these riches. Also, ask for
repeal of Section 14-B and
thus add to the power of
all unions to paralyze the
people.
Perhaps the lesson
taught by these union
leaders and politicians can
he summed up in this way:
Success in life is an exer-
cise in the use of power.
Politics is the art of make-
believe.
