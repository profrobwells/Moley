Some of the New York Election's
Lessons Don't Fit Usual Pattern
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are few lessons to
be drawn from the elec-
tion of John V. Lindsay as
mayor which do not fit the
historical pattern of New
York City politics. In the
past, the tide of opinion
has risen against a Demo-
cratic administration in
the city after somewhere
between 10 and 20 years of
misgovernment.
The change was longer
in coming this time be-
cause there had been no
flaming scandals in Mayor
Wagner's regime and also
because in the early 1950s
the city had, for a while, a
somewhat better Democra-
tic mayor. But the accu-
mulation of bad and indif-
ferent administrations fi-
nally made itself felt, and
voters called for a change,
at least in the office of
mayor.

As has been the pattern
in the past, the man who
won, although a nominal
Republican, needed a great
deal of help from other
parties, factions and min-
ority groups. And, as has
been the case in other mu-
nicipal elections, the en-
dorsement of his opponent
by the President of the
United States had a nega-
tive effect. When La Guar-
dia first ran, in 1933, Mr.
Roosevelt privately fa-
vored him, but he was
too smart to give him a
public endorsement. City
dwellers resent interfer-
ence from Washington in
their election.
In this campaign, the
word Republican was a
term of reproach. The
mainstream of the Repub-
lican Party — for which
Gov. Rockefeller pleaded
so piteously in 1964 when
he was seeking the Pres-
idential nomination—end-
ed this year in New York
City in a muddy and direc-
tionless delta. The many
candidates extolled many
things, but no one had a
good word for the poor old
GOP. Indeed, in the un-
seemly scuffle which pre-
ceded the election, to call a
man a Republican almost
justified a suit for slander.
When the Hon. James
Roosevelt was running for
governor of California in
1950, he said that, while he
wanted to avoid a dirty
campaign, he intended to
prove that his opponent,
Earl Warren, was a Re-
publican. This time in
New York, Abraham
Beame, the Democratic
candidate, said much the
same thing about Lindsay.
The latter, who first
won his seat in Congress
as a Republican with the
help of loyal Republican
workers, scarcely men-
tioned the word "Republi-
can." And William F.
Buckley, running as a can-
didate on the Conservative
Party, said that he was
trying to save the two-par-
ty system by making sure
that no Republican could
win. That misfired, how-
ever, because it became
apparent in the final days
of the campaign that a
majority of his votes were
to come from unhappy
Democrats.
★
Lindsay in the final
week of the campaign
charged that Buckley was
the Goldwater-chosen can-
didate and that his cam-
paign was being directed
from Arizona. I know
more about that than
Lindsay, and what I know
proves Lindsay's charge to
be untrue.
Barry Goldwater had
nothing to do with the
Conservative Party in
New York or with its can-
didate. For the former
Presidential candidate is a
loyal Republican, and
when he has been in a po-
sition to do so he has sup-
ported all Republicans of
every shade of opinion.
That applied to his actions
in 1962 when he supported
Javits in New York and
Kuchel in California.
Buckley said a good ma-
ny things that greatly
needed saying in his vigor-
ous campaign, but his poli-
tical formula is not likely
to provide our states and
cities with better govern-
ment or promote the cause
of responsible party
government.

What seems to have
been missed in the com-
ments on this election is
that the people who have
to work and live in New
York City were not facing
a party or ideological
choice, but a matter of mu-
nicipal housekeeping.
Good administration of
the many activities of a ci-
ty is not as interesting as
ideological speculation or
the projection of party
trends. But it is vital to the
people who every day face
badly managed traffic, dir-
ty streets, lawlessness and,
in this instance, a shortage
of water because of sloppy
management.
That in my judgment is
what turned the voters to
Lindsay. For a change in
the city hall meant a
group of better commis-
sioners and, for a time,
measurable improvement.
The voters would have ac-
cepted a socialist if he had
offered that promise.
