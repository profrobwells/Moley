Foundation in Role of Government
Critic Might Face a Taxation Jolt
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
With the release of the
Ford Foundation's annual
report, Henry T. Heald
ends his presidency of that
mammoth institution. He
has served 10 years and is
to be succeeded by Mc-
George Bundy. In Heald's
report he describes the
principles which have
guided him in shaping the
policies of the foundation.
The 1965 income of the
foundation was $145 mil-
lion, but it spent an addi-
tional $200 million of prin-
cipal. The assets from
which this income was de-
rived are listed at $3 bil-
lion. That is the largest, by
all odds, of any such insti-
tution anywhere in the
world, so far as I know.
Unlike many of the
thousands of foundations
now in existence, the Ford
Foundation has little limi-
tation in the purposes for
which its money shall be
spent. All it needs to do is
to keep within the legal li-
mits imposed by law and
specified by the U.S. Inter-
nal Revenue Service. The
law mentions "charitable"
purposes, but that expres-
sion, like charity itself,
covers a multitude of
things.

It is interesting to note
that while the great-grand-
father of American foun-
dations, the one founded
by John D. Rockefeller in
1913, fairly definitely li-
mited its interests to
health, medicine and me-
dical education, the Ford
Foundation since the ac-
cession of Heald to the
presidency has largely
abandoned that field.
Its place has been taken
by something called "the
humanities and the arts,"
but the major area in
which most of the income
is spent is dedicated to
"educational resources,
college and university
development and interna-
tional training and re-
search."
Heald's observations on
the relations between the
foundation and the im-
mense recent intrusion of
the federal government in-
to education and welfare
as they relate to such phi-
lanthropic institutions as
Ford occupy much of his
report.
In general he says that
government aid is best li-
mited to the wholesale
support of activities for
which the guidelines have
already been laid down.
For ours is a government
of politicians and bureau-
crats, not of philosophers
and innovators. In the na-
ture of things government
cannot afford experimen-
tation. Taxpayers and vo-
ters require something
they can understand.

Therefore, a foundation
must assume the risks of
finding and trying out
new methods and new de-
vices in all fields, especial-
ly in education. For it is
not subject to the blaze of
press and political criti-
cism to which government
is exposed. It can afford to
try things which prove to
be useless and wasteful. A
foundation's money is as a
predecessor of Heald once
said, the "risk capital" of
social progress.
On one point made by
Heald, I have some reser-
vations. He says:
"(The foundations) can
serve a major function in
assisting evaluation, re-
search and monitoring of
government efforts. Many
public officials themselves
agree that the government
is not the best judge of its
own performance. Ulti-
mately, of course, the elec-
torate passes judgment,
but the painstaking job of
investigation and analysis
can be done only by the
scholar and his institu-
tions."
I wonder how far a
foundation can go in serv-
ing as a critic of govern-
ment activities. Such scru-
tiny, when publicized, is
likely to be termed by the
U.S. Internal Revenue
Service as "political" and
by law foundations are
prohibited from political
activity.
Suppose, for example, a
foundation should poke in-
to the mess that is the
President's war on pover-
ty. I should imagine that
the IRS sleuths would im-
mediately pounce down
upon such a bit of "moni-
toring." It may be that, as
Heald says, "many public
officials themselves agree
that the government is not
the best judge of its own
performance."
★
But in my own small
field as a critic of govern-
mental affairs, I have nev-
er met any such modest of-
ficials. Their life in office
depends upon justifying
their own performance.
I believe that Heald in
the paragraph quoted
above is voicing a hope
rather than a reality. The
function of criticism, de-
spite these noble
sentiments of Heald, must re-
main limited to the press,
the opposition political
party, the committees of
Congress and the comp-
troller general of the Unit-
ed States.
