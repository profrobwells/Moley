In Reality, the 'Fed' Pulled the
Fiscal Chestnuts Out of the Fire
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is nothing a politi-
cian hates so much as
making an unpopular deci-
sion. And when an accom-
plished politician holds the
high office of President of
the United States and fa-
ces an unpopular choice of
policies, he will at first
stall and squirm and pray
that the reasons for any
decision will vanish.
If the necessity to decide
does not go away and
someone else makes the
decision, he will put on an
act of stamping and
protesting. But in his
heart there is that warm
sense of gratitude which
passeth all understanding.
That is a quite plausible
explanation of what hap-
pened recently when infla-
tion began to shake its go-
ry locks at the spending
programs of the Johnson
regime and Chairman
Martin and three of his
colleagues on the Federal
Reserve Board raised the
discount rate.
Martin has for months
been unhappy about the
President's easy - money
policies. Last spring he is-
sued a clear warning that
excessive credit was one of
the "disquieting similari-
ties" between the current
fiscal scene and that
which prevailed before the
stock market crash in
1929.

His warning seemed to
have had no impact upon
the Presidential mind, and
Mr. Johnson gaily went on
with plans to propose in
1966 bigger and more ex-
pensive domestic spending
programs. And so Martin
and three of his colleagues
decided to act. After all,
the Federal Reserve
Board is supposed to po-
lice the credit system, and
since it is an independent
agency it could afford to
awaken the nation from its
happy dreams of more for
everyone and everything.
Thereupon, the Pres-
ident expressed unhappy
concern. He said that the
board should have waited
until his budget figures
were placed on display in
January. But that objec-
tion was so flimsy that
anyone could see through
it even with failing eye-
sight. Finally, the Pres-
ident resigned himself by
saying that, after all, the
"Fed" is an independent
agency and he couldn't do
anything about what it
had decided to do.
Then, because the ac-
tion of the Federal Re-
serve Board had made
things easier to strike a
note for economy, Mr.
Johnson summoned his
budget director to Texas to
talk about the budget and
sent that poor man back to
Washington under orders
to tote up all the figures
again and make some im-
portant cuts in the domes-
tic programs.
It has been my business
for a considerable number
of years to observe and try
to understand Presidential
behavior and also to try to
penetrate to the depths of
the political mind. It is my
considered opinion that
the foregoing is an exact
explanation of what has
happened in this instance.
It had been inevitable
that screams would arise
from the dedicated ex-
ponents of easy money,
high spending, bigger defi-
cits and inflation and that
their indignation would
center upon the Federal
Reserve Board, as it has so
many times in the past.
The Hon. Wright Patman,
the Populistic heir of Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, in-
tends to "investigate" the
Federal Reserve Board.
This sort of thing has also
happened many times in
the past. Indeed, the Fe-
deral Reserve system was
created in 1913 in the face
of violent protests by the
immortal "Peerless Lead-
er," then secretary of state
under Woodrow Wilson.
But it is my conclusion
that L. B. J. doesn't really
want to bring the Federal
Reserve Board under the
control of the Treasury
and the President. If he is
as smart as I think he is,
he will not do what so
many have predicted and
"pack" the board against
Martin by appointing a
new member in January
who would swing the
board toward an easy-mo-
ney course and thus make
the board subservient to
the political administra-
tion now in power.
Such an unwise action
by Mr. Johnson would
place the baby smack in
the lap of the administra-
tion. If inflation should get
out of hand, there would
then be no one for the un-
happy victims of inflation
to blame but the Pres-
ident.
My opinion is that, de-
spite Presidential protests
and the shouting of Vice
President Humphrey, the
administration doesn't
want the Federal Reserve
Board to be anything but
independent. It is the poli-
tician's buffer when un-
happy decisions have to be
made.
