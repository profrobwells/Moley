Time Seems Here for an Intense
War Effort in South Vietnam
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On Dec. 9, when the
great peace offensive start-
ed, President Johnson
said:
"Unchecked aggression
against free and helpless
people would be a grave
threat to our own freedom
-an offense to our own
conscience
We are
equally determined that
every prospect for peace
shall be exhausted before
other hard steps are ta-
ken."
That is a very clear
statement of the Johnson
policy in Southeast Asia
and the Western Pacific.
Put in the form of the
"whereases" and "be it re-
solveds" of a resolution by
a legislative or other body,
it goes like this:
Whereas we have a le-
gal and moral right to
make secure the freedom
of South Vietnam; and
*
Whereas, the loss of
South Vietnam to commu-
nism would certainly be
followed by the loss of all
the other free countries in
Southeast Asia and the ul-
timate necessity of fight-
ing a greater war to save
the Philippines, sea com-
munications in the Pacific
and to prevent at the least
the neutralization of Ja-
pan; and
Whereas, unless we
should succeed in this wi-
der, more costly and inevi-
table war, our perimeter
of defense and our nation-
al interest would be rolled
back to Hawaii, western
Latin America and our
own seacoast in the Paci-
fic;
Therefore, be it resolved
that there should be an im-
mediate appeal to all Com-
munist nations to use their
power to end the aggres-
sion in Vietnam and also
an effort to make clear to
all the other nations of the
free world what our pur-
poses and intentions are;
and
*
Therefore, if these ef-
forts to end the war by ne-
gotiations which do not
imperil our position in
Vietnam should fail;
We shall take whatever
"hard steps" are necessary
to end the aggression by
military force.
Now the peace offensive
has been completed and
has failed. The returns are
in, and they are negative.
Ambassador Arthur Gold-
berg, after his return from
his missions, has said:
"There has been great con-
cern whether we are real-
ly pursuing what has been
said is a path to peace."
Now the major decision
which must be made by
the President is whether
we shall take the "hard
steps."
This cannot mean a con-
tinuation or even an inten-
sified form of jungle fight-
ing in South Vietnam.
That would mean years of
indecisive warfare, with
steady attrition in Ameri-
can lives.
*
Nor can it mean the mere
token bombardment of se-
lected spots in North Viet-
nam. Until the stopping of
bombing, our Air Force
was not permitted by our
diplomacy to attack the
really vital spots in North
Vietnam. Our investment
in planes and men has not
been worth the targets
struck-parts of a bridge
here and there, ammuni-
tion dumps, unimportant
spots where supplies are
landed from the sea, small
hits at supply loads to the
South. The real centers of
Communist power and the
industries of North Viet-
nam have been designated
as sanctuaries by the di-
plomats in Washington.
Meanwhile we have
gathered a vast potential
-Air Force, Army and
Navy-in positions from
which an effective war
could be launched. We
have already put so much
potential into the area that
a retreat would mean a
tragic blow to our position
all over the world.
The Air Force is con-
vinced that the Commu-
nist potential--particular-
ly its railroad links-could
be smashed in a matter of
days. If this should be
done and the Navy should
be used to blockade the
landing of further sup-
plies, the war could be
won.
President Johnson must
know now what he proba-
bly knew as a senator in
1951, that if Gen. MacArth-
ur had been permitted by
the State Department and
the President to attack
North Korea, we might
never have been em-
broiled in Vietnam. For
the Chinese government
and the Soviets would
have learned the only les-
son they are capable of un-
derstanding-the meaning
of force and the determin-
ation of the United States
to use it.
*
The spread of the war in
China and Russia is al-
ways a risk. The risk
would be infinitely greater
if we withdrew after a
phony neutralization of
Vietnam to the Philip-
pines, Formosa and the
Pacific islands.
An intensified war in
Vietnam would unify this
country behind the Pres-
ident. It is time to permit
military considerations to
prevail and to take this
war out of the hands of the
soft-headed demonstrators
in our own country and
the statesmen who cry
peace when there is no
peace.
