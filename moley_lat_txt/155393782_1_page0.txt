The British Election Is
an Exercise in Dullness
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For the first time since 1950 this
writer feels no urge to cross the
ocean and witness a British cam-
paign and election. For all the infor-
mation provided in the British press
and the manifestos of the Labor and
Conservative parties make clear that
this is the most listless and unimpor-
tant campaign since the days of
Baldwin and Chamberlain before
the war.
In the years since World War II
and until now there were lofty and
provoking leadersâ€”Churchill,
Aneurin Bevan, Attlee, Gaitskell,
even Macmillan. Now the cast is me-
diocre and the script is dull.
The polls, which the British great-
ly overestimate, say that Labor will
win a large majority in the House of
Commons. But British polls have
proved to be grossly inaccurate in
past elections, and Americans are
not likely to take them seriously. La-
bor, however, may win a larger ma-
jority than in 1964 largely because
the British voter believes that "poor
old Wilson" ought to have more time
to prove himself.
Under normal circumstances a
ruling party is kept in power. And
things are very "normal" this year.
"Normal" over there means a chron-
ic discomfort and dissatisfaction
that have prevailed ever since Brit-
ain faded as a great power. With
only a few colonies left, and with
France and Germany flourishing,
the British must settle for short ra-
tions in world trade.
The success of Harold Wilson af-
ter he followed Hugh Gaitskell as
leader of the Labor Party has been
due to his skill in exploiting Tory
mistakes and in expropriating Con-
servative policies as his own. Now
the Conservatives cannot gain much
by damning socialism because
Marxism has been abandoned and
Wilson has even refrained from pur-
suing new adventures in nationaliz-
ing industry.

The large American industrial en-
terprises in the United Kingdom are
too important to British workers to
risk their displeasure. In his last
days Gaitskell told the members of
his party that they must not live
apart from the bourgeois middle
class. One member in Wilson's
government declared that he sent
his son to Eton so that he might asso-
ciate with his "social peers." The
Exchequer frames its policies to con-
form to the banking community. In
short, Labor has decided that eco-
nomic survival is too important to
risk by new social reforms.
One American correspondent has
written seriously that the British
government under Wilson is "less
socialistic than France under
Charles de Gaulle."
In order to shore up sterling, Wil-
son has had no option except to bor-
row from abroad. The United States
cannot afford the risk to itself of re-
fusing fiscal and military help to
Britain. And so, by a curious re-
versal of policy, Labor has been less
anti-American than the Conserva-
tives.
There is little that is new in the
election manifestos of the two par-
ties. In the past, Labor's manifestos
have at least had a literary quality
since so much of the writing was
done by "intellectuals" who came
from the universities.
The Conservative manifesto is
routine.
There is little choice in the es-
sence of what the two parties are
offering. That, and the general belief
that nothing much can be done by
any government to improve Brit-
ain's status in the world, means a
relatively light vote and a heavy
weight of public apathy.
In a report published in The New
Leader, Ronald Steel writing from
London has fairly well summed up
the position of Wilson as his party
goes to the polls:
"...it seems increasingly clear
that he (Wilson) pursues the policies
he does because he believes that Brit-
ain's role as a world power lies in

close association with the United
States. If playing a world role means
Britain shall be an auxiliary to
Washington, then an auxiliary she
shall be.
"So long as nobody minds, so long
as the Vietnamese war does not es-
calate into a war with China, so long
as Britain can ride America's coat-
tails and still not have to give up
anything more than her political
freedom of maneuver, so long as the
threatened recession can be kept at
bay and so long as the nation con-
tinues to enjoy the stylish decadence
that is one of the great charms of
Britain today, Harold Wilson is like-
ly to stay on at Ten Downing Street.
He will stay on not because he is
loved and not because his policies
have been very successful, but rath-
er, in the words of the Economist,
'because he has outworked all the
others."
