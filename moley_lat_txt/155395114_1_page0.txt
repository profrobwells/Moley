We Should Cut Seaborn
Traffic to North Vietnam
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a telegram to President John-
son the Maritime Trades Depart-
ment of the AFL-CIO announced
that the martime unions would soon
begin a boycott of ships under flags
of countries whose vessels trade
with North Vietnam. This is not the
first time the maritime unions have
sought to preempt control over our
foreign policy.
In the present instance they are
expressing their contempt for the
emptiness of the gesture in the Mari-
time Administration's announce-
ment that ships trading with North
Vietnam would not be permitted to
carry foreign-aid cargoes from the
United States.
For more than a year, members of
the House of Representatives have
been protesting against free-world
traffic with North Vietnam. In Fe-
bruary of last year Rep. Paul G. Ro-
gers specifically listed the ships of
the free world entering North Viet-
nam and the ports from which they
had sailed. He has repeatedly sought
restriction on this traffic.
On Feb. 7 Rep. Charles E. Cham-
berlain in the course of a long
speech listed by name, nationality
and tonnage the free-world ships
which called at North Vietnam in
1965. There were 119 arrivals, of
which 67 were under the British
flag.
The Japanese ships which had
been listed by Congressman Rogers
and which had been quite active in
the trade have been restrained by
their government following protests
from Washington. Liberia and Le-
banon have prohibited ships under
their flags from calling at North
Vietnam.
A law is pending in the Greek par-
liament to forbid all ships under the
Greek flag to enter North Vietnam.
There have been no Norwegian
ships there since the middle of
November, when the second of two
vessels left the trade.
British sources have claimed that
their government is powerless to
stop the trade-mainly under Hong
Kong owners-because the ships are
chartered to the Communists. In re-
sponse to this, congressmen point
out that since the United States is
supporting the British in its quaran-
tine of Rhodesia, we have a right to
demand reciprocal action in our ef-
forts to stop aggression in Vietnam.
Secretary Dean Rusk and the
State Department have offered a
number of rather flimsy statements.
They say that the traffic was less in
1965 than it had been earlier. It is
true, as Congressman Rogers has
pointed out, that the number of arri-
vals of free-world vessels has fallen
-from 32 in the first six weeks of
1965 to eight in the comparable per-
iod this year. But that is eight too
many. Moreover, the unclassified in-
formation available is considered to
be understated.
It is very clear, however, that le-
thal supplies are reacing North Viet-
nam by sea. Late models of Soviet
MIGs are there, and they could not
have flown in or have come by land.
They were discovered in crates. Ar-
tillery, anti-aircraft guns and other
material have come by sea.
The issue comes down to the use
of our powerful Navy to cut North
Vietnam's supply by blockading its
ports. For the reduction of free-
world shipping does not mean that
fewer cargoes are reaching North
Vietnam.
In the past few years the Soviet
Union has been building its sea pow-
er at a spectacular rate, a develop-
ment largely overlooked here be-
cause of the more obvious sensation
of the moon race.
There seems to be a singular lack
of understanding about the sort of
blockade that might be applied. Un-
der international law it is not neces-
sary that war be declared before a
blockade is imposed.
Through the 19th century and in-
to the 20th the British, French, Rus-
sians and Germans used what is
called a pacific blockade in situa-
tions which were short of a declared
war. President Kennedy resorted to
pacific blockade in the missile crisis
in 1962, although he used the word
"quarantine" to describe it.
Such a blockade need not sink
ships or destroy cargoes. The United
States would simply declare such a
blockade and warn all the nations
concerned. It would list what it con-
siders to be contraband.
The Navy would make sure that
ships are stopped before they enter
North Vietnamese ports. The Navy's
Operation Market Time has progres-
sively restricted infiltration by sea
into South Vietnam. We have been
curiously tender toward Communist
shipping in the North.
