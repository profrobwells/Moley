Our Professed and Our
Real Mission in Vietnam
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has been a characteristic of
American foreign policy that in eve-
ry war in which we have been, espe-
cially since 1898, our real objective
has been masked by professions of
idealism and morality. Perhaps this
has been because wars are pro-
claimed by politicians, and politi-
cians must of necessity align them-
selves, verbally, with the simple
moral virtues.
When Woodrow Wilson aligned
the United States with the "associat-
ed" nations against Germany, the
slogan was "democracy against au-
tocracy." The real reason for our in-
volvement, expressed by more can-
did hawks of that time, was our na-
tional interest. We could not be safe
if Britain and France were over-
whelmed by the Central Empires of
Germany and Austro-Hungary.
Substantially the same confusion
of aims prevailed when President
Roosevelt dropped even the pre-
tense of neutrality in 1941.
We said we were bound in honor
to protect the independence of Ko-
rea in 1950. But realists know that
we used armed force in that corner
of Asia to protect Japan, the Philip-
pines and our Pacific interests from
Communist imperialism.

Before we consider our real mis-
sion in Vietnam, it may be well to
consider the factors which pushed
us into war with Spain in 1898.
For many years American expan-
slonists with eager anticipation had
eyed the prospect of driving Spain
out of Cuba. It was our "manifest
destiny" to extend our sovereignty
by acquiring outposts beyond the
continental United States to shore
up our security. President McKinley
used the expression when his admi-
nistration annexed the Hawaiian Is-
lands.
McKinley on taking office in 1897
inherited our concern about the
bloody rebellion in Cuba against the
Spanish rulers of that island. Ameri-
cans were morally shocked by the
brutality that attended the Cuban re-
volt. The pressure of public opinion
was reflected in Congress. But for a
time the peace-loving McKinley
sought to pacify Cuba by diplomatic
maneuvers with Spain.

In the decade of the 1890s, howev-
er, a strong new element favorable
to armed intervention appeared in
Washington. In 1890 there was pub-
lished Alfred Thayer Mahan's great
and influential book, "The Influence
of Sea Power on History."
The implications of Mahan's mes-
sage were quickly recognized by far-
sighted naval officers and by sena-
tors who were "Navy minded."
Those implications were that the na-
tion that dominated the great sea
lanes of the world not only could
determine international destiny but
maintain freedom of the seas by its
power.
Britain then enjoyed that distinc-
tion, but far-sighted Americans en-
visioned the time when the United
States must take over that responsi-
bility. Theodore Roosevelt became
assistant secretary of the Navy in
1897 and quickly caught the infec-
tion. His close friends and collabora-
tors in the Senate were Lodge, Frye,
Foraker, Chandler and Cushman
Davis.
T.R. accepted with vigor the
ideas of Mahan, with whom he main-
tained constant contact. He not only
labored with great foresight for an
enlarged Navy but recognized the
immense value of an isthmian canal
to link the oceans. Essential to that
plan was the elimination of Spain
from the Caribbean.
*
Amid all the forces, humanitarian
and otherwise, which brought about
the war with Spain, this new con-
cept of American destiny was a
powerful factor. As matters turned
out, Spain was eliminated from the
Caribbean, and far away in the Paci-
fic the Navy made possible the ac-
quisition of the Philippines. The aim
there was to prevent Germany from
acquiring those islands, perhaps by
purchase from Spain, which could
no longer defend them.
All this was a prelude to Vietnam.
Maritime strategy, so vigorously ex-
ploited by T.R., dictates that the
U.S. Navy, together with the Air
Force must of necessity keep the
avenues clear to Australia and In-
dia. A Communist takeover in South-
east Asia would threaten that ac-
cess. And the "manifest destiny"
of the United States is to hold the
lifelines against communism in any
form.
*
And so, while there has been
much talk by three Presidents that
we have a moral obligation to assure
the independence of South Vietnam,
the real reason for our commitment
is to assure passage by sea for the
free world, which includes Austra-
lia, India, the Philippines and Japan
as well as ourselves.
If it happens that the moral obliga-
tion to Vietnam is eliminated by the
course of civil war there, it still re-
mains our responsibility to keep a
foothold in Southeast Asia. The
Strait of Malacca means to that part
of the world what the Panama Canal
means over here.
Mahan, dead for more than 50
years, still dominates American poli-
cyâ€”or should dominate it.
