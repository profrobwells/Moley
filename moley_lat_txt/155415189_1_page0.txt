Unity Within the GOP
Real Though Obscured
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are times when a single roll
call in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives reveals more about politics, po-
litical parties and national affairs
than all the political wiseacres and
commentators can tell us. One such
instance was a vote on a motion to
recommit President Johnson's rent
subsidy plan.
The plan itself was just a bureau-
cratic brainstorm which L.B.J. seized
upon as another vote-cadging de-
vice. I shall omit a discussion of its
demerits here because the vote itself
is what is significant.
*
There were 190 votes to recommit
and 198 not to recommit, and so the
issue still remains before Congress.
The Democrats were widely split on
the issue, and all but six of the Re-
publicans voted to recommit. If five
of the six Republicans had voted
with their Republican colleagues,
the plan would have been dead in
this session.
Four of the six Republicans who
voted with the Johnson Democrats
were from New York. One was from
Michigan and the other was from
Maine.
This reveals a number of signifi-
cant facts about the Republican Par-
ty in the House and in the nation.
*
Despite so much talk about Repub-
lican disunity, the GOP members in
the House are well united, active
and disciplined. The defection of on-
ly six shows that.
The House Republicans have
shown great industry in this session
in formulating policies on the basis
of which they propose to go to the
country in November and win back
most of the seats that they lost in
1964.
If the prediction of a Republican
gain of 40 to 50 seats is fulfilled in
November, the GOP will become a
formidable opposition party in 1967
and 1968.
*
Most important, this vote shows
that, despite talk about a big Repub-
lican split among "liberals," "conser-
vatives" and/or "moderates," there
is substantial unity in the party out-
side New York. The 1964 struggle
over ideology which proved to be so
disastrous was really more con-
cerned with power than with prin-
ciples.
Republicans In the Northeast—
call them, if you will, the "eastern
establishment"—had won the Pres-
idential nomination in five of the six
Presidential years beginning in
1940. In 1960 the eastern group ac-
cepted Nixon because he was the
Eisenhower choice, and they accept-
ed him despite the early opposition
of Rockefeller and the eastern politi-
cians.
In 1964 their monopoly was sud-
denly challenged by Goldwater's
supporters in the West, South and
Midwest. Rather than accepting the
inevitable loss of party control, they
raised wild cries about extremism.
In fact, they did it so effectively be-
fore the nomination that they gave
the issue to the Johnson-Humphrey
ticket. As I said in a talk which I
made recently, "they gave Mr. John-
son the bass drum and all he had to
do was to thump it."
The four New York Republicans
who voted with the Democrats on
the rent subsidy issue have consis-
tently supported the liberal wing of
the Democratic Party. This is large-
ly because of the very special nature
of the voting population in the me-
tropolitan area. It seems to be esta-
blished that in order to win in that
area it is necessary to vote in every
instance for welfare measures.

While many other American cities
have an increasing number of
Negroes in their voting population,
New York City's minority problem is
intensified by hundreds of Puerto
Rican immigrants. The city also has
Congressman Adam Clayton Powell,
who dominates most of Harlem.
These minorities will hold the ba-
lance of power indefinitely. The offi-
cial Republican Party in New York
City is merely an aggregation of poli-
ticians who have accepted defeat as
a way of life.
*
An ever-growing managed New
York City Democratic majority now
threatens to exceed the normal Re-
publican majority in upstate New
York. In Republican calculations
New York State thus becomes less
important. This in turn lessens the
influence of Rockefeller and Javits
in national politics.
Elsewhere, however, Republican
prospects in 1966 grow brighter and
brighter.
