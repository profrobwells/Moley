'Ghost' at New Deal's 'Inquest'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This is written after a seminar on
the stirring events of the 1930s, giv-
en on the campus of Claremont
Men's College. I had the pleasure of
participating in that meeting, which
was one of a series of annual recon-
siderations of the American political
tradition.
As another survivor of the first
Roosevelt administration, my friend
and associate, Rexford G. Tugwell,
was with me. Presiding at the even-
ing meeting in which Tugwell and I
offered reminiscences was Nick
Williams, editor of The Los Angeles
Times.
At several round-tables, the speak-
ers were for the most part professors
in various institutions who present-
ed their ideas about the significance
of what happened in the early—or
first—New Deal era.

The impression I have carried
away from this event has, I be-
lieve, a significance for anyone who
reads any history of the past. For
Tugwell and I were able to listen to
the philosophical and historical con-
clusions about events in 1933 in
which we had been rather intimate
participants and witnesses.
We—or I at any rate—felt like
ghosts returned to a coroner's in-
quest over an affair in which we had
been present.
Historians tend toward broad gen-
eralizations about periods which
are more or less distant from their
present perspective. Centuries come
to be bracketed: the Age of Pericles,
the Roman Republic, the Decline
and Fall of Rome, the Middle Ages,
the Renaissance, the Age of Enlight-
enment.
In American history shorter eras
are marked: the Virginia Dynasty,
the Age of Jackson, the Progressive
Movement.
These general descriptions are
readily identified by a few events,
but too often miss the vast differen-
ces within any period and also the
variety of facts which are incapable
of such easy bracketing.
It is so, even as we come to mod-
ern time in America. And one dan-
ger in such historical generalizations
is that they lose the connections
which tie the whole past together in
one succession of events and condi-
tions.
In Pollock and Maitland's great
"History of English Law," the first
sentence is: "Such is the unity of all
history that anyone who endeav-
ors to tell a piece of it must feel that
his first sentence tears a seamless
web."
This was especially true of the
early New Deal. It was not so new at
all. Its reforms had a flavor of many
things which had preceded it. It had
a bit of populism, plenty of the pro-
gressivism of 20 years before, some
of T. R.'s New Nationalism, some of
Wilson's New Freedom and a good
deal of what happened when Har-
ding, Coolidge and Hoover were
Presidents.
The New Deal was not of one
piece. It was a composite of many
ideas. It had something new, some-
thing borrowed and plenty of im-
provisations and compromises.
There were a lot of new people in
it. But they came bringing with
them much of the past.

What is so often missed by histo-
rians who write of a past in which
they did not participate is that the
people who did participate were con-
cerned with the day-to-day tasks of
government, with making quick de-
cisions, often without the time to
consider all alternatives and never
with the option of doing more than
one thing at a time.
Participants can't take much time
to think. The last thing they can do
is to fit their actions into the frame-
work of a philosophy.
And so, as I reflect upon those ex-
citing months of 1933, I realize that
we were dealing with two pressing
necessities: One, to keep the ma-
chinery of government in motion, to
help individuals and businesses to
stay alive; and at the same time to
revive the confidence of the people
in their capacity to recover from the
depths of the depression. The people
of the nation didn't understand what
we were doing. But they were con-
vinced that a lot of things were be-
ing done. And that alone gave them
the spirit to carry on.
It was the confidence of the public
rather than any specific reforms
that led to the recovery that fol-
lowed.
That is a lesson that historians
must learn.
