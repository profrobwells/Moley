Toward Improvement of
Our City Governments
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are economic, ethnic and
geographical factors that have con-
tributed to the decline of American
cities. Here I am referring to what
are called our "central" cities, as dis-
tinguished from urban areas of
which the legally constituted city is
only a part.
But in any appraisal of the causes
of the decline, wasteful, inefficient
and generally unintelligent city
government must bear its share of
the blame.

I am not willing to attribute bad
city government to economic, ethnic
and geographical factors alone. The
city would still be a glaring example
of the failure of free institutions
even if the business and industrial
sources of revenue had not fled
along with people to the surround-
ing areas, even if in the northern
cities Negroes and other impover-
ished people had not come in to take
the places of the refugees to the su-
burbs or even if the automobile had
not eaten up so much of the city's
land areas.
Learned and experienced obser-
vers, some of them from abroad,
have pointed out, ever since the
Tweed days a century ago, the fail-
ure of our cities to govern them-
selves effectively. In those earlier
years there were no suburbs, no
great numbers of Negroes in the
northern cities and no automobiles.
The basic causes of bad city govern-
ment cannot be attributed to visible
circumstances.
During all these years there have
been many people in our cities who
have deplored the shortcomings and
evils with which their governments
have been afflicted. Many reformers
have been willing temporarily to
give time and substance to civic
uplift, and preachers have thun-
dered from their pulpits about crime
and corruption.
Occasionally those voices have
aroused an electoral majority and
have thrown the rascals out. But al-
ways, after a short spell of reform,
the rascals or their like have re-
turned to the seats of power. And
the public has again bowed its collec-
tive head.

How can it be that good people
blessed with education, pride and
plenty of worldly goods have en-
dured these miseries?
There is a shrewd appraisal of this
in a new book by a man who surely
should know his city—inside, out-
side and underside. The book is "Be-
hind Closed Doors" (Harcourt,
Brace & World), and the author is
Edward N. Costikyan, a good lawyer
who after serving his district as
leader for some years became Demo-
cratic leader in New York County in
1962. He retired from that position
two years later, with his memories
and his reflections, to write his book.
The nub of Costikyan's book is
that reformers are generally indivi-
dualists, unable to organize them-
selves. When they do organize, cohe-
sion among them ends after the
"throw-out-the-rascals" routine has
ended in victory. He believes in par-
ty government and, therefore, holds
that reform must come from within
the party system rather than from
outside. The most unfortunate cha-
racteristic of the activity of good
men is that their means of rallying
support is anti-party.
My own observation is that collec-
tive efforts for better government
lack the hard cement that holds
even good men together.
You can organize an appetite for
gain of some material sort. That is
why labor, business and even agri-
culture form lasting organizations.
Except for the hope of some tax re-
lief, the objectives of government re-
form are subjective rather than ob-
jective.
Mere civic pride and the sense of
satisfaction in having a good govern-
ment are fragile matters. Especially
after the bad people are put out and
good ones are running the govern-
ment, even those idealistic motives
peter out. Why strive for good gov-
ernment when you already have it?
You can organize hatred of wrong
and indignation over injustice. But
after reformers
are installed in of-
fice, a majority of
voters turn to oth-
er more immediate
concerns. And
those who make a
living in politics
come back and
win the next elec-
tion. To most of us,
unless our own in-
terests are con-
cerned, good and
efficient government is only one of
the values that make up our lives.
The realistic solution is the pre-
sence of two parties which man the
offices with people who have the
practical skills in politics and who
still recognize that the people who
do the heavy work in the districts
and precincts must have some legiti-
mate patronage—gainful work or
privilege.
We muddle along, delegating the
business of politics and government
to the professional politicians, with
occasional spasms of reform that
provide a certain stimulus to those
who serve us.
What is needed is a better type of
professional. Reform that scorns
professionalism in politics defeats its
own end. For it acts to discourage
well-qualified people from making
political professionalism a life occu-
pation.
