The House of Representatives
may not have the color and popular
prestige of the Senate, but over the
years it has served as the substantial
forge upon which national policies
have been hammered out and
shaped to the advantage of us all.
That is why the national interest is
best served when the House mem-
bership represents the best balance
in our two-party system.
Two elections, in 1962 and 1964,
gave the Democrats a top-heavy ma-
jority in the House.
*
In the months that followed the
disastrous election in 1964 the Re-
publican Party seemed to be gripped
by a fatal decrepitude. Some were
talking about a new alignment in the
party system. But the climate in
1966 seems favorable to a substantial
Republican recovery. I shall list the
portents, so far as the House is con-
cerned:
1-The image of Lyndon B. John-
son as an unparalleled political oper-
ator, which emerged after the elec-
tion in 1964 and which was brilliant-
ly illuminated when Congress obe-
diently adopted his many programs
in 1965. has measurably faded.
His skills as a parliamentary lead-
er served him well in getting legisla-
tion passed in 1965. But now, when
the management of these programs
faces him, his limitations as an exe-
cutive become a serious matter. The
talent available to organize and
manage the many programs is
scarce. and the President is not too
skillful in inducing what talent there
is to enter the public service.
The poverty program is already
bogged down in a morass of waste
and political corruption. Medicare
may be another splitting administra-
tive headache.
2-The war in Vietnam has creat-
ed a strong minority in the Democra-
tic Party which opposes the Pres-
ident with increasing bitterness. The
liberal wing represented by the
ADA is reappraising its earliest esti-
mate of L.B.J. A very strong protest
vote is likely in November which
has no option except to benefit Re-
publican candidates even though it
has little in common with the GOP.
3-Inflation is no longer a threat
but a reality. The economic law that
upsets the balance between the mo-
ney supply and the volume of pur-
chasable goods cannot be repealed
by any act of Congress or adminis-
trative adjustments.
4-One might expect that higher
prices of commodities would raise
the prices of equities in the stock
market. But uncertainty about the
market for money and business pros-
pects later in the year is a powerful
bearish influence.
5-The behavior of the Republi-
can leadership in Congress has been
very astute. It has strongly support-
ed the Johnson policy in foreign af-
fairs, but it has been actively critical
of Mr. Johnson's domestic spending.
And it has seized upon inflation as a
1966 campaign issue.
6-Since 1964 was such an abnor-
mal year, a large number of exper-
ienced Republicans lost their seats
in the House, many by very small
margins. Those unseated Republi-
cans have been in their home dis-
tricts making new friends and ce-
menting their relations with old
ones.
*
Meanwhile, their Democratic suc-
cessors, freshmen congressmen,
have been living in Washington try-
ing to learn what they can. Their
votes have not been needed because
of the immense Democratic majori-
ty, and so they have been neglected
by their leaders.
These superfluous statesmen-71
of the House membership-frozen in
Washington because of the long ses-
sion. are feeling the clutch of doom.
Six months ago good observers be-
lieved that 25 or 30 would lose in
1966. Now the estimate is 50 or
more.
7-Redistricting in several states
has given these new members recon-
structed districts to capture. Under
redistricting, more seats have been
created in the suburbs and in the
areas beyond the suburbs than in
the central cities. It is generally Re-
publican territory.
Thus, the GOP may well emerge
in November with greater strength
as an opposition party.
