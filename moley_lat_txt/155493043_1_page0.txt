Lyndon B. Johnson, beset by criti-
cism from his own Democratic
friends in the Senate, deeply con-
scious of the polls showing the de-
cline in his popularity and irritated
by demonstrations against our posi-
tion in Vietnam, has apparently de-
cided that the best defense is an of-
fense, military and oratorical.
The long and at times impas-
sioned speech in Omaha clearly
showed this attitude, coming as it
did immediately after the intensifi-
cation of bombing of North Vietnam.
At one point in that speech he spoke
some words that were apparently
strictly Johnsonian. I doubt whether
any White House ghost would have
supplied them:
"I hear my friends say that I am
troubled and I am confused and I am
frustrated . . . Sometimes I almost
develop a stomach ulcer myself just
listening to them."
The second of the two sentences
really confirms the first. At least the
friends to whom he refers were right
when they said he was "troubled."
But his response is a counteroffen-
sive which denies that he is "con-
fused" or "frustrated."
His recent utterances are a very
human and understandable re-
sponse to the defectors in his own
party. And Americans who compre-
hend what he is facing will be sym-
pathetic, even touched by his ap-
peal.
But that his remarkable political
sense is still operating is shown by
his selection of Nebraska and Iowa
as the region in which he chose to
make his appeal for support. He
turns in this crisis to the Midwest
and West not because he finds the
center of his opposition there, but
because that is where his firmest
support lies in stepping up the war
in Asia.
In this great controversy, doves
can be found in widely scattered pla-
ces over the nation, but for the most
part they cluster in the East and
Northeast. Pacifism is most
marked in the intellectual and poli-
tical life of New York.
In the congressional district in
which I live and work, the 17th New
York which Mayor John Lindsay
formerly represented, we are faced
this year with a choice between a
Republican and a Democrat, both of
whom want us, as L.B.J. put it, to
"tuck up our tail and run out of
South Vietnam." Our New York sen-
ators, Jacob Javits and Robert Ken-
nedy, are cooing across party lines.
The New York newspapers, except-
ing the Daily News, the only ones
that are published at present, are ar-
dently opposed to the new bombing
offensive.
On the other side of the country,
especially in the states that look to-
ward the Pacific, where I spent two
weeks in June, the support of the
new Johnson hard line is undi-
minished.
This East-West division of opi-
nion is not new. In 1916 and 1940
when the shadows of the wars in
Europe were looming, pacifist sen-
timent was greatest in the Midwest
and West. In the eastern seaboard
the sentiment for war was pro-
nounced, for vast economic interests
looked toward Europe.
In the years before the United
States entered the war in 1917, al-
most overwhelming sentiment
leaned toward helping the Allies
against Germany. Much the same
sentiment was present in the two
years before Pearl Harbor.
Now the state of opinion is re-
versed.
The Johnson defense of intensi-
fying the pressure on North Viet-
nam is still impaired, I believe, by
his concentration on helping South
Vietnam to establish itself as a "dem-
ocratic" non-Communist state.
It would be more effective,
however, if he would concentrate on
the point which he barely mentions
--the American interest in keeping
a bastion of power in Southeast Asia
to protect the lifeline from Japan to
Australia and India.
That is the real meaning of our
policy. For if Southeast Asia is over-
run by Communists, we may well be
fighting in the Philippines next.
And beyond that, a retreat to For-
tress America.
