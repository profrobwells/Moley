Two Miscalculations May
Dethrone Robert Kennedy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For a brief spell, from the moment
of his election as U.S. senator in
1964, Robert F. Kennedy, despite his
scanty residence qualifications, has
been hailed as the Democratic boss
of the State of New York.
This eminence was accorded Sen.
Kennedy because of a dearth of possible
rivals. His election made him
New York's only Democratic U.S.
senator; the other seat and the
governorship were held by Republicans.
Mayor Wagner's long service
as mayor of New York City was
nearing the end, and after he declined
to run again, the city hall was
occupied by a nominal Republican.
Control of the Democratic Party machinery
was not only scattered but
embroiled in factional struggles.
★
In the past Democratic leadership
has usually been maintained either
by undisputed leaders in New York
City such as Charles F. Murphy and
Edward J. Flynn or by strong Democratic
governors like Alfred E.
Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
With Kennedy's base thus seemingly
secured in the Empire State,
with his brother Edward the junior
senator from Massachusetts, with
presented to him a critical and dangerous
matter for decision.
What if he endorsed one and another
secured the nomination at the
convention? Then his prestige
would drop several notches. If he
failed to endorse any of them and
the nominee won the governorship,
Kennedy's ascendancy would be
challenged by the new governor. If
he picked a candidate who was subsequently
defeated by Rockefeller,
he would earn the enmity of the supporters
of the other candidates.
★
He finally decided "to let the convention
choose" the candidate.
Thereupon, the candidate he probably
favored, Eugene Nickerson,
dropped out of the contest.
Meanwhile, Frank O'Connor, former
district attorney of Queens and
now president of the city council,
took his case in his own hands. It is
reliably believed that O'Connor was
the one of the four candidates whom
Kennedy did not want. But the
proved vote-getting potential of
O'Connor so impressed county leaders
and delegates that he is virtually
assured of the nomination. And Kennedy
must, however reluctantly,
support him in his campaign.
All this has gravely impaired confidence
in Kennedy's judgment, always
a fatal blow to any boss.
At the same time, Kennedy's performance
on the national scene has
seriously threatened his reputation
as a sophisticated politician. For he
chose to join the doves in opposition
to Mr. Johnson's policies in Vietnam.
Here, perhaps his bitterness
toward Mr. Johnson rather than his
love of peace was a motivating force.
But recent primary results and
the tests of public opinion show
growing support for Mr. Johnson's
firmness in pressing the war effort.
This autumn will produce unhealthy
weather for doves. And if
Kennedy takes the trouble to read
history, he will learn that for a political
figure to oppose a war already
underway—especially when the incumbent
President is of his own party—
means almost certain political
demise.
If President Johnson's efforts in
Vietnam prove successful, Robert
Kennedy may well vanish as a
threat to Mr. Johnson for all time.
In New York O'Connor, running
with no obligations to Kennedy,
may expect that the Johnson administration
will give him every means
of support.
The status of a boss is always dependent
upon the rightness of his
judgments. And Kennedy has already
made two miscalculations of
great importance. The myth of his
sophistication is fading. He retains
the Kennedy name and the Kennedy
money. But after this he may
emerge as just another junior senator.
