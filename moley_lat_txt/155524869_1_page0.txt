Ribicoff May Learn From
Urban Affairs 'Experts'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff and his
subcommittee are off on another of
what the senator calls his crusades.
And sitting at his left—in every
sense—is Robert Kennedy, seizing
every opportunity to browbeat wit-
nesses. He has his crusade, too,
which is to do his best to displace
Lyndon B. Johnson's leadership of
the national Democratic Party.
The two senators collaborated in
Ribicoff's 1965-1966 crusade, which
was concerned with automotive
safety. But, as in any such investi-
gations, the thrust of the inquiry
was diverted from the broader pur-
pose of making highways and auto-
mobile driving safer.
The lurid headlines were gained
by depicting what happened in the
car after the accident, rather than
concentrating on the prevention of
the accident itself. As a conse-
quence, the whole affair became a
virulent attack on the automobile
manufacturers. The legislation that
emerged will do little to make driv-
ing safer, as will be seen in the next
few years when the casualty figures
come in.
The present crusade, which Ribi-
coff says will last two years and will
get into the record the views of in-
numerable public officials and ex-
perts who know something of city
problems, may well serve a useful
purpose. That is, it will be useful if
the political objectives of Robert
Kennedy can be kept to a mini-
mum.
The first question is: "What kind
of cities should we have?"
To answer this leads into as large
a basket of eels as has ever been
handed our governments. It is not
one problem; it is a mass of interre-
lated problems. Collectively, this
complex is the greatest issue before
this generation of Americans. And
since our urban communities are in
a profound state of change, it is most
difficult to foresee what and how
much should be done. More impor-
tant is the question of who shall do
what is needed and how.
It seems to be assumed by the in-
quisitors that the federal govern-
ment must bear the main responsibi-
lity for urban problems. This was re-
cognized when Congress, under
pressure from President Johnson,
created a Department of Housing
and Urban Development. But hardly
had Robert C. Weaver, the new cabi-
net member, been installed when it
was recognized that many of the ur-
ban problems were scattered in oth-
er departments and agencies. And
now we hear of still another depart-
ment, to deal with transportation.

The first week of Ribicoff hear-
ings was devoted to the testimony of
Weaver, Atty. Gen. Katzenbach, Se-
cretary Gardner of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare, and Sargent
Shriver, who runs various agencies
including the poverty outfit.
The outcome was a dreadful dis-
play of confusion in the federal
bureaucracy itself. Indeed, the com-
plexity of the urban problems seems
rivaled by the complexity and confu-
sion of the federal agencies. No one
seemed to know which was doing
what. Weaver said the federal
government was spending $28 bil-
lion on urban programs. The next
day the attorney general guessed
that the figure was $14 billion.
"We really don't know the an-
swers," Ribicoff concluded after
those hearings. The federal govern-
ment is spending a lot, he recog-
nized. But the subcommittee doesn't
know how much and the cabinet
cannot agree among its own mem-
bers.

The next week's inquisition yield-
ed little more. Since New York City
is the nation's most populous, it was
assumed that New York's ebullient
new major, John V. Lindsay, would
have a lot of answers. But all he had
to offer was the suggestion of feder-
al handouts at the rate of $5 billion a
year or $50 billion in 10 years. He
hadn't much to propose as specifics
except such items as air condition-
ing the subways and more of every-
thing the city is now getting. He
said he wanted New York to be a
more "exciting" place to live.
As a resident, I might add that if
the place gets more exciting than it
is, I will join the parade of New
Yorkers who are moving to Connec-
ticut and New Jersey.
Perhaps when Ribicoff gets to real
experts on urban affairs he will hear
some interesting things. Certainly,
no one in Washington has much to
offer except more taxpayers' money.
