Doubts Cast on Warren
Report Have Substance
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Johnson's purpose in
creating the Warren Commission
was to prevent the growth of irre-
sponsible rumor and speculation
about the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. But now, nearly three
years after the tragedy and more
than two years since the Warren re-
port was made public, rumor, specu-
lation and wild surmise still prevail.
What is more, public confidence in
the commission's competence has
been almost fatally destroyed.
*
The amazing thing about this re-
vival of interest in the case is that
the most penetrating criticism of the
commission and its report has been
contributed not by a distinguished
lawyer, judge or statesman. It is em-
bodied in a book written by a 30-
year-old graduate student who be-
gan his research as a routine aca-
demic assignment.
Edward Jay Epstein was a
student at Cornell, and his professor
suggested that as an exercise in polit-
ical science he write his Master's
thesis on the Warren Commission,
for that body represented an inter-
esting example of an extra-judicial
and quasi-official method of investi-
gating a murder of great national
importance.
The President was moved to
create the commission because the
customary investigative agencies-
the FBI, the Secret Service and the
law-enforcement machinery in
Texas-were in a sense parties of in-
terest, for they all had borne some
responsibility for the security of the
President. A congressional commit-
tee, despite the probity of its mem-
bers, might have been harmful to
the public interest.

But Epstein, working for many
months without any of the powerful
authority given to the Warren Com-
mission, has shown in his book, "In-
quest," that the chief justice and his
associates failed in their task in
many vital respects.
The members of the commission
were most distinguished people who
because of their many commitments
gave inadequate time to their work.
The associate counsel were busy
lawyers and bestowed upon their
subordinates most of the essential
tasks of the investigation.
A great number of witnesses were
heard, but there was very little
cross-examination, which would
have served to straighten out the
discrepancies and contradictions in
their testimony. Certain witnesses
who might have been most useful
were not questioned at all.
And in the hasty writing of the fi-
nal report there seemed to be an ef-
fort to concentrate the guilt upon
Oswald and to depict him as an indi-
vidual-a "loner"-who, for reasons
which have never been established,
planned and carried out the crime
with no accomplices and never a
clear motive.
That more than one weapon was
used by more than one person was
not effectively pursued, although
the available evidence seems to
point to that probability.
In summing up, Epstein says in
substance that while the commis-
sion was designed to accomplish two
purposes-find the facts and allay
public suspicions-the latter pur-
pose got squarely in the way of the
first.
Despite the efforts of the commis-
sion, the researches of Epstein and
many others who have written ar-
ticles and books during the past
months have clearly shaken the be-
lief of many thoughtful people that
the case was closed when Warren
submitted his report to the Pres-
ident in 1964.
My space here does not permit a
review of the evidence. The reader
may find that in
Epstein's book. But
after a careful
reading of the Ep-
stein thesis and a
rereading of the
conclusions in the
Warren report, I
must be counted
among the doubt-
ers. Prior to the
tragedy of Nov. 22,
1963, three Presi-
dents were assas-
sinated. In two cases the assassing,
Booth and Czologosz, were political-
ly motivated. Guiteav, who killed
President Garfield, clearly acted on
his own.
In the former two cases the prior
associations were in the nature of a
conspiracy. In the case of Oswald
there were suspicious earlier politi-
cal associations. The failure of the
Warren Commission to trace those
associations constitutes, in my judg-
ment, the most serious flaw in the
report.
In an eloquent brief submitted by
Louis Nizer, a notable trial lawyer
himself, as an introduction to the
Doubleday edition of the Warren re-
port, the author quotes:
"We see yonder the beginning of the
day, but
I think we shall never see the end
of it."
That is true. Certainly not in this
century.
