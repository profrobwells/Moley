Sen. Byrd's Influence
Was Based in Character
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In writing a history of the First
New Deal—now completed—I often
had the feeling of cutting a way
through a thicket of memories
peopled by near-forgotten ghosts.
But what I witnessed on March 4,
1933, stands out clearly from all the
rest of those days. For I saw the
Senate called to order minutes after
Franklin D. Roosevelt finished his
inaugural address. In the chair was
John N. Garner, who had just taken
his own oath of office.
*
A great and awesome stillness
prevailed in a stricken and frightened
country. Three years of depression
had culminated in the closing of
the banks. And the business before
Congress in the week to come was
to validate the President’s order closing
the banks and to provide for the
banks’ reopening. It was that, perhaps,
which made this opening of
Congress so significant.
A minor incident is memorable.
For on that day, after the Vice
President called
the Senate to order, the venerable
gentleman from
Virginia, Carter
Glass, rose from
his seat and offered
the credentials
which admitted
to membership
in the Senate a
man who in age
might have been
his son.
That man, in his 46th year, was
Harry Flood Byrd. The appointment
of the junior senator by Virginia’s
governor came, interestingly
enough, because of a decision by Mr.
Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt sought, by
the appointment of Virginia’s already
aging Sen. Claude Swanson as secretary
of the Navy, to achieve two
things. One was to permit Key Pittman,
a stalwart supporter, to move
up to the chairmanship of the
Foreign Relations Committee. The
other was to place the custody of his
beloved Navy with a completely
sympathetic secretary.
*
Perhaps had Mr. Roosevelt known
that his decision would place in the
Senate a man who over the years
would, always with discretion and
courtesy, oppose his favorite policies,
he might have hesitated to
create the vacancy from Virginia.
For the new senator proved himself
as the years passed a resolute warrior
for fiscal responsibility and a valiant
opponent of growing federal
power.
The strength and influence of
Byrd grew until, as chairman of the
powerful Senate Finance Committee,
he was the leading American exponent
of sound fiscal policy and of
the constitutional balance of powers
between states and the federal
government.
*
Moreover, Sen. Byrd at all times
stood for something greater than
himself. He represented all the fine
traditions so cherished by the great
state of Virginia. He maintained organized
political authority in his
state, and through his influence that
state met its problems of growth
with enlightened responsibility. In a
nation in which so many states have
become mere fiefdoms of a federal
bureaucracy, Virginia has maintained
its sovereignty and its capacity
to speak for itself.
Back in 1941 Sen. Byrd, deeply
concerned about the growth of
bureaucracy and of improvident
spending, secured the creation of the
Joint Committee on Reduction of
Non-Essential Federal Expenditures,
of which he was chairman. It
was a tribute to the confidence in
him in the Senate that twice when
Republicans controlled the Senate
he was retained in that chairmanship.
Month after month his committee
provided the record of the nation’s
finances and the number of federal
employees.
*
The traditions which Byrd represented
were Wilsonian. But far back
before President Wilson—and even
beyond the Confederacy—the roots
were in the principles for which
great Virginians fought before the
Revolution. Whoever visits Williamsburg
and is moved by the reminders
there of Wythe, Washington,
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and
George Mason should remind himself
that nearly two centuries later
Harry Byrd stood firmly for the
faith of those men. His memory is
with them in a great tradition.
If we look for an explanation of
Byrd’s lasting influence we must
find the answer in his character. In
a tribute to Byrd, this was said:
“Issues are eternally debatable;
but character is not. Harry Byrd
symbolizes a vanishing era of public
men who stood to the end in awareness
that their true and ultimate responsibility
was to country and to
history.”
