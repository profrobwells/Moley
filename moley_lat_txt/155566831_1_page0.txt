Presidential Campaigns
Must Adapt to Jet Age
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In my column published here last
week I noted that great mechanical
changes in communication and
transportation beginning in 1960
have profoundly altered the nature
of Presidential campaigns. In what
follows I shall briefly specify the
impact of those changes—the use of
television and jet planes—upon our
practice of choosing a President.
In 1960 the two candidates, Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon and
Sen. John F. Kennedy, joyously
accepted these mechanical monsters
and promised to make full use of
them.
When he was nominated, Nixon
promised to campaign in 50 states.
By inference at least Mr. Kennedy
agreed to meet the challenge mile
for mile. After delays caused by
Nixon’s hospitalization and by the
necessity that Mr. Kennedy attend
the August session of Congress, the
personal campaign began in mid-
September.
From the time of his nomination
Nixon traveled 65,000 miles, mostly
by air. He made 180 scheduled
speeches and an equal number of
unscheduled talks. There were many
press conferences, television
appearances and informal gatherings.
Mr. Kennedy’s program was
scarcely less ambitious.
Because of this frantic pace, both
candidates by late October were
drained and spent physically, mentally
and emotionally. And so were
their managers, helpers and the
newspaper reporters who followed
them. I cannot speak of the condition
of the millions who witnessed
this performance. But I venture to
say that they were more confused
and less informed than they had
ever been.
Any thoughtful review of that
campaign and, to a degree, the one
that followed in 1964 must bring out
a number of factors, mostly deplorable,
which have been introduced
into our political system by jet
transportation and television:
1—Television, like the stage, is
largely an exercise in make-believe.
Candidates as well as managers
become obsessed with the images of
the candidates as they are projected
on millions of screens over the
nation. Issues are subordinated to
appearances.
2—The physical and mental strain
upon the candidates and to a lesser
extent upon their helpers and the
reporters who “cover” the proceedings
makes an enlightened exposition
of the issues virtually impossible.

3—Vast sums of money are required
in this new era of the jet and
TV. The advantage then goes to the
candidate with a fortune of his own
or with a rich family or money from
special interests. An incumbent
President suffers less from this
factor because he has so much free
exposure.
4—Adequate press or television
coverage is impossible. For when a
candidate makes appearances in
three to five states a day it is
literally impossible for any reporter
to provide a condensed or coherent
account of what has been said.
If we assume that these conditions
will prevail in future campaigns,
what standards of eligibility will
guide the people who select the
candidates? Pre-eminent will be a
sort of screen test. How does he
appear on television? What about
his physical stamina? How old is he?
These matters will prevail over
experience or issues.
Such exacting and mostly irrelevant
standards will affect the decisions
of potential candidates. Many
will be eligible for the office of
President. But few will be willing to
pay the price of seeking the office.
Since President Johnson will almost
certainly be one of the candidates
in 1968 and since as President
he will have a number of advantages,
the burden of rationalizing
campaign methods will fall upon
Republican leaders and potential
candidates. With some imagination
and ingenuity, television and jet
transportation can still be adapted
to the use of campaigning in a way
which will inform rather than confuse
the electorate.
