Californians Showed Great
Wisdom in Recent Election
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The California electorate, which
has too often in the past been the ob-
ject of highbrow ridicule, vindicated
itself this year in two important re-
spects. First, it did not hold that a
man who is a professional actor
should for that reason be barred
from a high public office. Second, it
chose, hy an overwhelming majori-
ty, as lieutenant governor a man
who by any test in academic circles
would qualify as a true intellectual.
Toward the end Gov. Edmund G.
Brown sharpened his attack on his
opponent by saying that John
Wilkes Booth was also an actor. It
is a pity that Ronald Reagan did
not reply that while he and Booth
were, in truth, actors, Pat Brown
was surely not playing the role of
Abraham Lincoln.

By electing Bob Finch to the of-
fice of lieutenant governor, Califor-
nia made a decision that should go a
long way to destroy the prejudice
which has always handicapped men
of fine intelligence and education in
seeking a political career. Although
Finch is not a professor, I am sure
that he would qualify for member-
ship in any faculty. His post-grad-
uate training was several years in
political management. He ran once,
unsuccessfully, for Congress.
In offering himself as a candidate
for lieutenant governor, Finch faced
another taboo. Ed Flynn, who was
Franklin Roosevelt's master strate-
gist, never sought elective office for
himself. He told me that a political
manager should never be a candi-
date. The mental attitude of a candi-
date, Flynn said, is quite detached
from the qualifications and conduct
of a manager.

Over the past decade Finch has
given his energies to managing the
political fortunes of other people. He
served for some time in the 1950s as
executive for the Republican Asso-
ciates of Los Angeles. For a while
before 1960 he was Vice President
Nixon's assistant in seeking the
nomination. In the months that fol-
lowed he shared with Len Hall the
management of Nixon's campaign.
He worked also in Nixon's campaign
for governor in 1962. In 1964 he
managed George Murphy's remark-
ably successful try for the Senate.
And then, after working for so
many others, he sought something
on his own. He started early and
prepared well. His major problem
was to make himself known to the
immense population of the state.
Last February, with the primaries
ahead, I talked with Finch and
wrote for publication the following
summary of his political manifesto:
"Finch, correctly it seems to me,
conceives that the people of this
country since the confusion of 1964
have grown sick and tired of old
ideological expressions such as
'liberal,' 'conservative,' 'left' and
'right,' 'moderate,' 'radical' and 'ex-
treme' this or that. The glue on the
old party labels doesn't stick any
more

"Finch makes the relevant point
that the United States is at the end
of one era and entering another.
Within a relatively few years three
of every four Americans will live
and work in a few great megalopoli-
tan areas. In California there is in
the making a vast urban and semi-
urban complex stretching from the
Golden Gate to San Diego... It will
be so throughout the nation—from
Boston to Washington, from Pitts-
burgh to Milwaukee and elsewhere.
"The federal government is
somewhat but not clearly aware of
this change
But despite its
pretentions and
billions of expen-
ditures, the feder-
al establishment
cannot alone meet
the problems of
these population
congestions. The
limits of federal
spending are al-
ready in sight.

"This is not to
say along with some reactionaries
that we must repeal the federal
trend of the past 30 years. That was
an era when Washington helped on
the local levels. Now, looking ahead,
the local levels must help the federal
establishment to carry the burden.
The latent resources in wealth and
talent are there at those levels. They
must be mobilized."
Perhaps this sounds academic to
some who are familiar with the slop-
py jargon of politics. But the appeal
of Finch's quiet personality and the
logic of his arguments won him re-
spect and support. His majority over
his opponent, the incumbent and
well-entrenched lieutenant governor,
was an amazing 1,221,917 votes. This
surpassed Reagan's margin over
Brown by 256,019. It is a tribute to
youth, candor and reliance upon a
new, fresh expression of the issues.
