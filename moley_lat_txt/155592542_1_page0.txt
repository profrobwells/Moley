Mechanics of Presidential
Elections Radically Altered
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Nixon-Kennedy contest for
the Presidency should be memorab-
le for a very special reason. For it
was, the first of our quadrennial
affairs in which the impact of a
meclianical revolution in communi-
cation and transportation was felt in
full force.
The lessons from that campaign
had better be fully digested or our
choice of a President will be
determined by the caprice of mecha-
nical monsters. This will not only
affect the course of national policy,
but will determine the sort of people
who will be eligible to run for the
office.
A great deal has been written
about the 1960 campaign and the
one that followed in 1964. There
have been bits of memoirs-some
self-serving, some crammed with.
interesting anecdotes. But there has
been no real examination of the
impact of television and the jet
plane upon the choice of our chief
magistrate and, because of that,
upon the institutions of a free
society..
It is my purpose in this article and
another which will follow next week
to suggest, such a fundamental
examination and in a preliminary
way to offer means to regain the
influence of reason and an orderly
delineation of the issues for the
electorate.
In 1896 the traveling candidate
was projected into Presidential cam-
paigns. William Jennings Bryan had
little money, and since his candida-
cy was abhorred by the moneyed
interests of the East his party lived
on meager rations.
It was noted at the time that
Bryan had to borrow $50 to attend
the Chicago convention at which he
was nominated. But he was only 36
years old. He was vigorous and
extremely handsome. Most impor-
tant, he had cultivated the art of
oratory since his school days.
Moreover, his promise was to war on
poverty simply by adding to the
volume of money..
The Bryan traveling campaign.
made use of coaches by day and
ordinary Pullman berths by night.
Perhaps with the help of television
and jet transport Bryan could have
"sold" his panacea to the electorate.
William, McKinley, his opponent,
remained at his home in Canton,
Ohio, while Mark Hanna, with
contributions said to amount to the
unprecedented 'sum of $6 million;
won the election for him with an
"educational" campaign by means of
the printing press and some subsi-.
dizing of local organizations.
Theodore Roosevelt, running for
Vice President in 1900 and for
President four years later, adopted
the Bryan method of traveling to the
voters. All the Roosevelts believed
that a good trip justified any cause.
To a lesser degree, all candidates
thereafter, except Warren Harding
in 1920, did plenty of traveling. But
trains were slow, and generally the
major speeches were made in big
cities, with small whistle stops in
between.
In the late 1920s the radio made a
major breakthrough in communica-
tion. And since major speeches in
1928 were broadcast to a national
audience, there was need for more
variety in their content. Prior to
that, the same specch with local
adaptations sufficed.
In 1932 there was recognition of
the importance of the radio, and a
better method of composing the
important speÄ‹ches was devised.
But except for one brief flight from
Albany to the Chicago convention
by Gov. Franklin Roosevelt, candi-
dates were earth-bound or, more
correctly, rail-bound.
Mr. Roosevelt acquired an unpre-
cedented mastery of the art of
speaking over the radio. But since
travel had to be mostly by train,
there were decent intervals for the
preparation of major speeches, and a
staff was employed to work with the
candidate on the speeches them-
scives.

It was possible for the press to
provide good coverage because of
the amount of time between major
pronouncements of policy and also
because copies of the speeches were
given to the reporters on the cam-
paign train. There was time for a
systematic briefing of the reporters
by Mr. Roosevelt's staff as the train
jogged over the states.
Morcover, the candidate's use of
the radio permitted reasoned and
systematic language. Occasionally
catchy phrases were used, but in
general the prose was not designed
for rabble-rousing. And because the
candidate stuck to his written text,
the baleful influence of crowds was
measurably eliminated.
This pattern was followed in all
the Roosevelt campaigns and by
Wendell Willkie, Thomas Dewey
and Dwight Eisenhower. Harry Tru-
man reverted to the Bryan whistle-
stopping and for the most part spoke
extemporaneously.
But by the 1950s television was
arriving, air travel had improved,
and then came the jet.
The impact of these mechanical
changes I shall explore in next
week's article..
