Robert Kennedy--Doomed
to a Final Frustration?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The vision of another Kennedy in
the White House which almost
blinded Robert F. Kennedy within
weeks after the tragic event of Nov.
22, 1963, has all but vanished into
the vale where the language is limited
to four words: "what might have
been."
Within weeks after his brother's
death, Robert conceived that the
Kennedy succession might be assured
by his nomination for Vice
President in 1964. A rather dim appraisal
of Lyndon B. Johnson, his
personal dislike of the new President,
the possibility that the next
Vice President, like the last, might
succeed to the leadership of the
state, either during the years before
1972 or by right of a nomination
when L. B. J. retired--all these enlarged
the ambition of a young man
to whom all things seemed possible.

The story of how that first goal
was missed provides a fascinating
chapter in Evans and Novak's book,
"Lyndon B. Johnson: The Exercise
of Power." The authors, obviously
with a wealth of inside information,
tell how the new President, still
quite unsure of himself at first, believed
that despite his lack of appetite
for the late President's brother,
he would be unable to deny him second
place on the 1964 ticket.
L. B. J.'s admirers were divided
on the subject. But as the seat of
power on which he sat by constitutional
right grew warmer and initial
successes with Congress provided
confidence in his own power, L. B. J.
devised the plan to rule out of consideration
all Cabinet officers and
other holdovers in the administration
he had inherited.
In the aftermath of his announcement,
made personally to the attorney
general, Mr. Johnson's confidence
bounced upward, and he
told a good many people in some detail
how he had put R. F. K. in his
place. News of this aroused the attorney
general, and there and then
any hope of a Johnson-Kennedy alliance
vanished.
★
With all hope gone with the selection
of Hubert Humphrey, R. F. K.
devised another plan. This was, as I
noted at the time, the creation of the
Kennedy hegemony to challenge the
President within the Democratic
Party itself and to build the strength
necessary to win the Presidential
nomination for R. F. K., possibly in
1968 and certainly in 1972.
While he would secure the New
York senatorship and Edward M.
Kennedy the senatorship in Massachusetts,
certain other friends
would seek office elsewhere. Pierre
Salinger moved to California, and
other supporters sought office in
other places. But Salinger was rejected
while R.F.K. and E.M.K. won.
This whole ploy was sure to fail
from its beginning. For no such seizure
of a nomination can succeed
when the opposition is in the White
House with all the instruments of
control well in hand.
With the plan for a Kennedy faction
blasted, R.F.K. tried another
route. Sensing a decline in L.B.J.'s
popularity, he spoke out in opposition
to the President's Vietnam policy
and carried his appeal to the
country. Screaming teen-agers lustily
responded. But when the election
returns came in, that strategy
proved to be a dismal failure. For
the size of crowds and even the polls
were overwhelmed by the electorate.
Two-thirds of the candidates
R.F.K. labored to elect lost. And in
New York the Democratic Party rejected
his preference for a nominee
for governor.
After all, what were R.F.K.'s assets
from the beginning? He might
have claimed that he had a mission
to help enact the unfinished programs
left by his brother. But L.B.J.
foreclosed that by stuffing the programs
down the throat of Congress
--a throat unencumbered by any polyps
of dissent.
R.F.K. might have sponsored programs
of his own and debated them
in the Senate. But he has been a do-nothing
senator. His only contribution

tion has been the negative action of
asking unpleasant questions in committee
hearings and insulting witnesses.
Constructive statesmanship
is not in his character.
His monetary assets are considerable.
But what is any personal fortune
when pitted against the boundless
treasure of the federal government?
L.B.J. has the key to that.
Finally, there is the Kennedy
image. But images fade with the inexorable
march of the years: Time
would seem to be R.F.K.'s friend at
41, but time is his relentless enemy.
By 1972 the short administration
and tragic end of the J.F.K. era will
have gathered dust in the history
books. New, fresh figures will pace
the stage. And the frustration of age
may well come to a young man who
arrived too early and aimed too high.
