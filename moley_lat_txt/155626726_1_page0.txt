President Johnson's proposal to
merge the Commerce and Labor
departments should be more than
routine congressional business. For
such a merger would save little
money directly and, because of loss
of efficiency, would probably be
more expensive.
It would create a new department
with no internal consistency, and its
head, the new secretary, would
hardly know what he was represent-
ing in cabinet discussions of nation-
al policy.
Until Congress in postwar years
imposed upon the executive a great
mass of welfare functions and sup-
ports of local governments, the ar-
rangement of federal activities into
departments was a fairly workable
administrative system.
Roughly until the creation of the
Department of Defense in 1947, the
various departments were fairly
consistent units. They were of two
kinds. Seven of them—State,
Treasury, Justice, War, Navy, In-
terior, and Post Office—managed
functions appropriate to the general
government. Three of them—Agri-
culture, Commerce and Labor—re-
cognized special economic interests.
Then came Defense and Health,
Education and Welfare with func-
tions designated by their names.
More recently the spill-over from
HEW was collected in the Housing
and Urban Development Depart-
ment. And then the President pro-
posed another, to concern itself with
transportation.

In 1903 Congress created a De-
partment of Commerce and Labor,
which a few years later was divided
into separate departments of
Commerce and Labor.
The secretaries of Agriculture,
Commerce and Labor were in a
sense representing the interests in-
dicated by their department’s name.
In the Cabinet they spoke for those
respective private interests. And to
the people of agriculture, business
and labor they spoke for and inter-
preted national policy. The bureau-
cracies they commanded were sup-
posed to serve those interests.
And now comes the proposal to
merge Commerce and Labor into a
Department of Business and Labor.
in his State of the Union message
the President said:
"I have come tonight to propose a
new department, a Department of
Business and Labor. By combining
the Department of Commerce with
the Department of Labor and other
related agencies I think that we can
create a more economical, efficient
and streamlined instrument. . . ."
The word "streamlined" has been
used endlessly to apply to such
reorganizations of government as
this. More than 40 years ago several
state governments were reorganized
on the federal plan by gathering
many agencies into a few large
departments.
This measurably made govern-
ment more understandable to the
public. And it made for some econo-
my and efficiency. That movement,
in fact, was the subject of my Ph.D.
thesis a long time ago.
But that way of promoting econo-
my and efficiency has its limits. As
far as the federal establishment is
concerned, the real road to economy
is for Congress and Mr. Johnson to
cool their passion to create new
services until what they have alrea-
dy created can be evaluated.
They might also observe more care
in dumping upon an already over-
burdened bureaucracy half-baked
contrivances to give benefits to ev-
eryone. In the past two years there
have been more ill-planned crea-
tions under the guise of "doing good
for people" than can be assimilated
in a generation.
As for merging the departments of
Commerce and Labor, the new de-
partment would be an utterly con-
fused aggregate of dissimilar activi-
ties. Both business and organized
labor would lose their accustomed
access to government and their pro-
per representation in the Cabinet.
The new secretary of Business and
Labor would be neither fish nor
fowl. All that would be saved would
be the upkeep of one top secretary.
But that saving, no doubt, would be
blotted out by the creation of several
new assistant and undersecretaries.
Instead of two fairly manageable
departments, there would be one
unmanageable department.
The improvement of administra-
tion can come only from reform in
depth, not by merely shuffling the
old cards into new decks.
