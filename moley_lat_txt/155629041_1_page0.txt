More Questions of Stennis
Committee on Sen. Dodd
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the investigation of the finances
of Sen. Thomas Dodd were a
criminal prosecution, it would be
unfortunate if not wrong to com-
ment upon the evidence until a
verdict had been reached. But the
hearings now concluded were held
by the Senate's Select Committee on
Standards and Conduct, generally
known as the "ethics" committee.
Thus, the committee headed by Sen.
John Stennis (D-Miss.) is not a
prosecuting agency, and for that
reason some guarded comments are
admissible.
We can be certain that Chairman
Stennis represents the finest, most
independent and most intelligent
standards in public life, a judgment
in which a great majority of his
senatorial colleagues would concur,
★
Stennis in his long public career
has never been prominent in the
headlines. His temperament is in
keeping with his earlier career as a
judge. He appears only occasionally
in the Congressional Record, but
when he does it is because of a
speech that displays high intel-
ligence and measured restraint. And
it is interesting that he has come
from a state, Mississippi, that has
been excoriated in the press as
benighted and lawless.
A major conclusion that one must
reach after reading the testimony of
Dodd's accusers and his own defense
before the committee and on the
Senate floor—and especially after
an examination of the stipulations or
facts agreed upon by Sen. Dodd and
the committee—is that Dodd con-
ducted the affairs of his office as
well as his personal finances with
incredible carelessness and ineffi-
ciency.
But as the committee will no doubt
say, the purpose of a senatorial
investigation is not to pass judg-
ment upon the efficiency of sena-
tors. If that were the purpose, there
would be indescribable confusion
and little gain.

The incompetence of Dodd lay in
the careless handling of his finances,
in the bad choice of members of his
staff and his failure to protect
himself against the reprehensible
conduct of some of his employees.
Whether he conducted his affairs
with efficiency was a matter for the
judgment of the voters of his state
in the light of what could have been
revealed in his campaign for re-
election.
The major issue for the committee
to decide is whether there was
misrepresentation, coming close to
fraud, in the soliciting and use of
contributions, either directly or
through the time-worn method of
testimonial dinners.
I have never known that the
beneficiaries of testimonial dinners
have been in the habit of using such
proceeds for personal use. Nor can I
understand why such proceeds
when used for personal purposes are
not taxable. Certainly, this is some-
thing that the Stennis committee
should clear up. For since that
committee is specifically charged
with setting "standards" of ethical
conduct, it should make clear what
use should be made of such contri-
butions.
The sordid business of the looting

"Urp!"

of Dodd's personal files by dis-
gruntled employees and the handing
over of that material to journalists
for publication cries out for some
sort of censure from the profession
of journalism, if it is in truth a self-
governing profession. Certainly this
sort of thing would be subject to
some sort of action in the legal or
medical profession.
I have been a journalist for 34
years, and I have always regarded
such a means of getting news as
beyond the pale. I know that
hundreds of my colleagues share my
views on the subject. The Supreme
Court has spoken about the methods
of prosecuting and investigatory
agencies in getting evidence.
Protection should extend to the
rifling of anyone's private corre-
spondence and records.
Finally, the entire episode should
call to the high heavens for better
ways of supporting the financial
needs of candidates for public office
than fundraising dinners. They are
nothing less than legalized shake-
downs from people who for the most
part are either expectant of favors
or paying off for past benefits.
How about a strong statement
from the Stennis committee on that
general subject?
