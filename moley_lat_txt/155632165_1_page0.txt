A Purely Racial Defense
of Rep. Powell Is Racism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The controversy over the Adam
Clayton Powell case will have reper-
cussions in the Negro community
and in the nation generally long af-
ter the determination by the House
of his qualifications to sit as a mem-
ber and serve as chairman of the
Education and Labor Committee.
For in his own defense and the ar-
guments of his supporters two ques-
tions were raised which go far be-
yond Powell's personal life and offi-
cial status.
The first question raised was whe-
ther Powell should be punished for
official behavior which in various
degrees has been practiced by other
members and chairmen in the
House of Representatives. It re-
quires no new investigation to show
that some members have abused
their powers and privileges many
times in the past.
Two sorts of practice have been
more or less common. One is the
practice of junkets at public expense
which have little to do with the du-
ties of House members. Some of
these trips abroad have been facili-
tated by the presence in various
countries of what are called "coun-
terpart funds."
☆
This money is in foreign curren-
cies. It belongs to the United States,
but cannot be brought back to the
United States. With few exceptions,
it must be spent in the countries
where it has accumulated. Congress-
men traveling abroad have used
these funds freely, sometimes la-
vishly, and for purposes not specifi-
cally relevant to official business.
The other question raised by
Powell and his defenders and sup-
porters is whether the demand for
disciplinary action was raised be-
cause Powell is a Negro. Powell
brought up this point in his state-
ment. He said that the outcry in the
press and in the House "has not only
been mounted against Adam Clay-
ton Powell but against black politi-
cal leadership, black people and
black progress."
The ostensible reason for the
movement for civil rights has been
that Negroes should be admitted to
a status of equality with white
people. That is what integration
means.
But admission to the national
community means more than a shar-
ing of benefits. It means the accep-
tance of responsibility. And such re-
sponsibility means adherence to the
moral laws, standards and practices
which prevail in our civilization.
That these moral standards have
been violated in the white world
does not mean that Powell and his
defenders are entitled to choose a
low standard of behavior. Responsi-
bility calls for adherence to the nor-
mal standards observed by the great
majority of public servants—con-
gressmen in this case.
If the lower standards which
Powell has cited prevailed general-
ly, our whole governmental struc-
ture would collapse.
In short, Powell or any Negro in
public office must, if there is to be
acceptance of the principle of equali-
ty, be measured against the average,
not the least worthy of his col-
leagues. And enough is known to
make it flagrantly evident that
Powell's behavior has not met nor-
mal standards.
The claim of Negro leaders is that
there should be a single moral stan-
dard. But to defend Powell on the
ground that he is a Negro is to call
not for one but for two standards.
And that actually destroys almost
the whole cast for equality of treat-
ment.
