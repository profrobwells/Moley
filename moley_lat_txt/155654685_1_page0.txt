House Committee System---
Stronghold of Democracy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The lurid fireworks of the Adam
Clayton Powell case have cost the
House of Representatives a great
deal in respect, influence and pres-
tige.
That sovereign American citizen,
called by some the Man in the Street
and by the more cynical Mr. Sap,
will view his representative in the
House as a poor fellow who goes to
Washington with great expectations
and then becomes the creature of
forces beyond his control.
Until the Democratic caucus, sus-
tained by the White House in a pre-
cedent-making outburst of power,
yanked the chair of the Education
and Labor Committee from under
the sprawling haunches of the arro-
gant playboy from the 18th District,
New York, the 30-odd fellow mem-
bers of that committee were mere
names in a book and numbers in a
roll call-when a vote was allowed
by the chair.
Powell hired, used for personal
purposes, played with and ordered
about the committee staff members.
He and he alone decided what bills
were to be cleared for a vote in the
House, made the speaker and/or
President of the United States wait
upon his pleasure-repeat, pleasure
-and decided what millions of
Americans might get in benefits
from their own tax money.
We all have paid dearly for this
bizarre lesson in government. The
power of committees and of chair-
men over committees has existed
from the beginning of the Republic.
The power of chairmen as a part
of the House committee system has
been the inevitable result of the
form of government created under
our Constitution. It is a system pecu-
liar to the United States.
It was a humble graduate student
at Johns Hopkins, the President-to-
be Woodrow Wilson, who first sys-
tematically pointed out for genera-
tions of students the unique nature
of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. That was in his book "Con-
gressional Government," published
82 years ago. Later he summed up
his evaluation of the House in an-
other book, "Constitutional Govern-
ment." Among his comments then
were these:
"The House once debated; now it
does not debate. It has not the time.
There would be too many debaters,
and there are too many subjects to
debate. It is a business body, and it
must get its business done.
"It organizes itself into com-
mittees. . . in order that each piece
of legislative business may be sys-
tematically attended to by a body
small enough to digest and perfect it.
The business of the House is
what its committees choose to make
it."
Wilson, at the time he said that in
1908, did not dwell upon the quite
natural fact that the committees
were to be governed and controlled
by their chairmen. For at that time
the speaker controlled the com-
mittees and the committee chair-
men. In 1910 the power of the speak-
er was reduced. And ever after the
committee chairmen selected by se-
niority have been in control.
In general, committee chairmen
have carried their responsibilities
well. But especially when a chair-
man is experienced, wise and re-
spected he decides what is to be con-
sidered, what is to be done about re-
porting a bill to the House and, in
many cases, what action the House
will take.
I might cite many examples of
this power of chairmen, but one will
suffice. In February, 1937, President
Roosevelt proposed his court-pack-
ing bill. Hatton Sumners, the
shrewd and learned member from
Dallas, was chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.
He opposed the President's bill.
And he simply did not permit his
committee to debate or consider the
bill for six angry months. The Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee had hear-
ings, and after those months the bill
died. But the real credit for killing
the bill was the Democrat from
Texas who defied a President who
the year before had carried 46 states.
Powerful Presidents since have
encountered this hard fact of the
power of chairmen, but the system
stands inviolate. It stands because it
is in the nature of representative
government that it should stand.
and as for my colleague, Adam
Powell, I feel that we should temper
justice with mercy."
