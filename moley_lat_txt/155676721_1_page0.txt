Presidential Primaries---
a Progressivist Mistake
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As hindsight enlightens us in 1967
we realize that the great ferment
called Progressivism (circa 1902-
1914) was a mixture of noble
intentions and witless implementa-
tion. I concede that Progressive
reforms in economic life which
applied the stick to the buttocks of
unbridled capitalism served to re-
mind business leaders of their
responsibility to the public interest.
But Progressivism's political re-
forms were born of the delusion that
people collectively knew more than
their leaders.
The slogan attributed to Robert M.
LaFollette Sr. was "The cure for the
evils of democracy is more democra-
cy." This was as foolish an assump-
tion as Salem's belief that old
women called witches could curdle
farmer's milk or by incantation kill
babies with whooping cough.
I offer, as an example of misbegot-
ten reform, the Presidential prefer-
ence primary.
LaFollette estab-
lished the first one
in Wisconsin in
1905. Since he be-
lieved that both
political parties
were ruled by evil
leaders, his plan
permitted all vo-
ters to give a di-
rective to conven-
tion delegates to
support a chosen
candidate from each party in the
national conventions. It was and is
an open primary in which voters can
cross party lines.
The "Wisconsin idea" was copied
by other states, and by 1914 more
than a dozen states had Presidential
preference primaries.
But after 1914, legislatures gener-
ally were wise enough to realize that
such a process of nomination could
not work, and few changes have
been made in the past half-century.
In 1964 16 states and the District of
Columbia had some variation of the
Presidential preference primary. A
considerable number of primary
states have favorite sons and post
"no vacancy" signs at their borders.
Meanwhile, parties with Pres-
idents eligible for re-election are
free from concern with primaries.
An incumbent President is assured
of renomination if he wants it.
But for aspirants in the opposition
party, the ritual of running in state
primaries is almost imperative.
Even though states still holding
Presidential primaries are in the
minority, the physical and financial
demands of such contacts impose a
rule of selection. For it is scarcely
possible for an aspirant to campaign
in 16 states and after that, if
nominated, to have enough energy
or money to run in the election
campaign.
Some primaries attract aspirants
mainly because there is a supersti-
tion that success there will show
their attraction to voters in all
states. This applies particularly to
the state of New Hampshire.
The reason why the rugged little
New England state rates this pre-
eminence is interesting. It is record-
ed that in 1908 one or more of the
New Hampshire delegates at the
Republican convention violated in-
structions. And so the state adopted
a primary law.
With Yankee thrift, however, the
legislators avoided the expense of a
separate primary election by com-
bining the day of choice with town-
meeting day in early March.
People in New Hampshire are a
cantankerous lot. Those who come
among them making promises and
seeking votes are regarded with
suspicion not unlike that which used
to confront lightning-rod salesmen.
Like as not, they vote against any
such solicitors. And so strange things
have happened in New Hampshire
primaries.
In 1952 Estes Kefauver risked
frostbite by shaking enough hands
to out-vote President Truman. In
the same year Robert A. Taft, up to
then the party's natural choice, was
confronted by war hero Dwight
Eisenhower, managed by a small
group from the Eastern establish-
ment. Taft lost the primary and the
nomination.
In 1964 Sen. Norris Cotton (R-
N.H.), whose political judgment is
not too bright, persuaded Barry
Goldwater to come to his state. The
frosty Yankees rejected him and
also Nelson Rockefeller and voted
for a man on the other side of the
earth who did no campaigning.
Goldwater said publicly that he
wished he had not gone to New
Hampshire. And so I proffer the
advice to all Republican aspirants
for 1968 to skip that primary. I
anticipate that they will disregard
my frail voice and risk all for a very
doubtful prize.
