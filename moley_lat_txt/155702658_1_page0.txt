Nineveh and Tyre Are Being
Joined by the British Empire
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The plan to sell London Bridge is a
sad reminder of the sunset that is
darkening the British Empire. For
that famous structure in the 136
years since it was built has seen, on
the one hand, the majestic flow of
world-wide commerce and, on the
other, the labors of those statesmen
in Whitehall who gave the British
what Kipling called "dominion over
palm and pine."
By coincidence, I have been
reading the Labor government's
White Paper on defense after many
enjoyable evenings with Robert
Blake's "Disraeli" and A. L. Rowse's
history of the Churchills. In one is
the British government's planned
withdrawal of its interests east of
Suez, and in the others, the labors of
great men and a great people
building the most majestic imperial
domain in modern history. From the
formation of the grand alliance by
John Churchill, Duke of Marlbor-
ough in the early 18th century to
Disraeli's proclamation of Victoria
as empress of India, and then in a
short century to a retreat into
isolation.

And so it was a vain boast when
John Churchill's descendant, Win-
ston, said that he had not become
the king's first minister to "preside
over the liquidation of the British
Empire." But it was the war in
which he played so fine a part that
was no doubt the prelude to the
decay.
The government's White Paper
published July 18 substantially an-
nounced a plan for the withdrawal
of British forces in the great life line
to the Far East from Malta to Hong
Kong, the reduction of Her Majes-
ty's contribution to NATO on the
continent, and the deliberate trans-
formation of the Royal Navy to a
defensive posture.
In the long statement of policy
there are assurances that this
change will be "phased" over the
next decade. And occasionally the
government states noble sentiments
of how there will be enough left to
play a part in the defense of Europe
and even contribute to stability in
Southeast Asia. These assurances
are probably included to answer
attacks from the Tory benches and
complaints from the United States.
"Far called, our navies melt
away." Kipling's prophecy in 1897
was not to be fulfilled in his lifetime.
But that is implicit in the White
Paper. The Royal Navy is already in
third place behind the United States
and the U.S.S.R. It will perform "a
valuable peace-keeping function
outside Europe by the unobtrusive
and flexible exercise of maritime
power." The last carriers are to go,
and what is left of the Navy "will
rely upon Royal Air Force land-
based aircraft" for support.
An interesting omission in the
White Paper is any substantial
comment on the Middle East. But
the abandonment of the big base at
Aden was decided upon earlier, and
that leaves the protection of the
Persian Gulf either to the United
States or no one at all.
There will be a complete withdra-
wal of British forces in the South-
east Asian complex by the 1970s by
the progressive reduction of forces
in Singapore and Malaysia. Here,
however, are treaty obligations-
SEATO and the Anglo-Malaysian
defense pact. But, by implication at
least, these obligations will be
passed over to Australia, New
Zealand and the United States.
Of course, the basic reason for this
retrenchment is that the United
Kingdom's economy is not strong
enough to support the social servi-
ces upon which the British people
have become dependent and also to
sustain what it takes to be a major
world power.
And so before our eyes there is the
demise of a once proudly dominant
world power. We
have read in our
history books
about the decline
of great nations,
back to Kipling's
"Ninevah and
Tyre." But this de-
cline has not taken
centuries, as in the
case of Rome. It
has taken place in
two generations-
perhaps since
WW I.
Moley
One is tempted to ponder the
question of what nations still strong
and growing, like the United States
and the U.S.S.R., can learn from
these examples of imperial patholo-
gy. Perhaps Edward Gibbon spent a
lifetime writing the "Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire" as a
didactic enterprise to teach the
British nation how to live a longer
life than most. If so, he failed, for
Rome took centuries for what has
happened to Britain within the
memory of many observers.
We shall see whether the British
economies in military forces will
actually provide enough to create a
prosperous nation. Despite the des-
perate efforts of the Wilson govern-
ment, the economy is not reaching
any degree of stability. Unem-
ployment is mounting, and in July
has set a 27-year high.
