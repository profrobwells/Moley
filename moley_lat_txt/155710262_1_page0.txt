Goldwater Today: Still
a Power in Political Life
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
PHOENIX — Phoenicians, as
people here call themselves, say that
foremost among visitors' questions
are inquiries about Barry Goldwa-
ter. It would be unfair to say that
Goldwater "put Arizona on the
map," for the state's virtues were
known before its favorite son en-
tered the Senate in 1953. But it is
true—that the career of the former
senator has brought more attention
than would millions spent on public
relations.
A newspaperman from here visit-
ing New York wrote this week that
wherever he goes
and makes it
known that he is
from Arizona,
people ask him
"How's Barry?"
and "What is
Goldwater really
like?"
In response to
the first of these
questions, it
should be said that
Goldwater's man-
ner of life is much as it was before
he went to the Senate, except that
he is no longer associated with the
famous family store, which was sold.
But he is in the forefront in helping
with every cause that is beneficial to
his city and state.

So much of the character and
tradition of Arizona are embedded
in the Goldwater personality that
the identification of the man and the
state is inevitable. He is as much a
part of Arizona as Robert A. Taft
was a part of Ohio or as Lyndon
Johnson is rooted in Texas.
Despite his retirement from office,
Goldwater is still the leading politi-
cal figure in the state. One cannot
say that he "dominates" the politics
of the state or even the Republican
Party in the state. For domination
in the usual connotation of the word
can never be associated with
Goldwater. When he speaks of
freedom, as he does so often, he
means not only freedom from
governmental restraints, but from
the tyranny of machine politics.
There are contrasts as well as
parallels among figures in the past
who won identification with the
states that sent them to the Senate.
In sharp contrast was Bronson
Cutting, over the border in New
Mexico. Equipped with abundant
personal means, ambition and skill
in organization, Cutting built a
powerful machine that dominated
his state for many years.

On the other hand, there was
William E. Borah, whose philosophy
was shared by all who served with
him in Idaho as long as he lived. As
Borah loomed high in the nation he
was a source of great pride to every
citizen in his state. That was true of
the relations between Wisconsin
and the LaFollettes. It is so with
Goldwater and Arizona.
Now in 1967 over the nation there
is a reappraisal of Goldwater by the
people, some of them famous pun-
dits, who were led to believe in 1964
that the man from Arizona was a
peril to the republic and who fled in
droves to vote for Lyndon Johnson.
In that year when the President
was not warning his auditors
against "extremism," he was
evoking visions of "peace and pros-
perity."
*
But now there is no peace, and the
President is determined that we
must stand fast in Southeast Asia,
despite opposition in his own party.
Firmness in Vietnam is exactly
what Goldwater was condemned for
in 1964.
Goldwater said in all his crusading
that prosperity comes from a con-
fident free-enterprise system, with a
minimum of managing by govern-
ment. Despite plenty of managing
by the administration, there are
clouds over next year's prospects.
The vast programs of welfare and
subsidies promoted by the President
and obediently enacted into law by
Congress are now enmeshed in
administrative snarls. One member
of the Johnson Cabinet even said
recently that the country is too big
to be governed by a Washington
bureaucracy. That is exactly what
Goldwater meant when he warned
us all about the dangers of centra-
lized government.
In 1965, there was the slogan
"consensus," which was born of the
euphoria follow-
ing the great vic-
tory in 1964. We
haven't heard the
word for a year or
more, for the
Democratic Party
is plagued by
hopeless differences. The voters
blotted out the vi-
sion of "consensus" in the elec-
tions in 1966, and
the President has suffered a serious
decline in the polls.

Theodore H. White was himself
the victim of the euphoria that
prevailed in Washington when his
book "The Making of the President,
1964" was published in 1965. Yet
toward the end of his observations
he wrote a profoundly important
historical truth:
"And yet—and yet, for all this, one
cannot dismiss Goldwater as a man
without meaning in American his-
tory. Again and again in American
history it has happened that the
losers of the Presidency contributed
almost as much to the permanent
tone and dialogue of politics as did
the winners."
