Soviet Ships; Vietnam Supplies
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While Americans may well rejoice
that the Soviet Union's performance
in the Middle East has so far met
with embarrassing frustration, they
should temper their elation by
considering the Russian role in
Vietnam. For without the massive
and continuing Soviet aid to our
enemies there, our military effort
would have been successfully completed
many months ago. Instead, our
forces are meeting ever stronger
resistance, our casualties on land
and in the air are mounting and our
commanders are demanding massive
reinforcements.
Almost every week the dispatches
tell us that some new weapon has
appeared on that bloody scene, and
Hanoi is more confident than ever
that it can win without negotiation.
The decisive factor in the strengthening
of North Vietnam is the stream of
Soviet cargo ships that is pouring
supplies that arm our enemies, kill
our fighting men and bring down our
planes.
Late last year the Applied Physics
Laboratory of the University of
Washington at Seattle published a
most significant and thoroughly
documented survey of Russian
merchant shipping. In the course of
this detailed report, reference is
made to the part played by the
Soviet merchant marine in bringing
war materials to North Vietnam:
"At least 26 Soviet ships have
brought various kinds of material
aid into the ports of Haiphong and
Hanoi in the last year. Some of these
ships have made more than one
appearance. Because of the shallow
draft in the North Vietnamese ports
only fairly small Russian ships have
been used. Most of the ships are dry-
cargo ships ranging from 3,000 to
11,000 gross tons and sailing mainly
from Odessa.
"According to Russian radio
broadcasts the Soviet Union is
supplying North Vietnam all types
of cargo with its merchant fleet.
Such equipment includes coal, fertilizer,
sulphates, oil, marine engines,
machine tools, dump trucks and
lifting cranes of up to 16 tons
capacity. No doubt the Russian aid
via the sea lanes will increase in the
next few months to fill the vacuum
left by ships flying the British flag
which have in the past been the
main carriers in the North Vietnamese
trade."
Following that, the report lists the
names of the Russian ships engaged
in this deadly trade.
Once more, without risking the life
of a single Russian soldier, the
Soviet Union is contributing to our
losses and frustrating our efforts to
save Southeast Asia from Communist
control and to keep open access by
the free world to the Indian Ocean.
The demand of our generals for
reinforcements emphasizes our deficiency
in shipping. Two out of three troops
go by sea, and 98% of material.
The Military Sea Transportation
Service of the Navy has performed
miracles in the past year and can
handle additional troops and their
equipment.
The building of great ports in
South Vietnam has cut the waste that
has characterized the past use of war
shipping. But we have already broken
166 dry-cargo ships out of the mothball
fleet, and we are dangerously near the
bottom of that reserve. It is very costly
to put those old ships into service, and
their history has been one of breakdowns
at sea and long tows to port for
repair. That means delay and upsetting
of plans.
About a third of the ships of the
subsidized lines have been in service
to Vietnam. But that is a loss of the
service in the commerce of the
United States which was envisioned
in the shipping laws.
The Russian ships supplying
Hanoi are only a negligible proportion
of the tremendous new Soviet
merchant marine. It is easy for
Russian shipping to continue to
build trouble in the Middle East and
elsewhere. Meanwhile, we can only
pray we will not be called on to
respond to calls for help, for we may
lack the means to send it.
