Presidential Prestidigitation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We need not wait until Lyndon
Johnson slips into the shadow of
history to begin an appraisal of his
special political genius. (In foreign
policy, he must be judged by events
to come. That is not our concern
here.) Like most intelligent politi-
cians, his private estimate of the
majority of the electorate is colored
by cynicism. He knows how gullible
we are. And his skills are designed
to exploit that weakness.
His method is simple, almost
obvious. He perceives a public
Problem about which many people
are deeply concerned. He is not a
reflective man but a congenital
activist like his revered model,
F.D.R. So he decides to do not one
but several things about the Prob-
lem about which people are worried.
As President, he has many subor-
dinates who have ideas about solv-
ing the Problem. Those ideas are in
infinite variety. It doesn't matter
that some of those ideas, if adopted,
would be in conflict with others, if
adopted. And so he takes a generous
selection of those ideas-panaceas, if
you will-and proposes the assort-
ment as national policy. In announc-
ing the plans he gains something,
for he thus emphasizes that he
knows the Problem, and he forcibly
reminds people that he is going to do
something about it.
I select from a number of examples
the American city-not the people
in the city, but the physical environ-
ment.
Let us consider a 20-year span. In
1948 one program was in effect-
public housing. Then in 1951 anoth-
er program was adopted-slum clear-
ance and urban renewal. By 1957
appropriations were increased for
the two programs already adopted
and three new ones were operating
-urban planning grants, public
facility loans and housing for the
elderly.
President Kennedy also under-
stood the strategy of many pro-
grams for the same Problem, but he
had trouble getting his programs
enacted. Nevertheless, by 1962 three
more urban programs were operat-
ing with small appropriations.
But after L.B.J. became President
the number of programs and the
money spent increased very con-
siderably-14 programs were in
operation in 1967.
All these programs are not costing
a great deal, considering the im-
mense sums needed to rebuild cities.
The total cost of all these programs
in 1967 will be $880 million, which is
nine times what it was in 1948. But
that amount could be lost in any one
of the 10 largest urban centers in the
United States.
The final addition to the list merits
particular attention. That is the
demonstration cities program adopt-
ed in 1966. Since the word "demon-
stration" has another, unpleasant
meaning, the name has now been
changed to "model" cities program.
As proposed by the President, this
was designed to concentrate in a few
cities and with federal money make
them models of what other cities
might copy. This year the President
asked for $662 million for the
program. The House cut this to $237
million, but the Senate voted $537
million.
If we view this as an effort to
provide a model, such a sum as the
President recommended would suf-
fice only to remake a small city of
about 100,000 inhabitants. But with
the smell of federal money in the
air, 70 cities are qualifying for a
slice of the money. Thus, if the
Senate's $537 million is provided,
there would be only about $7.7
million per city. This relatively
small amount would be lost in the
great needs of any major city.
And so it is not a "model city" that
would emerge, but simply another
subsidy for cities where reconstruc-
tion calls for billions.
But the name "model city" sounds
good. Everybody wants a model
city, especially the people who will
live in one. It is an idea that has a
pleasant sound, and in politics that
is all that matters.
