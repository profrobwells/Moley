There is considerable uneasiness
in the business community and
elsewhere about the news that the
Treasury Department is working on
plans to close some of the loopholes
in tax laws and in its administration.
No specific information has been
given out, but it is widely believed
that one of the proposals will be to
implement President Johnson's de-
mand, made in January, for action
to stop "the abuses of tax-exempt
foundations."
If a proposal of that sort is made, it
will have the ardent support of that
perennial reformer, Rep. Wright
Patman. It is characteristic of the
angry old man from West Texas,
however, that his ideas are vastly
more drastic than any President will
propose.
No one should deny that there are,
as Mr. Johnson says, abuses in tax
exemption, and some of them con-
cern so-called foundations. But the
difficulty in narrowing the avenues
to tax exemption is twofold. One is
the tremendous number of such
institutions; the other is the difficul-
ty of defining the meaning of a
foundation.
The Treasury estimates the num-
ber of tax-exempt foundations as
somewhere between 15,000 and 41,-
000, probably nearer the smaller
figure. Patman claims that there are
100,000 and that the assets run into
the billions. Patman's studies,
however, have only covered about
575 of these.
Patman's complaints about foun-
dations seem to center upon these
points:
1—Some foundations own operat-
ing businesses entirely or in large
part. This, he claims, is unfair
competition with tax-paying busi-
ness corporations.
2—The great size in capital and
income of some foundations gives
them a monopolistic position in the
charitable, educational and cultural
fields in which they operate.
3—He objects to perpetual foun-
dations. He would limit their lives to
20 years by requiring them to spend
their capital as well as their income
within that limit.
These suggestions, except in part,
do not reflect Treasury policy. The
Treasury already seeks to have
foundations limit their investments
in operating businesses to a small
minority holding. It may in its new
regulations place that limit at about
20%. This would assure the denial
of control by foundation boards and
officers in any competitive business.
The Treasury, moreover, cannot
limit the size of foundations, for the
true test of control in the social field
is whether there is in fact any
intention to dictate to the beneficia-
ries of foundations.
A limitation on the life of founda-
tions such as Patman suggests
would destroy their major useful-
ness. For it has always been
recognized by the Treasury and by
the foundations themselves that
their value is in their capacity to
plan ahead over many years.
But no one can object to strict
accountability to the Treasury, if
possible on a yearly basis. This can
prevail under existing laws and
regulations and could eliminate
most of the "abuses".
