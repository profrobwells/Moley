Church's Answer to Communism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those pessimists who doubt the
growth of tolerance in the United
States might well consider the years
1928 and 1967. Thirty-nine years ago
there were, no doubt, many thou-
sands who believed the rumor that if
the Democrat. Alfred E. Smith were
elected President, the Pope or his
representative would move into the
White House. A joke went around
after the defeat of Smith that
someone had addressed a one-word
telegram to the Pope: "Unpack."
During the Christmas season in
1967 an American President trav-
eled halfway around the world to
visit the Pope.

While intolerance has so greatly
subsided in the United States and in
other Western nations, the Roman
Catholic Church itself has shown a
remarkable capacity to adjust itself
to new knowledge and new condi-
tions of all sorts.
One such example was in the once
celebrated case of Father Edward
McGlynn of New York City. In 1886
he became pastor of St. Stephen's
Church in a parish on which poverty
and destitution laid a heavy hand.
The compassionate priest, who was
respected for his learning, had read
Henry George's "Progress and
Poverty" shortly after it appeared in
1880. He had also listened to the
impassioned oratory of the famous
reformer.
Inspired by the belief that. George
was correct in asserting that pro-
gress and increasing wealth were
accompanied by more and more
poverty and that the remedy lay in
making land "common property,"
Father McGlynn founded an Anti-
Poverty Society: In his public utter-
ances he went beyond George by
claiming that private ownership of
land was per se sinful.
When George ran for mayor of
New York in 1886, Father McGlynn
was his vociferous supporter. This
undoubtedly greatly irritated Arch-
bishop Michael Corrigan, who
sought to maintain the political
status quo in New York, which in
those days was controlled by the
Democratic machine. He ordered
Father McGlynn to stop speaking
about land reform and appealed to
Rome.
Pope Leo XIII ordered the priest
to present himself in Rome, but
Father McGlynn disobeyed the or-
der. For that he was excommunicat-
ed.
Six years later, however, the Holy
See sent a special representative,
Monsignor Satolli, to New York to
investigate the McGlynn Case.
â˜…
The priest submitted a compre-
hensive statement of his views on
the land question. As a result,
Monsignor Satolli and five other
theologians stated that there was
nothing in the McGlynn philosophy
that was contrary to the Christian
faith and Catholic doctrine. This
was announced officially in 1892,
and the pastor was restored to his
priestly status and his parish.
In the years since then, the Roman
Catholic Church's official doctrine
on land has radically changed. Pius
XII in 1943 and 1944 made it clear
that the common right to possess
land had precedence over private
right of possession. In 1966 the
Vatican Council ranged the Church
on the side of land reform. And
when the United Nations called a
World Land Reform Conference in
Rome, Paul VI entertained the
delegates.
And so, as the world changes, so
does the Roman Catholic Church.
One such change is the growing
realization that the most gripping
problem of emerging is land mono-
poly by a few. The Church recog-
nizes, therefore, that the best an-
swer to communism is land reform.
