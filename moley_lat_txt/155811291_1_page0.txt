U.S. Can Learn 3 Lessons
From Strife in Middle East
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Now that the guns are still in the
Middle East and the long business of
boundaries and rights is under
negotiation, Americans might well
ponder some of the realities we have
witnessed before and during this
brief conflict.
Three of those realities are the
power generated by the Israelis'
love of their homeland, the utter
failure of collective security em-
bodied in the United Nations and
the futility of trying to buy friends
with foreign aid. All of these should
instruct not only Americans gener-
ally, but our government as well.
The Israelis defied the odds,
made a mockery of numerical supe-
riority, ignored the rumblings of the
Soviet Union and realized in time
that "peace keeping" by the United
Nations is an illusion. For with the
first bray of the mountebank Nasser,
U Thant's "army" fled from the
scene.
It is true that the Israelis had the
tools, and the skills and genius to
organize them.
Their generals
knew where and
when to strike.
They knew where
they were going,
how to get there
and what to do
when they arrived. But without
the patriotism
which inspired every man, woman
and child, these
would not have sufficed.
Some who have read our history
might recall that a century and a
half ago we were a new nation with
only a few more thousands of people
than modern Israel. We were sur-
rounded on all sides by predatory
imperial powers. We stood alone,
but with patriotic fervor we not only
defied those powers, but profited by
their mistakes and rivalries.
But in these times it seems that
patriotism has become unfashiona-
ble and self-interest is something
that must be qualified by professions
of altruism. Three months ago I lis-
tened to a speech by Vice President
Humphrey about Vietnam. Only once
did he use the expression "our self-
interest," but he hastened to bury
that slip in a mass of generalities
about what we were doing for
someone else. Perhaps the Israelis
may help us to rediscover some of
our own past.
Our dedication to the concept of
collective security through the
United Nations must be rudely
shaken by the paralysis of the
Security Council throughout this
crisis. Not only did U Thant quail
before the threats of Nasser, but all
he could contribute were reports of
what the belligerents told him. And
Russian Ambassador Fedorenko and
his pals made it clear that the
Security Council is worth only what
they choose to make it. In the last
analysis, the terms of a cease-fire
were determined by the major
powers. They might have done that
had there been no United Nations at
all.

It is true that the "world govern-
ment" on the East River provided in
a time like this a center of communi-
cation. Beyond that, the United
Nations is only what many people
called it when it was createdâ€”a sort
of international town hall, a curious
aggregation of disparate parts.
That debate, however, served us to
realize once more that when the
chips are down some of the nations
upon which we have bestowed
billions in aid are ready to join the
Soviets in misrepresenting our ac-
tions and smearing our motives. The
Indian delegate flatly denied the
formally established American con-
tention that the Gulf of Aqaba was
an international body of water. And
after the war had been won his
boss, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, declared
that Nasser was a "force for prog-
ress" and assailed the United
States for its contention that other
nations must help feed her people.
Whose wheat is it that we have been
sending to India?
Indian "statesmanship" should
realize that India would be one of
the first to lose if the Soviets should
gain a foothold on the Indian Ocean.
India is already the first victim of
Nasser's misuse of the Suez Canal.
Finally, the United States should
use what it has of influence to make
sure that diplomacy will not snatch
from Israel the fruits of its victory.
That is what happened before, for
time proved that promises were not
kept and that assurances were
worthless.
