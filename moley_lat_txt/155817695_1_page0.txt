The Frosty Fruit of Thrift
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If Henry Mencken were alive, he
might find rich material for another
chapter of his sardonic comments on
democracy in New Hampshire's
quadrennial tragicomic presidential
primary. But I, lacking Mencken's
genius, must content myself with a
secital of the facts. You can draw
your own inferences as the show
unfolds over the weeks that lie
ahead.
A long time ago I learned something
about New Hampshire politics
in one of the finest political novels
in the English language: "Coniston,"
published in 1906 and authored by
Winston Churchill, an American
journalist and novelist who at one
time was a member of the New
Hampshire Legislature and also a
candidate for governor in 1912. It is
the story of one Jethro Bass, who
became the boss of the state through
his native shrewdness and by buying
up the notes on mortgaged
farms. Significantly, the book begins
with a quotation from James Russell
Lowell:
"We have been compelled to see
what was weak in democracy as well
as what was strong. We have begun
obscurely to recognize that
popular government is not in itself a
panacea."
★
We should be able to see now, in
1968, not only that this is true, but
that there are defects in the ever
more popular government which
Churchill himself could not foresee
when he wrote his book. For it was
two years after the book appeared
that statesmen in New Hampshire
sought to cure the evils of democracy
by making control ever more
popular.
I had realized for a long time that
the primary system could not produce
better presidential candidates.
This was confirmed when Estes
Kefauver won up there by the mere
exercise of wringing icy hands and
when Robert A. Taft's hopes were
shattered in 1952 in a campaign
engineered by Sherman Adams.
But all the pieces did not fall
together until 1964, when I vainly
tried to persuade Barry Goldwater
to skip the New Hampshire primary.
I was told the story then by an old
friend who in the 1930s was a power
in the Democratic Party in New
Hampshire. He said that for many
years political power in New Hampshire
was exercised by the president
of the Boston & Maine Railroad
from his office in a railway station
in Boston. Then, in 1908, George
Moses, later a famous U.S. senator,
was selected and instructed by the
Republican organization as a delegate
to the national convention.
Moses disobeyed his instructions
and voted for Charles W. Fairbanks
instead of William H. Taft. And so
to prevent such disobedience in the
future, legislators in New Hampshire
adopted the primary system,
which had been born in Wisconsin a
few years before.
★
The legislators were a thrifty lot
and, rather than have the state pay
for a primary later in the year, they
fixed the presidential primary for
Town Meeting Day in early March.
The time for that sacred exercise in
democracy had been fixed so early
because it was a time before the
farmers were occupied in gathering
the rising sap from their trees. But
they were indifferent to what happened
to the contenders (I almost
said "saps") in the presidential
primary, who were thus compelled
to carry their arguments to more or
less indifferent people in the ice and
snow and zero weather.
And so the show, which we are
still witnessing, began. The thrifty
legislators had wrought better than
they had anticipated: since their
primary came first in the nation, the
inquisitive American public sought
in that vote an indication of what is
called a preferential "trend." And
because the eyes and ears of the
nation came to be fixed upon the
campaign up there, a large revenue
poured into the state. The candidates
spend lots of money for
publicity and for the accommodation
of their workers. Hordes of
reporters go to see the show, and
their expenses are paid by the
newspapers and networks.
My old New Hampshire friend told
me that in the pastoral days before
the primary was born, the Boston &
Maine won majorities at the rate of a
dollar a vote. It costs a lot more now,
and the profits add to the state's
economy. But I wonder if the results
are any better than in the benign
despotism of the B&M and Jethro
Bass.
