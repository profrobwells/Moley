Inflation Sprints Across Canada
Spurred by Lag in Productivity
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has not required a visit to Expo
67 to convince me that Canada is in
the grip of an inflation which is
even more serious than we are
experiencing in the United States.
Rather than venturing to endure the
congestion in Montreal, I spent my
vacation in the eastern provinces of
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
Even there one feels the effect of
rising prices.
Students of the economy in Cana-
da are sharply raising the issue of
the cost of living. In August the
Montreal Gazette commented editor-
ially that "inflation in Canada is no
longer creeping; it is sprinting; and
soon it will be running wild."
The Canadian cost of living by
midyear had risen 4.1% since Janua-
ry. That is the latest indication of a
tide which has been rising for some
years. A Canadian dollar saved in
1949 is now worth only 50 cents.
Quite accurately, the Gazette puts
its finger on the basic cause of the
lack of adjustment between money
supply and productive capacity:
"The plain fact is that Canadians
are trying to extract from their
economy more
than they can pro-
vide. They are act-
ing as though they
can take a quart
out of the pint
bottle. But in the
process they are
fooling nobody but
themselves . . .
"It would matter
less, so far as costs
are concerned, if
the productivity of
the country were also going up as
fast, or faster. When all goods or
services are provided more cheaply
by higher productivity, it is possible
to have higher costs without also
having higher prices. But producti-
vity in Canada is not keeping pace
with the demands being made by
Canadians upon their own economy.
Canadians have adopted a policy of
spend now, produce later. The
trouble is that the increased produc-
tivity never seems to come."

It may be of some slight comfort to
Americans who are feeling the
pinch of rising prices to quote what
the governor of the Bank of Canada
told his countrymen in his 1966
report:
"Costs increased more, and pro-
ductivity less, in Canada than in the
United States in 1966. Diverging
movements in costs and productivi-
ty, such as we have seen recently,
cannot go on for long without
seriously affecting the Canadian
economy and in particular its inter-
national competitive position."
The expression quoted above
about taking a quart out of a pint
bottle brings to mind a demonstra-
tion I once saw former Sen. Paul
Douglas make in a television show.
He placed before him an empty
glass. Into it he poured water from a
pitcher until it overflowed onto the
table. The water, he said, is the
money supply, the glass is the
measure of production. When the
measure of production is full, the
money flows over into inflation.
Equilibrium is reached when suf-
ficient goods and services are pro-
duced to stabilize the money supply.
But when money exceeds the supply
of goods and services, prices rise and
the victims are those who have
saved out of their earnings. This
saving is what economists call
"abstinence."

In drawing a parallel between
Canada and the United States, there
must be considered our relatively
great productive capacity. With us,
the rise in production is so great and
so steady that a considerable time
must elapse before the public feels
the effect of rising prices. But in a
period like this, with immense
government costs for the war in
Vietnam, foreign aid and mammoth
social services, the means we use to
get the dollars is to monetize debt.
That is, we run deficits, and more
money is manufactured through the
Federal Reserve System.
With Canadians, a limited produc-
tive capacity more quickly reveals
the onrush of inflation. People's
wants exceed the available supply
and there is, in effect, a bidding for
goods and services. Carried to an
extreme—which neither Canada nor
the United States has yet exper-
ienced—there is a flight from money
into goods. And when people come
to realize the declining value of
their money, catastrophe is the end
result. The key to this phenomenon
is fear; and when fear emerges,
reason falters and there is panic.
