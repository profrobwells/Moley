McCarthy vis-a-vis La Follette
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As Eugene McCarthy carries his
message through the state of Wis-
consin, many an old-timer up there
will draw comparisons-and con-
trasts-with the elder Robert M. La
Follette, who also defied the lead-
ers in his party during most of his
lifetime.
McCarthy is an intellectual of
sorts. His political career was
preceded by years as a teacher and
professor, and he is the author of
two or three books.
La Foliette never taught at the
University of Wisconsin, but he
drew copiously upon the expert
facilities of that institution for his
facts, figures and policies. In his
speeches there was always a con-
siderable display of higher learning.
He could hold an audience of
farmers spellbound for hours while
he diseoursed upon the dairy indus-
try, the sins of railway monopoly or
foreign affairs.
Many of the reforms of the
Progressive era had their origins in
La Follette's Wisconsin. By coin-
cidence, a member of the university
faculty upon whom La Follette
depended was named McCarthy. He
was Charles McCarthy, whose book,
"The Wisconsin Idea," described the
university-inspired reforms in de-
tail. Indeed, the very primary sys-
tem which we now witness in
operation substantially had its ori-
gin with La Follette.
But here the comparison between
the current McCarthy and Old Bob
ends.
The great difference is in temper-
ament and courage. For when La
Follette entered a crusade he put his
whole career on the line and
defended his position with incompa-
rable energy and passion. He excited
while he instructed. He communi-
cated his convictions to everyone
who heard him, and he succeeded in
carrying his state with him to the
end. In 1924, when the Republican
Party was nationally ascendant, he
was not content with merely win-
ning primary votes. He created his
own party and received 5 million
votcs.
When he opposed the war in 1917
he did so with total commitment and
voted against the declaration of war
in the Senate. He carried his
opposition beyond the war into the
fight against entering the League of
Nations.
McCarthy has entered his contest
with the President with a big
qualification. For he has assured the
President and his friends that after
his present crusade is ended with
the nomination of L.B.J. he will
support the President against any
Republican who may be nominated.
This is exactly what. President
Johnson expects from the opposition
in his own party.
Seemingly, McCarthy is not op-
posed to the Vietnamese war per se.
He merely disputes the Johnson
way of bringing it to a conclusion.
And he believes that his campaign is
a sort of academic seminar in which
all avenues of approach will be
quietly voiced and end with a show
of voters' choices for or against the
Johnson policies. And his hopes
extend only to getting enough votes
to induce the Administration to
change its ways.
In presenting his views in New
Hampshire and Wisconsin,
McCarthy excites little response
from his audiences. They wend their
way homeward in the manner of
most Chautauqua audiences which
have been listening to a lecture on
astronomy or art of the Middle Ages.
They are interested, but unmoved.
Perhaps this is why his colleagues in
the Senate who share some of his
Dovish views have flatly denied him
their support. They have lived with
him in the Senate and realize his
total incapacity for forceful leader-
ship.
Thus, his showing in the primaries
is likely to reveal how disorganized
the Johnson opposition really is.
Nothing could please L.B.J. more.
For if there had been no McCarthy
to oppose him, that old pro, the
President, would have had to invent
one.
