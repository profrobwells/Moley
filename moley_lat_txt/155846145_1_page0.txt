Nixon's View About Vietnam
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the Republican Party selects
Richard M. Nixon to oppose Pres-
ident Johnson in 1968, it will have in
its representative a real master of
Asiatic affairs. His knowledge of
that vast area from the Aleutians to
Australia has accumulated over no
less than 13 years.
In 1954, at about the time the
French were being driven from
their colonial possessions in Indochi-
na, Nixon and Adm. Arthur W.
Radford suggested to former Pres-
ident Dwight D. Eisenhower some
American commitment to hold the
line against communism. When this
leaked out to the press there was
considerable dissent. Late in the
1950s Nixon made an extensive visit
to the perimeter of Asia, and in a
public speech in 1958 he suggested a
larger commitment of American
forces.
Since then Nixon has, either by
visits or contacts with Asiatic
leaders, demonstrated a grasp of
what is happening in non-Commu-
nist Asia far greater than anyone
among the leaders in the present
Administration.
After revisiting those countries
this year, he has written his present
observations in a comprehensive
article for the limited readership of
the periodical Foreign Affairs. It
remains now, in the preliminaries to
the GOP convention, to translate his
views into the vernacular of politics.
Nixon says that our presence in
Vietnam already has achieved three
objectives:
1-It has assured the non-Commu-
nist countries on the perimeter of
Eastern Asia from Japan to India
that communism is not necessarily
their wave of the future.
2-We have bought time for them
to develop their own internal
strength and to establish regional
cooperation for mutual security,
common understanding and eco-
nomic intercourse.
3-By the resistance to Commu-
nist aggression in Vietnam, Red
China has been diverted from at-
tacks on other countries in that
great East Asian region.
For the immediate years ahead,
those countries should, because of
their geographical position, form
regional defense pacts to attempt to
contain aggression in their own
areas. Such efforts are mandatory as
an alternative to the direct confron-
tation of the nuclear powers.
Nixon's conclusion is that we
should press our military action
until the Communist threat has
been removed from Southeast Asia.
But looking beyond Vietnam and
taking into account the present
status of the peripheral countries-
Japan, South Korea, Formosa, the
Philippines, South Vietnam, Indone-
sia, Malaya, Australia and India-
Nixon observes nations in a process
of transformation.
They are realizing that commu-
nism's promise for their future
would be like Red China today, the
reign of flat, sterile conformity.
The Southeast Asia Treaty Orga-
nization has not succeeded because
it was imposed from without. Its
successor must be a real cooperative
sphere of its own making.
So far as American interests in the
Western Pacific are concerned, the
present facts as well as our own
history are compelling considera-
tions. It might be said that our
future role as a major Pacific power
was thrust upon us when Japan
struck at Pearl Harbor.
Moreover, the necessity for de-
fense required a two-ocean U.S.
Navy, now the greatest seapower in
the world. This pertains to our self-
interest as well as to our formal
commitments which cannot be for-
saken.
As Nixon may well cite in
describing the century-old policy of
the Republican Party, our manifest
destiny is a great national interest in
the Pacific. It was exactly 100 years
ago that Secretary of State William
Seward acquired Alaska as Ameri-
can territory. Every notable Repub-
lican statesman since then has
supported or affirmed or extended
American interests in the Pacific.
Thus Nixon, rather than the GOP
Doves who reject a defense of
Vietnam, is really in the "main-
stream" of the Republican tradition.
