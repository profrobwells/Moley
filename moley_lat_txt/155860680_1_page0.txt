The Durable Dean Rusk Has
Finally Come Into His Own
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the first year of the Kennedy
Administration I wrote a piece
saying that Dean Rusk had little
option but to resign as secretary of
state. We writing people do that sort
of thing. It makes us sound brave
and informed in the ways of
government. It doesn't affect our
own jobs, and the people in govern-
ment reject our advice (if they ever
even read it) and don't resign.
I made the suggestion because in
the dim past I had myself spent six
unhappy months in the State De-
partment. I learned then and later
what a trial it is for a secretary of
state when a President sets up an
apparatus in the White House to
advise him on foreign policy and
thus to by-pass his official adviser,
the secretary.
Rusk, of course, did not resign.
But after Lyndon Johnson became
President and John Kennedy's little
group of personal foreign secretaries
was sent packing, the patient and
durable Rusk came into his own and
now after seven difficult years
should be ranked among the fore-
most secretaries of state in our time.
Kennedy because by experience and
intellectual equipment he deserved
the office. But Mr. Kennedy immedi-
ately created a sort of kitchen
foreign office in the White House
composed of men who in no way
matched Rusk's competence and
who, as we now know from their
post-assassination babbling, ma-
nifested contempt for Rusk and his
department.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., one of that
crew, spends many pages in his book
"A Thousand Days" on contemp-
tuous comments upon Rusk. His
undisguised bias leads him into a
grave contradiction. He criticizes
Rusk because, as he tells the story,
Rusk failed forcibly to express his
views when there was a foreign-
policy huddle at the White House,
and, while Schlesinger concedes
that Rusk was a superb technician,
he never came up with new ideas.
*
But since, as in such conferences,
it is probably true that Schlesinger
did most of the talking, Rusk felt
that silence was his best course. And
since all new ideas were generated
at the White House, Rusk was fully
occupied in trying to implement
them. It may be added that some of
the new ideas were also bad ideas.
Among the other ordeals endured
by Rusk in those 1,000 Kennedy
days was the President's habit of
dumping many political liabilities
into the State Department. Among
these were four lame-duck ex-
governors for whom some sort of
work had to be found.
When Lyndon Johnson became
President, he found Rusk to be
ideally agreeable to his sort of
government. For Rusk had created a
smoothly operating State Depart-
ment after its many years of neglect.
Mr. Johnson also had reason to
respect his secretary because Rusk's
knowledge and literacy enabled him
to formulate his policies and cogent-
ly express them. In confronting Mr.
Johnson's critics in the Senate, Rusk
proved that he could overwhelm
them with his background under-
standing of the facts.
*
But a much deeper, emotional tie
bound Rusk and President Johnson
together. They had been regarded as
alien bodies introduced into the
happy circle of Camelot. Rusk and
L.B.J. had been viewed with disdain
in the Kennedy world. And when
the new President assumed office
they recognized their kinship.
Since then, Rusk's qualities have
had excellent exposure to the coun-
try. As one writer has put it, he is a
quiet man who projects great au-
thority. He is "doughty, hard-bitten,
gritty." And as a lifelong student of
history he grasps not only the role of
the United States as it is recorded in
the past, but the threat imposed by
Communist expansion. He knows
something of the reality in the life
and death of nations.
A Man for All Seasons

Thr relations between Presidents
and their secretaries of state provide
an interesting footnote in history. In
some instances Presidents have had
the wisdom to appoint strong and
knowledgeable men and have per-
mitted them to dominate foreign
policy. Benjamin Harrison had
James G. Blaine. William McKinley,
after two mistakes, appointed John
Hay and gave the reins to him. T. R.
had Elihu Root, Warren Harding
gave full support and control to
Charles Evans Hughes, and Dwight
Eisenhower selected John Foster
Dulles.
Woodrow Wilson, on the other
hand, assumed full direction him-
self, had two resignations—one
forced—and ended with a compliant
subordinate. F.D.R. selected Cordell
Hull because he wanted to make all
the big decisions himself.
