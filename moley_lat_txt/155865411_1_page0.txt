They're Legislating Inflation...!
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Perhaps the name and jurisdiction
of the House committee had some-
thing to do with the monstrous
hybrid it created, for the Committee
on Post Office and Civil Service used
to be the Committee on Post Office
and Post Roads. And so now, instead
of looking after the postal service
alone, it is the place where pay
raises for the entire 2 million-plus
bureaucracy are generated.
The spread of its jurisdiction,
however, did not compel the com-
mittee to join into one bill increases
in postal rates, raises in pay for
postal employes and a general hike
in compensation for all civil em-
ployes of the government except the
2.700 employes of the antipoverty
agency. Brazen political interest
prompted that. The consequence is a
powerful stimulant to inflation in
the whole economy.
★
Earlier this year the committee
had two bills—one (HR 7977) which
incorporated increases in postal
rates for all classes of mail and the
other (HR 8261) for federal salary
increases. But while the President
had asked for postal rates that
would reduce the Post Office deficit,
he was opposed flatly to the pay
raises for all employes because the
proposed increases were beyond
certain guidelines he had specified.
So, to avoid a veto of the pay raises,
they were included in the postal-
rates bill.
This change was made on Sept. 19,
and the whole bill was reported two
days later. On Oct. 11 the House
passed the package. A large majori-
ty of both Democrats and Republi-
cans voted for it. And so it goes to
the Senate. In short, the House now
passes the buck to the Senate and
the President.
While the increases in mail rates
are considerable, the raises in pay of
postal workers alone will about
equal them, and the Post Office still
will be running a deficit of about $1
billion.
The general pay raise will amount
to $2.6 billion when fully effective.
But the inflationary effect of higher
postal rates will be reflected in price
increases by businesses to match
their mailing costs. Thus, it is
estimated that the inflationary
thrust will be about $3.5 billion.
The congressional demands on the
President for cuts in spending
before a tax increase is voted seem
quite hollow when this action of the
House is considered. For it is
Congress that is the great barrier
against any real reduction in spend-
ing.
The postal rate increases are
highly discriminatory. First-class
rates go up 20%; air mail 25%;
second-class 21%, and third-class
32%. In addition to the 21% on
second-class mail, an amendment
was added to impose a surcharge on
magazines and newspapers that
mail more than 500,000 copies.

In the House debate a great deal
was said about "junk" mail, which is
a contemptuous characterization of
matter posted as third-class mail.
But as some congressmen pointed
out, this class of mail is the lifeblood
of many small businesses and all
periodicals of small circulation, for
their major means of selling their
product is through direct-mail ad-
vertising.
In addition, third-class mail has
deferred delivery. This permits the
Post Office Department to keep
clerks and carriers fully occupied in
time that would be idle if only first-
and second-class mail were handled.
The basis of the discriminatory
raise in second-and third-class mail
is an accounting system which even
the House committee discounted as
an accurate measure of how much of
the Post Office deficit should be
assigned to each class of mail. For
no accounting system has been
devised yet to allocate costs to each
class. The same facilities are used
for all.
Thus, the fires of inflation are fed
by the very congressmen who are
crying out against the President's
spending.
