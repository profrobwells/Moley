Report on Civil Disorders
Spurs Wallace's Growth
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
William S. White is correct when
he says that the most obvious
beneficiary of the report of the
President's Commission on Civil
Disorders will be George Wallace.
For every riot between now and the
election will provoke a reaction
among the whole population, from
which Wallace will profit in the
North and West. And the social
engineers who contributed the bulk
of the report certainly have given
encouragement to black leaders who
ignite the flames of civil strife. As
Richard Nixon says, the report
blames everyone for the riots except
the people who directly created
them.
That Wallace already should be
reckoned as a decisive factor in the
1968 election is a fact which seems
to be missed by nearly everyone
who speculates upon the outcome.
On trips to the South over the past
two years political leaders and
editors there have told me of the
Wallace potential. Within the past
two weeks I was told by a keen
observer from Tennessee that if the
elections were held today in Tennes-
see the result would be Wallace
first, Nixon second and President
Johnson third.

Since then I have sought the
opinion of Republican chairmen in
the deep South. They tell me that
Wallace is growing stronger every
day. These people also say that if
Rockefeller were the candidate the
effect would be a catastrophic blow
to the growing Republican Party in
the great area which once comprised
the Confederacy.
Since Wallace seems likely to be
on the ballot in most states in the
Midwest and West, he would take a
considerable slice from both Mr.
Johnson and the Republican candi-
date.
Wallace has already campaigned
in various places from Pennsylvania
to California, and the nature of his
support is becoming more and more
clear. He attracts extremists of the
Birch type by dwelling upon their
shibboleths: communism, federal
bureaucracy, "intellectuals," "long
hairs and short skirts." In riot-
ridden cities he is against crime and
violence. He speaks no racism, but
the implication is clear.
Wallace is highly articulate in his
sympathy for blue-collar workers
and thus he makes big inroads into
the ranks of white nationality
groups, especially if their origins are
Polish, Hungarian or Italian. For
they fear that more jobs for Negroes
mean fewer jobs for them. Thus,
since those groups are traditionally
Democratic, the loss would be Mr.
Johnson's. Presumably Wallace's
affinity in suburban areas for right-
wing extremists would mean losses
for a Republican candidate there.
Much of this reaction is, against
President Johnson and the domin-
ant party in Congress. And Wallace
is an accomplished hunter in
tangled woods and swamps. He has
neither the flair nor the intelligence
of Huey Long, but he reaches more
deeply into the business community.
His conservatism is completely
phony. Except on the issue of civil
rights, his paternalism is not unlike
Mr. Johnson's. He objects to a
national welfare state but, judging
from his record in Alabama, his
vision is of 50 small welfare states.
In a close contest between Nixon
and Mr. Johnson, the Wallace
capture of 50 or more electoral votes
in the South might well throw the
election into the House of Represen-
tatives. In that event, unless the
Republicans can make considerable
gains in the congressional districts,
Mr. Johnson would win even with a
minority of the popular vote.
A somber element needs to be
mentioned: Gov. Lurleen Wallace's
dangerous illness. If her illness
continues, Wallace's campaign
would lack momentum, for he would
draw criticism for leaving her side
to campaign over a nation. That is
no minor factor for his considera-
tion.
