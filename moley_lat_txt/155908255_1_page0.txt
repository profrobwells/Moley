Amendments to the Social Securi-
ty system are coming out of a
House-Senate conference commit-
tee, will be passed by both houses
and will be signed by the President.
Under the law the benefits now paid
to 20-odd million people will rise
sharply and progressively over a
period of years. The annual tax
return from employers and younger
employes will also rise over the
years from the aggregate of about
$25.7 billion paid in 1967.
But while the old folks will rejoice
over this holiday news, there is
bound to be rising concern among
the several times as many people
who will be paying for their elders'
security and, ultimately, their own.
There will also be rising concern
among employers who have to find
the matching money in their earn-
ings.
Under the present law, the maxi-
mum Social Security bite from each
worker's pay is $290 annually. Un-
der the new law, at the beginning
it will be somewhere between $334
(House bill) and $352 (Senate bill).
By 1987 it will rise to between $448
and $626.
I am not concerned in this piece
with the general question of the
rights and wrongs of the Social
Security system. I shall have some-
thing to say about that later. But
here I wish to raise a question that
has had altogether too little atten-
tion in the past except among
responsible employers. Specifically,
this is the danger to all private
pension plans in the rising costs of
Social Security.
This was the subject of a very
thoughtful address recently by
Robert C. Tyson, chairman of the
finance committee of the U.S. Steel
Corp. and also, during the past three
years, chairman of the Tax Founda-
tion. His warning was that because
of the large bite out of earnings
taken by the government in Social
Security taxes there will be less
available for benefits and savings
paid by workers and/or companies,
such as life and medical insurance,
sickness and unemployment bene-
fits, as well as pensions and annui-
ties.
Tyson devoted his major attention
to company-managed pension plans.
For these plans are endangered not
only by the increasing burden of
Social Security taxes, but by contin-
uous efforts by government to
investigate and regulate such plans,
sometimes amounting to downright
harassment.
There are many advantages in the
private pension plans that are not
present in Social Security, although
Tyson and probably all members of
management in companies that have
them assume not only the perma-
nence but also the desirability of
continuing the government's plan.
Their argument is that in such a
dual security system the private
part should not be jeopardized by
the government.
Some of the advantages are that
they are a part of an enlightened
system of free enterprise, that they
are voluntary in the sense that they
come from the desires of the
workers themselves. They are more
flexible than the monolithic Social
Security system. Their reserves are
invested in wealth-and job-produc-
ing enterprises. And they are work-
related, with every employe able to
see them as an equity against the
needs of his retirement.
Whatever endangers them in the
rising costs of Social Security is a
threat to the security of every
worker who now enjoys them.
