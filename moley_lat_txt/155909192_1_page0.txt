Do the Presidential Primaries
Really Have Any Importance?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After the bones of absent neigh-
bors have been thoroughly stripped,
the drying course of conversation
can be augmented by the questions:
"What about all these presidential
primaries? Are they really very
important? What are they for and
what do they do? How did we ever
come to have primaries if we still
have conventions?"
These questions could also be used
by teachers who want to bring to
their students a bit of lively concern
with the news of the day.
The answer to these questions and
many more about the strange way
that this "cradle of liberty" creates
Presidents is told in one of the most
interesting publications of the cur-
rent season. It is a brochure titled
"Parties, Politics and the Pursuit of
the Presidency." It was prepared by
the Free Society Assn.
Perhaps the most startling fact
brought out in this study is that
with the number of real and pseudo-
candidates who enter presidential
primaries and the loose language of
convention he won four to one.
In only six primary states are
delegates legally instructed to vote
for the winning candidates: in four
others they are instructed only if
they run "pledged" to a particular
candidate. In the remaining states,
primary elections are merely "advi-
sory" popularity polls and delegates
may, and often do, disregard the
voters' advice or they pick unin-
structed delegates.
Even in the states where primaries
are binding, delegates may be
instructed to vote for "favorite
sons."
Not all candidates enter all prima-
ries. This would probably be physi-
cally impossible because of the
ardors of campaigning. In only three
states-Wisconsin, Nebraska and
Oregon-are all talked-about con-
tenders put on the ballot. Staying
out of these contests requires an
oath disclaiming presidential ambi-
tion, but in only two of these-
Wisconsin and Oregon-are the
primary results binding on the
delegates.

If Richard Nixon won all the
primaries he has entered, he would
be guaranteed only 96 legally in-
structed delegates at the convention.
He would still need 571 more to be
nominated.
On the Democratic side the maxi-
mum number of instructed dele-
gates Robert Kennedy could round
up through the primaries he has
entered is 298. Should Eugene
McCarthy win all the primaries he
has entered he would control 566
Democratic delegates, less than half
the number he would need to get the
nomination. And if Hubert Hum-
phrey entered the race at this time
he could win only 14 instructed
delegates through primaries.
It is easy to get too captivated by
primaries while ignoring the key
decision in a majority of states
where party precincts, wards and
townships elect delegates to county
conventions who elect delegates to
district and state conventions who,
in turn, elect delegates to the
national convention.

the laws it is conceivable that these
primaries can really bind only 48 of
the 667 Republican delegates needed
to nominate a candidate at Miami,
and only 94 of the 1,312 Democratic
candidates needed to nominate a
candidate at Chicago.
Since this is true, one might ask
what the hullabaloo is all about.
The melancholy answer is that
politics in what we call a democracy
is after all mostly hullabaloo. Or to
give the process a nicer designation,
the primaries are "psychologically
important." For to a large degree
politics is largely seeming, not
being.
In 1952, Sen. Estes Kefauver in his
coon-skin cap was wonderful in the
primaries, but Adlai Stevenson got
the nomination without entering
any primaries. In 1956, primaries
were of no consequence. In 1960,
John F. Kennedy won some prima-
ries, but organized effort plus father
Joe's money did the most. And in
1964, Barry Goldwater's primary
record was mixed, but at the
