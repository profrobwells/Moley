The convulsions that are so shak-
ing what we choose to call our
American civilization have finally
revealed the essential inconsistency
in what only a decade or two ago
was called "liberalism." For the
modern "liberal," unlike the liberal
of a century ago, favors a greatly
expanded, centralized authority but
at the same time he loosely sustains
all forms of personal freedom under
the Bill of Rights. This conveniently
overlooks the necessity that there
must be civil order if there is to be
any freedom for the individual.
Indeed, the distinction between
liberty and freedom should be very
clear: liberty is something ordered
and limited by authority; freedom,
unlimited, is lawless license.
The bitter harvest of that incon-
sistency is what we are facing today.
Our Constitution sought effective-
ly to reconcile civil order and
personal liberty. For it is at once a
charter of liberty and a pattern of
public order and security.
One of the modern liberals who
with age and maturity is now
seeking to recover that constitution-
al balance is the venerable Justice
Hugo Black.
As a senator before his 1937
appointment to the Supreme Court,
he was a howling scourge of big
business. And for many years he
adhered, sometimes in the majority
and sometimes in the minority, to
those earlier prejudices. But more
recently the flavor and implications
of his opinions have revealed a
considerable change in outlook. This
change he has documented in three
lectures at the Columbia University
law school as late as March, 1968.
In what he said there he gently
reminded the court that its govern-
mental function is to interpret
rather than to make laws. For he
said, "The Founders wrote into our
Constitution their unending fear of
granting too much power to judges."
On two points especially he has
disagreed with recent decisions of
the court. One is the habit of
applying the rule of "reasonable-
ness" to laws of Congress or the
states. Here he believes that the
court, by applying its own idea of
reasonableness, is rejecting the right
of legislators to be guided by their
own ideas of reason.
He also rejects the court practice
in recent years to create a new right
of "privacy." He said in his lectures
that since no such right is guaran-
teed by the Constitution the court
has no power to create it. He now
says that in the interest of public
security an individual's privacy may
be invaded by various forms of
police eavesdropping.
The issue in these days is not only
the right of free speech but the
effect of such talk in promoting
illegal or violent action. Here Black
moves very cautiously because of
his earlier views as a judge. On the
one hand he says that he believes
with Jefferson that "it is time
enough for government to step in to
regulate people when they do some-
thing, not when they say some-
thing."
He has held in the past that
Congress has no power to prevent
people, even Communists, from
talking about public affairs, "wheth-
er or not such discussion incites to
action, legal or illegal."
But despite these earlier opinions
the connection between speech and
action seems to trouble the justice.
True, the First Amendment prev-
ents Congress from any act restrict-
ing "the right of the people peaceab-
ly to assemble," and so forth. But
Black now realizes that the word
"peaceably" directs governments to
make sure that such assembling
shall in truth be peaceful and
orderly. And there the "new" Hugo
Black is very forceful:
"Our government envisions a sys-
tem under which its policies are the
result of reasoned decisions made by
public officials chosen in the ways
the laws provide. Those laws do not
provide that elected officials, coun-
cilmen, mayors, judges, governors,
sheriffs or legislators will act in
response to the peremptory de-
mands of the leaders of tramping,
singing, shouting, angry groups
controlled by men who, among their
virtues, have the ordinary amount
of competing ambitions common to
nankind.
"A control by such particularized
groups is directly antagonistic to a
control by the people's representa-
tives chosen by them to manage
public affairs. In other words,
government by clamorous and de-
manding groups is very far removed
from government by the people's
choice at the ballot box.
"What we have in this country is a
government of law, designed to
achieve justice to all, in the most
orderly fashion possible, and with-
out leaving behind a deluge of hate-
breeding divisions and dangerous
riots."
