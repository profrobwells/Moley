Erosion of Fabric of Order
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While so much of the Western
world pauses to observe the comme-
moration of the birth of Jesus
Christ, a bit of reflection might be
given to the relationship between
the individual and the state in
which he lives.
That is a political question, a
question which is sharply raised in
current discontents in the United
States. For the state is being
challenged by countless individuals
and groups.
Centuries before the birth of
Christ, the individual had struggled
for what he conceived to be recog-
nized rights. Confucius, four centu-
ries earlier, taught that "within the
four seas all men are brothers."

The Athenians under Pericles
struggled for their ideal of liberty
against neighbors who held a quite
different concept of the nature of
the state. In his funeral oration
Pericles underlined the principle
that political institutions rested
upon the character of the people and
that all individual liberty rested
upon the education and wisdom of
those who enjoyed that liberty.
The articulate Greeks sought to
rationalize that principle. Plato, who
was born two years after the death
of Pericles, veered from a belief in
individual liberty to the view that
the state should be supreme—a state
ruled, incidentally, by philosopher
kings.
Aristotle broke from Platonism in
his definition of "happiness," which,
he said, was "the good we are
seeking." But in his listing of the
things that constituted "happiness"
the implication is clear that the
individual should choose for him-
self. This concept of "happiness"
was Thomas Jefferson's guide in
writing the Declaration of Indepen-
dence. "Happiness" is the goal, but
the virtue lies in the right to seek it.
Without the contribution of Chris-
tian teaching, much of the laborious-
ly reasoned equalitarianism taught
by the Greeks and later by some
Roman philosophers and lawmakers
might have been lost. For neither by
science, which could never hope to
prove the basic equality of indivi-
duals, nor by rational conclusions,
which would find little understand-
ing in an age of illiteracy which
prevailed for more than a thousand
years, could the primacy of the
individual hope to survive.
But the simple concept of a
brotherhood of all men, with a
common destiny and a oneness with
God, could become the bedrock on
which later enlightenment could
rest. Most important was the con-
cept of the immortality of the soul.
It became the major foundation of
the individual's significance.
It remained for later ages to
incorporate the constitutional and
legal guarantees of individual
rights, created by the collective ac-
tion of individuals, which might be
enforced through the agency of the
state. For without the state, indivi-
dual rights and public order could
not be maintained.
Public order and personal safety
can exist only under a constitutional
system. In that system the state,
represented by its government, has
the delegated authority to protect
and conserve the liberties of every
individual while assuring peaceful
relations among all.
Those who defy the law or
encourage others to defy the law on
the pretext of "civil disobedience"
are projecting themselves beyond
the bounds of reason. They are
eroding the very fabric of the order
under which they enjoy the right to
protest.
