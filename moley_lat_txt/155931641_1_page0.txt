The Sea Power Argument Is
Strong Vietnam War Backing
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Any educated naval officer can
give you a better reason for Ameri-
can presence in Vietnam than we
have yet heard from President
Johnson, Vice President Humphrey
or any of the other candidates. For
our real responsibility in this war
centers upon what is known as sea
power. This has been taught in our
Navy ever since Alfred Thayer
Mahan wrote his great classic on the
subject in 1890.
British governments have under-
stood the meaning of sea power for
nearly two centuries. Every chal-
lenge to British supremacy on the
seas-by the Dutch, the French, by
Germany and Japan-has been fol-
lowed by war. For national survival
in all that time rested upon the
power of the British navy.
Freedom of the seas is not assured
by international law or international
agreements or the Charter of the
United Nations. It is guaranteed
only when one nation, hopefully a
freedom-loving nation, has the naval
power to enforce it.
Britain's role on the sea began its
decline after World War I because
of an impoverished economy and the
progressive liquidation of its em-
pire. The takeover by the United
States of the responsibility formerly
imposed upon Britain began with
the Washington Conference in 1921
when we assumed naval parity with
the United Kingdom. World War II
finalized the change, when the
United States emerged with incom-
parably the most powerful navy in
the world.
In the years since 1945 British
governments have further reduced
their commitments. The final with-
drawal will be Britain's retreat from
the Indian Ocean. That vast area
bordering on many of the countries
of Asia, the Middle East, Africa,
Australia and New Zealand lies
exposed to the threat of Soviet
command through Russia's new and
growing fleet.
The vital peninsula of Southeast
Asia dominates an entrance to that
great southern ocean. There the
Strait of Malacca, giving access from
the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, is
one of the four major channels
connecting the seas of the world.
What makes it so vital that
communism should not dominate
that peninsula was a fateful turn in
the cold war during the 1950s. After
the death of Stalin, Soviet leader-
ship decided that Russia should
break out of its traditional land-
locked isolation and become a sea
power. At first the Soviet govern-
ment set itself to build an immense
merchant marine as a means of
projecting Communist influence in-
to the far reaches of the world. In a
single year, 1966, it added more
modern merchant ships than the
United States produced in the
preceding five years.
A merchant fleet and a navy are
interdependent. The first naval
ships of the Soviet were mainly for
defense purposes: These included
many submarines, and also warships
that were deployed in the Mediter-
ranean this year.
But now there are indications that
heavier warships are either planned
or being built. Recently the U.S.
carrier Enterprise clocked a Russian
nuclear submarine whose speed
prompted the planning of a new
breed of U.S. submarines.
As an indication that the Russians
are planning to make the Indian
Ocean a playground for their ships
is their pressure upon India to al-
low the building of a sea base there.
Three of our Presidents would
have clearly stated the reason why
we should not permit Communist
domination of Southeast Asia. Cer-
tainly the two Roosevelts under-
stood the meaning of sea power. And
I venture to say that had John F.
Kennedy lived, he, too, would have
known the implications of this war.
The reasons given by this Admi-
nistration for our involvement are
our treaty obligations, our duty to
keep a small nation free from
aggression and our concern for other
free nations in the Western Pacific.
These are commendable objectives,
but the real issue is the maintenance
of the freedom of the seas.
Our responsibility for maintaining
freedom of the seacoasts was not
deliberately sought. Our size, our
resources and our long seacoast
have thrust this destiny upon us.
The decision must be made whether
we are to have freedom of the seas
on Communist terms or on our own.
