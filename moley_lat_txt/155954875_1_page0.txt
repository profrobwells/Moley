Is the GOP a Minority Party?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his campaign for the nomina-
tion, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller has
constantly claimed that the GOP is a
minority party. The figures used
show that Republicans are only 27%
of the electorate.
That was George Gallup's figure
based upon a sample of eligible
voters. Gallup's most recent sam-
pling shows that 46% claimed to be
Democrats, 27% "independents" and
27% Republicans.
Thus while Rockefeller concedes
that Richard Nixon is the preference
of Republicans, he claims that he
would get more "Democratic and
independent" votes.

That alleged low percentage of
Republicans is refuted by the actual
voting statistics in recent elections.
But before we come to these hard
facts let us consider the Gallup-
Rockefeller figure. Gallup's sample
is based not upon the actual voting
population, but upon those eligible
to vote, and here, of course, is the
glaring weakness of all polls.
For in midyear elections consider-
ably less than one-half of the
eligibles vote and in a presidential
election only about 62 or 63% take
the trouble to go to the polls. And no
pollster can determine how many of
those whom his samples purport-
edly represent will vote at any
election.
In 1966 about 55 million people
voted; in 1964 70 million voted for
the major candidates; in 1960 slight-
ly over 68 million voted, and the
eligibles must number something
like 125 million. Another element
that must be considered is that
many people in the relatively high
economic and educational levels like
to consider themselves "indepen-
dent." It is a good and comfortable
word to use to describe oneself. It
has the same appeal that the
cigarette people used for their
product: "For men who think for
themselves."
But in a showdown most of these
will vote Republican. But in the
polls Rockefeller must have discov-
ered that Nixon outvoted him
among "independents."
But let us consider the relative
strength of the two parties in the
last general election-1966. The best
way to judge that is by the number
who voted for members of the House
of Representatives. By actual count
in those elections the Republicans
polled 25,524,000. The Democrats
polled 26,907,000. There were also
441,000 votes for "others." The
percentages compiled by the Repub-
lican Congressional Committee were
48.3% and 50.9%.
But in considering these figures
we must always make allowance for
the fact that the Democrats did not
contest four districts in 1966 and the
Republicans did not run in 52
districts. So that if we consider the
number of Republicans in those 52
uncontested districts who were de-
nied a chance to vote for a candidate
of their party, and also the Demo-
crats of the four districts in which
they had no candidate, the actual
strength of the two parties is
practically equal.
*
I have secured a good estimate of
the number of Republicans who
were without a choice in the 52
districts. It was 1,250,000 and the
Democrats in the four uncontested
Republican districts were 125,000. If
we accept these estimates, then the
Republican vote in 1966 was 26,774,-
000 and the Democratic vote was
27,025,000.
When we consider Rockefeller's
claim that Nixon's vote will be
substantially limited to 27% of the
electorate, let us look at the vote in
1930 when John Kennedy and Nixon
each had about 34 million. And the
vote in 1968 will be substantially
higher than that, perhaps for both
candidates, because of the increase
in the number of eligibles who will
vote. The campaign in 1968 will then
start with two parties fairly evenly
matched.
