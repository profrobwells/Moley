A Few Good Words for Spiro T. Agnew
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Experience has taught me that the
worst place to view the impact of a
national campaign is from an office
in New York or Washington. It is
like attempting to enjoy the majesty
and beauty of a mountain range
from a cabin on the foggy bottom of
a valley.
It is true that here in New York
our news services duly report from
here and there over the country.
And this is supplemented by the
pictures of the far-flung battle on
our television screens.
But even with these sources our
judgment is blurred by the bias of
the local papers and our contacts
with friends who all take impres-
sions from these same newspapers
and other media.
To get away from such distrac-
tions this year I left New York five
weeks ago and after a motor trip of
7,000 miles, through 16 states, I
returned last week. This trip gave
impressions that were sharply chal-
lenged by what comment is current
here in New York.
I am concerned here only with
what people think of Spiro T.
Agnew as a candidate for Vice
President. Here in New York and in
Washington, required reading in the
morning are newspapers which
have centered their criticisms upon
Agnew. Nixon, who is more difficult
to attack, is charged with "his
greatest blunder" in choosing Ag-
new.

He is regarded elsewhere as a
good, solid American—a man who in
his own state of Maryland did a good
job of governing and who greets his
audience with the sort of talk that
people like to hear this year.
One of the unusual facts about the
campaign this year is an almost
morbid concern about the life of a
President. The assassination of Pres-
ident Kennedy and the accession of
Lyndon B. Johnson—who is now
blamed for everything, including
much he had nothing to do with—
has made people acutely aware of
the importance of the man who is
"one heartbeat away." This feeling
has been sharpened by the tragic
ends of Robert Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr.
I have never, in all the campaigns
I have witnessed, known of this
concern before. In a question-and-
answer session upon my return,
with a group of young Republicans,
this concern received a good airing.
"Would Agnew make a good Pres-
ident?"
Who knows? What we do know is
that eight of our 35 Presidents have
entered the White House after the
death of a President. The country
survived all these changes and in
the four recent instances the accl-
dental President was subsequently
elected in his own right.
The attacks on Agnew for two
small slips show the lack of sub-
stance behind the claim that he is
unworthy. There was a hullabaloo
about his calling a reporter a "Jap."
That certainly couldn't offend any
American voters except in Hawaii.
And the Polish vote certainly is not
lost by his use of the expression
"Polack." The King, Hamlet's fath-
er: "He smote the sledded Polacks
on the ice." A scholar at Stanford
University who is of Polish origin
told me that in Poland itself the
word is used with no disrespect. It is
applied to the Poles in the province
of Bialystok. Perhaps since Agnew
never participated in a presidential
campaign before he doesn't realize
that on such occasions everybody
loses his sense of humor.
Since in this year both candidates
for President boast that they are
self-made men, I certainly feel
Agnew fits the picture.
Agnew is not the sort who
suggests that a brave new world is
just around the corner. He admits
that his sort of doctrine does not fit
the pattern of the New Politics.
"When we win," he says, "we are
just liable to bring back into
American life a lot of things that the
devotees of the so-called 'New
Politics' consider dull. Dull things
like patriotism. Dull things like
incentive. Dull things like a respect
for law and a concern for a greater
justice for all Americans . . . And
some of the fellows hanging around
the street corner might want to go to
work again just to block out the
boredom from their lives."
Let's face it. He is what in modern,
smart idiom is called a "square." But
an awful lot of the people who are
going to vote next week are
"square" and are not ashamed of it.
They have had their fill of the smart
stuff. They have come to realize that
the "new economics" is just a name
for living beyond our means. And
they have seen that "participatory
democracy" ends in anarchy. They
want some of the old verities to
stabilize the momentum of a new
technological age.
