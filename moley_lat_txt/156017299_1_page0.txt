Our Captive Presidents
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a scene in his play, "Abraham
Lincoln," John Drinkwater shows
the President resting after a day
spent visiting the troops at the
front. He is lounging in a chair with
his feet in another chair. Over his
long legs there is an Army blanket.
His voung secretary. John Hav. is
reading from Shakespeare's "The
Tempest" the comments of Prospero
about the show of magic which he
has just given his guests. At the end
of the recital, Lincoln repeats the
lines:
"We are of such stuff as dreams are
made on,
And our little life is rounded with
a sleep."
Lincoln, no doubt, realized what a
captive he was in the role of
President. But it was the genius of
the playwright that associated it
with the fantasy produced by Pros-
pero.
Shakespeare more than once re-
ferred to life as a stage where each
man played a part assigned to him
by fate or circumstance. He would
have understood the meaning of
Drinkwater's use of the quotation.
There is nothing like a national
convention which reminds us so
much of the flight from reality which
characterizes our political life. And
of how a candidate or a President is
governed by the part he must play.
That was the sum of my reflec-
tions after four days at Miami
Beach.
The externals were all contrived
make-believe. The mass of "litera-
ture" and gimcracks worth no more
than it was when laborers gathered
and burned it after the show was
over. The claques of hired hands
who know nothing of the matter
except the few dollars their efforts
earned. The useless free loaders and
camp followers who always infest a
convention with nothing on their
minds except an appetite to see a
show.
The reckless violation of the truth
by contenders and their managers.
Expressions, in this instance, about
the nonelectability of Richard Nixon
which they will deny when they
campaign for him later on. The
speeches, a cascade of cliches and
platitudes. The tireless repetition of
meaningless polls. The long sus-
pense and the final count of hard
votes.
*
But there are rules and customs
which lie beneath all this mad
disorder. Rules determined by self-
interest mingled with reason and
deep concern for the nation as well
as the party. The delegates who
have seen it all before are not moved
by the show. Most had their mind
made up long before they came to
the convention.
Presidents are created in this
strange setting, and while, as a
foreigner observed long ago, not all
have been great men, with rare
exceptions all have been honorable
and true to the role in which they
have been cast.
Nixon emerged from all this as the
choice of a great party. For more
than a score of years he has traveled
the highways of politics. No one
knows so well the fleeting moments
of glory bought by enduring frustra-
tions and defeats. And he knows
that as a candidate in the next three
months he must still be playing the
part he has so well enacted in the
months and years before. And if
elected President, there is still a role
to play.
Never again, if he is successful in
November and/or January, will he
be the private person of the past
except in the enclave of his family.
The Dick Nixon his friends have
always known must be "Mr. Pres-
ident" then. They must meet him
amid the reticence v'hich will sur-
round the great office he will hold.
*
His words will be weighed in the
scale of the vast influence they will
have in the corners of the nation and
the world. His decisions will shake
nations, including his own. He will
be tightly confined for security's
sake in all his comings and goings.
He will be ruled as much by custom
and prudence as are the royal
prisoners in Buckingham Palace.
Why should anyone seek such a
transformation in one's life? Why
should one scorn the delights of
freedom in such a role?
There are no sure answers to such
wonderings. We can only know that
such has been the lot of all the
others who have held that great
office. If he is elected, it will be
decreed by his ordination.
