The presidential campaign this
year will be distinguished by an
extraordinary fact. For the major
issue will be something about which
neither the President nor the Con-
gress can do much.
That issue will be law and order,
safety in the streets, moral stan-
dards, integrity and efficiency in
public office. But the administration
of criminal justice, except in a few
minor categories, is not a legal
function of the federal government.
About all that the President and
Congress can do is to provide
subsidies for police training in the
streets and cities, permit the FBI to
provide information from its files
about criminals and criminal sub-
version, and in great emergencies
send in federal troops when request-
ed by a governor.
Indirectly, the Congress can help
by providing subsidies for better
housing and urban reconstruction in
areas where crime thrives. But that
is about all that can be done from
Washington. The real job falls upon
state and local authority.
But a President, because of his
great office and his great prom-
inence, has, as Woodrow Wilson
once said, "the ear of the nation."
His influence is incalculable, and if
he has the will and the capacity he
can set moral standards for the
public opinion and public pressures
in behalf of a more orderly society.
Sixty years ago in a series of
lectures at Columbia University,
Woodrow Wilson, then president of
Princeton University, delivered a
famous paper on the presidency in
which he dwelt upon the President
as "the voice of the nation."
It is pertinent to consider what
Wilson said on that historic occa-
sion:
"For he (the President) is also the
political leader of the nation, or has
it in his choice to be. The nation as a
whole has chosen him and is
conscious that it has no other
political spokesman. He is the only
national voice in affairs. Let him
once win the admiration and con-
fidence of the country, and no other
single force can withstand him, no
combination of forces will easily
overpower him. His position takes
the imagination of the country.
*
"He is the representative of no
constituency, but of the whole
people. When he speaks in his true
character, he speaks for no special
interest. If he rightly interprets the
national thought and boldly insists
upon it, he is irresistible and the
country never feels the zest of action
so much as when its President is of
such insight and caliber. Its instinct
is for unified action, and it craves a
single leader.
"It is for this reason that it will
often prefer to choose a man rather
than a party. A President whom it
trusts cannot only lead it, but form
it to his own views.
"It is the exceptional isolation
imposed upon the President by our
system that makes the character
and opportunity of his office so
extraordinary. In him are centered
both opinion and party. He may
stand, if he will, a little outside
party and insist as it were upon the
general opinion. It is with the
instinctive feeling that it is upon
occasion such a man that the
country wants that nominating con-
ventions will often nominate men
who are not their acknowledged
leaders, but only such men as the
country would like to see lead both
its parties.
*
"The President may also, if he
will, stand within the party counsels
and use the advantage of his power
and personal force to control its
actual programs. He may be both
the leader of his party and the
leader of the nation, or he may be
one or the other. If he leads the
nation, his party can hardly resist
him. His office is anything he has
the sagacity and the force to make
it."
This statement should be consid-
ered by everyone who votes in
November. For we are electing not
just the executive head of a stupen-
dous establishment. It is our respon-
sibility to choose the man best
suited to shape the moral standards
of the nation.
