Agnew and the 'Flynn Rule'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No doubt Richard Nixon, in
choosing Gov. Spiro Agnew as his
companion on the Republican ticket,
was following a rule laid down by
the late Edward J. Flynn in 1944.
Flynn, long master of the Bronx and
in 1940 the Democratic national
chairman, was Franklin Roosevelt's
closest and most astute political
mentor. Scarcely a matter of political
strategy was decided by Mr.
Roosevelt when he did not abide by
Flynn's advice.
In 1944 Flynn's influence denied
Henry Wallace a place on the
national ticket. Then when President
Roosevelt suggested James F.
Byrnes as a substitute, Flynn vehemently
objected. He said that with a
Southerner and a former Catholic on
the ticket, he, Flynn, could not carry
New York for F.D.R.
The President then asked for
another name. Flynn, as he explained
later in his book, "You're the
Boss," and as he told me personally
at that time, said:
"No candidate for Vice President
will bring votes to the ticket. Take
the man who will lose you the
fewest."
And so the choice went to a little-
known senator named Harry S
Truman. History clearly proves the
validity of Flynn's rule. Look back,
if you will, over the long list of vice
presidential candidates, and it will
become clear that only one of them
really added to the ticket. The only
exception which proves the rule was
in 1960 when John Kennedy chose
Lyndon Johnson.
I discussed this subject with
Richard Nixon in 1959 and he fully
agreed with the Flynn rule. At that
time his choice for his vice presidential
running mate was Gerald Ford,
a little-known congressman from
Michigan. But at the last moment
President Eisenhower and former
President Hoover swayed his choice
to Henry Cabot Lodge. True to
Flynn's rule, Lodge lost to the ticket;
thousands of votes by his blunders
and indifferent campaigning.
It is clear that Nixon in choosing
Agnew was moved by the Flynn
rule. If Charles Percy, Mark Hatfield
or John Lindsay had been his
choice, he would lose practically
every state east of the Mississippi
and south of the Mason-Dixon line to
George Wallace.

I have visited the South twice in
the past four months and have
talked with several Republican leaders
in that area. They have worked
hard to build a Republican Party in
the old Confederacy. They have
brought hundreds of thousands of
traditional Democrats into the GOP.
They have elected several congress-
men, one governor and in Georgia
they nearly elected another. They
have many candidates this year for
local offices. They have a senator in
Tennessee and a converted one in
South Carolina.
And west of the Mississippi they
have a governor in Arkansas and a
senator in Texas. They have reached
the point where there is a real two-
party system in the South. This is
the first time the Republican Party
has been a truly national organization
since the Civil War.
But this chance of building a
national party in all 50 states would
have been shattered if Lindsay,
Percy or Hatfield had been chosen,
for, with any of these on the ticket,
Wallace might well carry the whole
southern part of the country.
Moreover, Agnew has assets on his
own account. His base is not
essentially in a ghetto-dominated
central city. It is in suburban
Baltimore County, where he established
his political reputation. And
the Republican emphasis this year
must rest largely in these areas with
a middle-income population which
lies beyond the cities' limits. His
personal background is unimpeachable.
He has been a progressive
governor. And as everyone who
witnessed his performance on the
platform knows, he is a solid,
appealing speaker.
Liberal-oriented commentators are
echoing Democratic hopes when
they lament the choice of Agnew.
They would do well to realize that
the real threat to Nixon is Wallace,
not Humphrey.
