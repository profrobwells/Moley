How to Restructure the GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The meeting between President-
elect Nixon and Republican Nation-
al Committee Chairman Ray Bliss
on Jan. 10 was far from a mere
routine affair. For their amicable
discussion of the role of the Republi-
can organization should play during
the coming years and the announce-
ment by the President-to-be that he
wanted Bliss to remain in his
present post should put a stop to
persistent rumors since the election
that Mr. Nixon wanted to supplant
Chairman Bliss with someone who
would more glamorously preach the
virtues of the new Administration in
speeches and public statements.
These rumors I am sure emanated
from people who coveted the Bliss
job.
It seems to be true that Nixon
believed that, in the situation in
which he will find himself as
President, he himself cannot be too
partisan a spokesman because he
will need the support of a Congress
controlled by Democrats. Nor can
the Republican congressional lead-
ers speak for anyone except their
legislative supporters. For that rea-
son he feels that there should be
someone who can speak for the
Republican Party as a whole.

But the President-elect also rea-
lized that the GOP National Com-
mittee must be headed by a man
who will maintain and strengthen
the party in the states and localities
in anticipation of the elections in
1970 and 1972.
Thus it is suggested that two quite
different functions must be carried
out if the Republican Party is to
have a major role in governing the
country in the years to come. One is
that of a sort of evangelist; the other
the work of a manager. Unquestion-
ably Bliss fits the latter role. He
has no desire to be a spokesman.
In the past, national chairmen of
both parties have tried to perform
both functions. And since most
chairmen have been part-time work-
ers, neither job has been done very
well, at least in the years since Will
Hays was GOP chairman 50 years
ago.
An excellent suggestion has been
made to resolve the problem faced
by the President and his party: use
the Republican Coordinating Com-
mittee through its chairman as the
voice of the party.
Its members include all former
Republican presidential candidates
who are still living: Goldwater,
Nixon, Eisenhower, Dewey and
Landon; six officers of the National
Committee; all of the official mem-
bers of the congressional leadership;
a number of Republican governors
selected by the GOP Governors
Assn., and a representative of the
Republican State Legislators Assn.
Since its creation the coordinating
committee chairman has been the
national chairman, Ray Bliss.

The suggestion is that this Co-
ordinating Committee be somewhat
restructured with a party spokes-
man at its head who should be
selected by the new President with
the assent of Bliss. This man would
have an executive director whose
duty would be to maintain contin-
uous contact with the Nixon Admin-
istration where, to a great degree,
party policy would be created.
Bliss would remain as chairman of
the National Committee and while
carrying on the normal activities of
the office he should somewhat
restructure his organization by ap-
pointing a number of regional direc-
tors on a full-time, paid basis. At
present, the special problems of the
party, especially in the fast-growing
South, need more direct attention
than is possible from Washington.
And as the 1968 campaign indicated,
party organizations need streng-
thening in many states, especially in
the Northeast.
It is almost irrelevant to speak of a
Republican or a Democratic Party
as if they were monolithic struc-
tures. They are both made up of
many semi-independent units and
many unrelated units. There are
party congressional leaders, the
national administration, the gover-
nors, the state and local party
organizations and the state legisla-
tures. Theoretically, the national
committees represent the only
means of cementing all of these
assorted units.
The plan I have outlined above
would provide the cohesion and
cooperation essential for the success
of at least one of the two national
parties.
