Is U.S. Ready to Lend an Ear
to Nixon's 'Forgotten' People?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
James Reston, serving as always
as the cat's whiskers for New York
Times' readers, comments about
Richard Nixon's appeal in his accep-
tance speech to the "forgotten"
people. These are, as Nixon de-
scribed them, those Americans who
don't complain but whose industry
and effort provide for those that do.
Reston's perception is correct. For
these "forgotten" people are the
ones who presumably will vote for
Nixon. But Reston's collateral com-
ments are far from correct. It is true
that Nixon's use of the word
"forgotten" has its political origin in
Franklin D. Roosevelt's "forgotten
man" in 1932. That man was
impoverished then but he and his
like are in the more prosperous
ranges now.

But they have not risen to better
conditions now, as Reston implies,
by the ministrations of the federal
government. Their well-being has
come from the vast productive
power of free enterprise.
Reston also says that Roosevelt's
early New Deal succeeded despite
the opposition of the Republican
Party. The Emergency Banking Act
of 1933, which rescued the banks
and broke the back of the Depres-
sion, was written under the direc-
tion of a Hoover appointee and
holdover, Arthur Ballantine. The
Republican leadership in Congress
vigorously supported the act and
later, despite Roosevelt's doubts, a
Republican, Arthur Vandenburg,
introduced legislation for the gua-
rantee of bank deposits. And Van-
denburg's protege, Gerald Ford, is
now Republican leader in the
House.
The concept of Roosevelt's "for-
gotten man," as well as Nixon's
"forgotten" people, was in an essay
by Yale Prof. William Graham
Sumner, written in 1883. In his
famous essay Sumner said: "Now
who is the Forgotten Man? The
Forgotten Man is delving away in
patient industry, supporting his
family, paying his taxes, casting his
vote, supporting the church and the
school, reading his newspaper, and
cheering for the politician of his
admiration; but he is the only one
for whom there is no provision in
the great scramble and the big
divide...He works, he votes,
generally he prays-but he always
pays-yes, above all he pays. He
keeps production going on...He is
strongly patriotic...He gives no
trouble...He excites no admira-
tion...He is not in any way a hero
...or a problem...nor notorious
...nor an object of sentiment...
nor a burden...nor the object of a
job...nor one over whom sen-
timental economists and statesmen
can parade their fine sentiments...
Therefore he is forgotten."
Nixon's definition is exactly what
Sumner had in mind. He said: "It is
the voice of the great majority of
Americans, the forgotten Ameri-
cans, the nondemonstrators, that are
not racists or sick, that are not
guilty of the crime that plagues the
land. They are black, they are white,
they are native born and foreign
born, they are young and old, they
work in America's factories, they
run America's business, they serve
in government, they provide most of
the soldiers who died to keep us
free.
"They give drive to the spirit of
America, they give lift to the
American dream, they give steel to
the backbone of America, they are
good people, they are decent people,
they work and they save and they
pay their taxes and they care. Like
Theodore Roosevelt, they know that
this country will not be a good place
for any of us to live in unless it is a
good place for all of us to live in."

Unlike Reston, who uses the
expression "middle class," I chose
the words "middle interests" in two
books, one of which appeared 16
years ago. I rejected the word
"class" because it conveys a concept
abhorrent in America's cherished
classless society. The word "class" is
consistently used in British socialis-
tic jargon and is the central point of
Marxian dialectic.
Our society is not stratified, nor
sick, nor unjust. And it is the
"middle interests" that provide the
great bulwark against radical
change. An Irishman, Sean O'F'ac-
lain, puts it this way: "Between
England and revolution there will
always be an army of bowler hats."
The reality of the great center can
be defined not only in material
terms but in moral, spiritual and
cultural values.
