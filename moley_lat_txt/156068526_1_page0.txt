Rich Public Servants
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Jesus said that it was
"easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven," it is recorded that his
disciples "wondered very much."
And a good many people, including
some U.S. senators, have been
wondering since.
There is no reliable data about the
people who have entered heaven but
we do know that a great many rich
men have been trying to by whatever
means they have. However, when
a rich man agrees to serve in high
public office, his problems are much
more complicated. These center
upon the concept of "conflict of
interest."
He must not only submit himself
to vigorous inquisitions while in
office by congressional committees
and by the press, but before he is
confirmed he must not only disclose
his private financial affairs but his
ideas and philosophy about matters
concerning his job. Also, if there
seems to be any possibility of
conflict of interest between his
private property and the public
good (as interpreted by individual
senators), he must also remove
personal control over his own
property.
The Senate has never been very
specific about how it should apply
the laws and rules in these matters.
For certain self-evident truths present
themselves. Very often the
public and the private interest can
both be served in the same transaction.
The late Charles Wilson when
he was chosen to be secretary of
defense in 1953 said in effect that
what was good for General Motors
could be good for the United States
and vice versa. This was quite true,
but it caused a great commotion.
Going back some years for another
precedent, President Harding was
alleged to have said when he named
Andrew Mellon to be secretary of
the Treasury that since Mellon had
plenty of money he surely would not
be tempted to steal from the
taxpayers. But under constant scrutiny
from the press Mellon seems to
have been a good public servant. He
reduced the public debt more than
any other secretary in this century.
And he was continued in office by
two successors of Harding. The stain
that was cast upon the memory of
Harding was by two of the relatively
poor members of his Cabinet.
The conclusion one must have
reached during the period when the
Senate was considering the men
whom Mr. Nixon had chosen for
Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions
was that while these interrogations
and disclosures may not guarantee
that there will be no favoritism,
they serve useful purposes. They
provide for a curious public information
about the people who will
serve it. And the Senate's approval
of them provides a certain insurance
against the attacks later on by the
muckrakers in the press and in
Congress.
Walter Hickel's troubles seem to
have been rooted in a number of
circumstances. First, there was his
indiscretion in revealing his views
about conservation. These views
were not at all unreasonable. For
despite the excessive zeal of conservationists
it does make sense to
oppose miserly hoarding of so many
resources by the government.
While his personal record was not
responsibly questioned, his interests
did involve many of the controversial
affairs which are inherent in
Alaska. Alaska is the least developed
of our states and is also
probably among the richest in
natural resources. The United States
owns 95% of its vast area, and most
of the custody of this comes within
the jurisdiction of the Interior
Department.
But since so many other concerns
of that department lie in states
remote from Alaska, the concentration
of Hickel's interests in his home
state may be a handicap in managing
these other matters. It is no
reflection upon the integrity or
patriotism of Hickel to suggest that
the President might have made a
more fortunate selection.
While complete dedication to the
public interest should be exacted of
all who serve in government, an
equally important qualification is
competence. Waste, not pelf, is the
more important price which the
taxpayers must pay for incompetence
in public office. For every
dollar paid in even "honest" graft,
millions are lost through incompetent
administration. Every one of
the 12 big departments should have
at its head a man of proved success
in his private affairs.
And a most important test of such
competence is what he has accumulated.
The rich should, therefore, not
be barred from public service merely
because they are rich.
