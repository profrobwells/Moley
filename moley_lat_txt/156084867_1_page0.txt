Taiwan's Model Land Reform
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In April of this year the Republic
of China will celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the flight of its
president, Chiang Kai-shek, with his
army and other faithful followers
from Mainland China to the province
of Taiwan. But as a successor
of President Sun Yat-sen, he also
brought with him the ideas and
plans of that great reformer.
After its arrival, and assured of
national security by American sea
power and with American economic
aid, the new government began the
work of shaping the policies of a
new nation.
Taiwan, which still regards itself
as a province of China, during the
many years of Japanese occupation
served mainly as a rice and cane-
sugar bowl which exported much of
its produce to Japan. The development
of industry was not encouraged.
And aside from a source of
raw materials, it served as a
Japanese naval and air base. This
was what the Republic of China
inherited after the peace of 1945.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, during his exile in
Western countries after the abortive
revolution in 1895, was greatly
influenced by the concepts of land
reform of Henry George and John
Stuart Mill. When he returned in
1911 and became president of China,
he sought to apply what he called
the "equalization of land rights." In
the constitution of the new nation
on Taiwan, these concepts are
spelled out.
Then the Chiang Kai-shek government
proceeded to implement these
principles step by step. Rent was
reduced from 70% of the cash crop
to 37.5%. With what the farmer
retained, he was able to pay for his
land in yearly installments. In a few
years 300,000 farmers were able to
own their own land. The government's
publicly owned land, taken
over from colonial Japan, and what
was left in the hands of landlords,
gradually moved into the possession
of the people who tilled it at a price
of roughly 2.5 times the value of an
annual crop.
The government's purchase of the
holdings of the landlords was aided
by U.S. loans administered by the
American Security Mission and a
Chinese-American Joint Commission
on Rural Reconstruction.
According to Karl Brandt of the
Hoover Institution of Stanford, who
was a member of President Eisenhower's
Council of Economic Advisers, the
loss to the landlords by this
transfer has been more than repaid,
since the economic growth of the
nation has offered them greater
opportunities outside of agriculture.
Brandt's summation is this:
"This achieved agrarian reform
represents a challenge to all those
leaders in developing countries who
have been toying with vague ideas
of reform:
*
1—The redistribution of land has
fortified the peoples' faith in the
institution of property in land and
in guaranteed freedom of management
of this resource. Avoidance of
confiscation and payment of indemnity
to the expropriated part of the
land, combined with the general
uplift of the economy and the
disappearance of conflict between
landlords and tenants, have contributed
to a feeling of assurance.
2—The new owners have actually
paid off within the period of 10
years the entire debt to the Land
Bank of Taiwan, thus closing the
chapter on agrarian reform.
3—Instead of a reduction of
agricultural output that has invariably
followed agrarian reform in
other countries, the case of Taiwan
proves that it is possible to avoid
such damage if appropriate opportunities
are opened to farmers and if
incentives are present."
C. K. Yen, vice president of the
Republic, said a year ago that as a
result of the reforms 86% of the
farm population has become owners
of 90% of the productive land in
Taiwan.
The prosperity of Taiwan is shown
not only by expanding exports and
industrial growth but by its influence
in other developing countries. For
example, it has 450 of its
experts serving as advisers in 19
African countries. This greatly exceeds
the influence of Red China in
that area. Taiwan is even making
monetary grants to some of these
countries.
But even greater is the influence
of its example in the nations of Asia
from Iran to Japan.
