President Nixon's visit to the
various federal departments and his
little speeches to workers employed
in the countless offices bordering on
the endless corridors were something
more than routine matters.
As an old Washington hand, he realizes
well that if he is to succeed he
must be known and be seen by
those workers. If possible, he must
be admired or at least respected.
For the bureaucracy can mar if not
unmake any Administration. Presidents
come and go, but the bureaucracy
has eternal life.
But this President can never know
or even see all of the 3 million
civilian employes who are working
for him. Some—a great many—
thousands live and work in the
District of Columbia and its environs,
a multitude is scattered in the
states and more than ever are
abroad. They are collectively the
bureaucracy, and their number has
grown prodigiously in the past few
years.
When F.D.R. was inaugurated,
there were 603,000 civilian employes.
In 1940 the New Deal had increased
the number to 1.042 million. The
war years added 2 million. Under
the Truman regime the number fell
to 2.558 million. And while President
Eisenhower tried hard to cut back, he
only succeeded in reducing the number
by less than 200,000.
When President Kennedy took
over, there were 2.398 million, but
during the eight years that followed,
the number increased nearly twice as
fast as it did in the first eight
Roosevelt years.
These people toil and they spin
and try to follow often confusing
orders. They get little note in the
vast flow of news from Washington.
Their prosaic labors are overshadowed
by the President, his official and
personal family. The heads of the
big departments get their pictures
printed everywhere. And talk of
issues and new programs blacks out
the people who must, in their own
favorite word, "implement" these
congressional and presidential directives.
They really know little more of
what goes on at the top than we do
out here in private life.
This Administration is new only in
the fact that a few people have been
skimmed off the top and others have
taken their places. So far as you and
I are concerned, our contacts with
the government we call ours, and
which we pay for, are the same.
One of the new group of academic
men who have taken office in the
new Administration said after he had
tasted a few days of life in the
bureaucracy: "The more things
change, the more they remain the
same," which freely interpreted
means that the new Nixon people
are only the front window. The
people in charge of the store are the
same as before.
And that is an inexorable fact.
Someone must send you your Social
Security check every month.
Someone must send the farmer his
subsidy, and someone must send or
give a food stamp to someone who is
hungry and needs something to eat.
And, of course, someone must dun
you for your next income tax
payment.
In the interregnum that followed
the election, the Nixon people made
heroic efforts to get people to fill the
few jobs which lie outside civil
service. One Nixon zealot sent
letters to thousands of people selected
from "Who's Who," asking for the
names of suitable people. This
operation produced little. Many who
received these letters thought it was
a practical joke.
And so the new regime started
with only about 100 new people in
rather high-level jobs—100 chiefs
and 3 million Indians.
Balzac, in one of his brilliant
flashes of understanding about the
French government after Napoleon,
said of the bureaucracy: "That
ponderous curtain that is set between
the good that needs to be done and
the man who can command it."
But in our country and in our
time, can "that man" really command
it?
In other transitions and under
other new Presidents there were
numerous instances in which a
President has taken a personal
interest in placing someone in an
obscure corner of the bureaucracy.
He has even written a personal note
about it. But someone far down
those endless corridors found a
reason in the law or in the budget
why it could not be done. And the
expectant beneficiary went his way
and the busy President forgot all
about it.
We cannot live without this
bureaucracy. It is the President and
his department heads' problem to
learn to live with it. To say that a
new Administration is in control is
to speak in relative terms.
