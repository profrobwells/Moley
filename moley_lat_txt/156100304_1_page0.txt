In 1953, shortly after the Eisen-
hower Administration took over, I
called on Douglas McKay, the new
Secretary of the Interior. I had called
at his office more than once when he
was governor of Oregon.
A smallish, quiet man, he sat at an
enormous desk in the suite con-
structed by a predecessor, Harold
Ickes, in the 1930s. Ickes, despite his
zeal in soaking the rich, loved
comfort and caused to be built in the
Interior Building a large, luxurious
suite for his personal use. It consist-
ed of a sumptuous office, a dining
room, kitchen and bedroom (or
rooms) and all the appurtenances.
Down the long corridor outside
McKay's office was the new under-
secretary of the department, Ralph
Tudor, and also the full complement
of assistant secretaries of the depart-
ment. All of these were presidential
appointments.
*
Tudor was a distinguished civil
engineer and a graduate of the U.S.
Military Academy. Ultimately, he
was made a colonel in the Engineer
Corps.
After two years of wrestling with
the vast bureaucracy of the Interior
Department, he resigned and re-
turned to private practice. At that
time he wrote a magazine article
commenting upon his experience.
He said that McKay had asked the
Civil Service Commission for 350
"exempt" jobs, meaning personal
appointments. The commission gave
him 75, which, as Tudor said, was
not enough to establish clear control
of the department from the top.
There were then about 60,000
civilian employes in Interior. In the
McKay administration in four years
this number was reduced by some
thousands but since that time it has
risen to 77,534. And so, in that
department alone, which had been
filled by Ickes' appointees over a
period of long years, the working
staff was, in the main, unsympathe-
tic with the policies and ideals of the
new Administration. Possibly, some
of the older employes are still Ickes'
men and women or are other people
who were hired during the Roose-
velt years.
That illustrates the situation
which Richard M. Nixon and his
department heads will face after
January. There were in January of
this year 3,026,376 civilian employes
working for the federal government.
Of these, 1,310,608 civilian employes
are in the Defense Department, a
good many of whom have been
employed since the war in Vietnam
has expanded.
Some of these bureaucrats live and
work in the Washington area. Most
are scattered all over the nation and
a considerable number are abroad.
Big contingents of these are in
headquarters hundreds and even
thousands of miles from the top
department heads. The secretaries
of agriculture, interior or treasury
will probably never see these remote
people or the places where they
work.
The power of the President and his
department and agency heads to
appoint new people loyal to the new
Administration is limited by the
Civil Service Commission and con-
gressional action. There is a Civil
Service "Category C" which num-
bers something like 5,000. These are
"exempt" positions. But most of
them are stenographers, chauffeurs
and other minor employes. The
actual power of the President and
his policy-making heads is limited to
a free choice of the appointment of
only about 2,000 more important
positions.
Even assuming that the young
men who are working on these
appointments during this interreg-
num are able to get loyal and
competent people to fill this handful
of positions, there will be very
limited control over the vast num-
bers who must be held over.
*
When new men are installed they
will have to get the necessary
information from the holdovers, and
that information may be colored by
the policies and loyalties established
in past Democratic administrations.
Once installed in office, the top,
Nixon appointees will find it hard
going when they try to replace any
of these permanent people. For
there are hundreds of examples in
which a department or bureau head
has found it easier to keep the
disloyal and incompetent rather
than go through the endless rigma-
role which has been established for
their "protection." Therefore, mis-
fits must be shuffled around or
perhaps transferred to another de-
partment when they should be
replaced by a new appointee.
And any attempt by the President-
elect to change these rules will be
met with howls by reformers that he
intends to establish a spoils system.
Thus we may have business as usual
throughout the bureaucracy, per-
haps for years to come.
