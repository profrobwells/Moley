Aiding Poor Is Noble, but
Does It Elect Presidents?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is tragic irony that Lyndon
Johnson's preoccupation with the
needy and underprivileged should
be the greatest mistake in the career
of that superpolitician. History may
give him high marks for his moral
choices. But it has been his fate to
preside over this country in a time
when the people he has tried to help
have so little political potential and
withal even these few seem now so
reluctant to reward him with their
gratitude.
His most notable activities in the
domestic scene have been directed
toward the central cities with their
ghettos and their problems of decay,
air and water pollution and their
unhappy people. The voting power
in those areas has been steadily
declining. The people who may well
elect his successor are in the
suburbs, the areas beyond the
suburbs, the small towns and on the
farms.
He and his protege Hubert Hum-
phrey have a good record in helping
the black minority. But minorities
don't elect Presidents.

And while they are firmly holding
the support of big-union leaders, the
time has come when the dues-
paying members of those unions
have moved up among the more
affluent in our society and they are
more likely to vote against the
preferences of their union leaders.
Major voting power is now held by
the fairly well-to-do middle inter-
ests. A report recently issued by the
U.S. Bureau of the Census lists the
distribution by incomes of the 56
million people who voted in 1966. Of
these, 39 million or 68% had
incomes of $5,000 or more. Only 24%
had incomes of less than $5,000 and
7% did not record incomes. Even if
we add the latter to the low-income
group, the lower-income people are
outnumbered by a wide margin. The
figures for family incomes follow
about the same pattern.
What I have called the decisive
center in our electorate and what
Richard Nixon called "the forgotten
people" have, I would estimate,
incomes from $7,000 to $15,000. In
1967 these were 46.7% of the voting
population. And if we add those
above $15,000, the total is 58.9%.
That these people have saved a
great deal and therefore have a vast
stake in the fiscal policies of the
government is obvious when we
consider figures published by the
board of governors of the Federal
Reserve System. These are not
broken down according to the
income of their owners. They are
classed as "liquid assets." They
amounted in 1968 to $242 billion.
And this sum has grown from $169.3
billion in 1962.
Another significant figure con-
cerning property ownership is the
number of shareholders in Ameri-
can corporations which is taken
from the statistics of the New York
Stock Exchange. There are now an
estimated 24 million owners of such
stock shares, compared with 6.5
million in 1952. (Fifty per cent of
those owners now are women, who
have traditionally been more conser-
vative than men.)
Of these present owners 8,369,000
are professional, clerical and sales
and managerial and proprietary
people. A million owners are crafts-
men and foremen. And 1,656,000 are
retired people. All these have a
direct interest in the maintenance of
a favorable business climate.
These people in the middle-income
brackets have a further interest in
sound fiscal policies because they
pay the bulk of the taxes, federal,
state and local. The heaviest tax bite
falls upon the incomes from $7,000
to $30,000, with the next heaviest on
the incomes between $30,000 and
$50,000. The very rich pay little of
the total federal income, and the
poor much less.

No doubt candidate Humphrey
will admit the validity of such
figures. But he will also point to the
great increase in the affluence of
these people during the years since
1961. He will claim that the prosper-
ity since 1961 should be credited to
Democratic Administrations and
Congresses. Such claims are tradi-
tional in American politics. "You
never had it so good."
But in predicting the voting
behavior of the newly affluent, we
must reckon on three facts. One is
that prosperity is not created by
government. It is created by the
growth of the private economy.
Another fact is that prices have
increased 23% since 1962 and that
taxes have been heavier, especially
in 1968. These are affected by
government policies.
Finally, there must be faced the
fact of human nature. People are
much less likely to vote their
appreciation for past benefits than
for their present economic interests.
