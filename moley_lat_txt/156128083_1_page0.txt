NEW YORK—James Buckley, the
Conservative Party's candidate for
the Senate seat, now held by Jacob
Javits, is well qualified for the office
which he seeks. But the real
significance of his candidacy is far
more important than winning or
losing any office. For according to
the auspices prevailing in the final
days before the election, his party
may do a great deal to restore the
two-party system in the Empire
State to its original strength and
consistency.
Those who founded the Conserva-
tive Party a few years ago had in
mind giving conservative Republicans
an organized means of registering
their protest against the commitment
of the GOP through its leaders—
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Ja-
vits—to extremely liberal policies.
For the Republican Party in New
York, in following the course of
those leaders, had substantially cut
itself off from the mainstream of the
national GOP.
A second objective of the Conservative
was to negate the influence
of the older Liberal Party which
over two decades has given so many
Democrats the margin they needed
to win.
*
Meanwhile, this year the Democratic
as well as the Liberal Party
have been engaged in internal
struggles which have not only
shattered their unity but substantially
cut them off from the Johnson-
Humphrey leadership of the Democratic
Party.
The New York Daily News pre-
election poll has established over
the years a remarkably good reputation
for accuracy. And, at the
moment, it shows a number of
momentous possibilities.
One of its portents could have been
foretold by anyone. For Sen. Javits
enjoys a commanding lead over
Buckley and Paul O’Dwyer, who
won the Democratic nomination in a
McCarthy sweep against the regular
Democratic choice.
But the poll shows Buckley running
very well when compared with
O’Dwyer. For if Buckley runs fairly
close to O’Dwyer this may well
convince the Democrats that they
had better have no more internal
blood-letting and return to the
sound and fairly moderate tradition
of Alfred E. Smith, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Herbert Lehman, all
distinguished governors of the state.
A high official of the Conservative
Party put it this way: “We started
out to save the soul of the Republican
Party. Now it may be that we
shall rescue the Democratic Party as
well from the kooks and the irreconcilable.”
In 1966 the Conservative Party
won the coveted Row C on the ballot
by polling approximately half a
million votes. As this is written,
Buckley has 14.7% of the straw
the Daily News poll. If this percentage
prevails in the election, the
Conservatives will poll over a million
votes. Buckley’s percentage is
nearly twice that of George Wallace
who hasn’t caught on in New York.

If these predictions prevail in the
election, the Republican Party in
New York will certainly have to do
some soul-searching. For in the
latest Daily News poll, Hubert
Humphrey seems to be on the way
to winning the state’s electoral votes
over Richard Nixon. If this happens,
the Rockefeller-Javits leadership
will not only be confronted with the
formidable Conservative opposition
in the future, but must bear the
onus of losing their state for the
national ticket.
For in September the Conservative
Party attempted to get permission
to run the Republican electors,
pledged to Nixon on Line C as well
as the Republican line on the ballot.
That would almost certainly have
won the state for Nixon. But since
Javits would have had to share the
vote with Buckley, Rockefeller and
Javits chose to play the parts of dogs
in the manger. They refused the
pleas of the Conservatives who then
had to leave the spot on their ticket
blank.
To have accepted the demand of
the Conservatives might have lost
perhaps 200,000 votes to Buckley.
But as it was clear then, and is
certain now, Javits could have
sustained that loss and still won.
The Conservatives can now charge
that the Rockefeller-Javits-Keating
leadership not only deserted their
party in 1964 but in 1968 they may
have delivered the state to Humphrey.
