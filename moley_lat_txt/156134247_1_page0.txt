The hoodlums, hippies and the
cold-blooded academic revolution-
ists seem to have succeeded far
beyond their lurid dreams. For they
have not only disrupted our great
system of higher education and
frustrated our college and universi-
ty administrators but have seeming-
ty unrown our reqeral governme
into a hopeless bind as to what can
be done at that highest level of
government.
As a consequence, President Nix-
on's statement of March 22 on
college disorders must be appraised
as one correspondent put it-a
"hortatory" gesture.
*
However, this "hortatory" func-
tion of the President has not in the
past been without power and effect.
For the great official power vested
by the Constitution and the laws in
the President and the place he
occupies in the minds and hearts of
the people of the United States
provides for him a great reservoir of
influence far beyond the constitu-
tional and legal limits of his office.
Elected by a constituency which
encompasses all other official consti-
tuencies, he is in fact the nation's
voice.
And the measures by which we
judge our past Presidents are large-
ly based upon the extent to which
they have wisely and forcefully
exercised this power which lies
beyond the constitutional and legal
duties of the office they have held.
Without question the President who
in this century has most effectively
used this moral and spiritual in-
fluence was Theodore Roosevelt.
And on more than one occasion
Richard Nixon has spoken of his
great respect and admiration for the
predecessor who carried a big stick
and spoke not softly but vigorously
on every great matter that concerned
his countrymen.
A history of what happened before
President Nixon issued that state-
ment reveals the limits which were
imposed upon him when he spoke.
It was announced by the White
House several days before the
President's statement that the Pres-
ident was planning to say something
about campus disorders. Then, pre-
sumably because Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell had looked into the availa-
bie federal laws upon the subject, it
was announced that the promised
statement would not be issued. The
it was announced that Secretary of
HEW Robert Finch would have
something to say. inen that was
delayed. And then a statement by
the President was reinstated on the
calendar. And then the President
made the statement accompanied by
a letter from Secretary Finch to all
college and university administra-
tors.
The collateral evidence is that in
this period of indecision there was a
process of inter-Administration
buck-passing. Apparently the attor-
ney general was responsible for the
first cancellation of the President's
statement, and he passed the re-
sponsibility for saying something to
Secretary Finch. Then after the
lawyers in the Administration had
examined the laws available it was
decided that the President would
make a statement accompanied by
the letter of Secretary Finch.
The legal tools available to the
federal Administration are three
statutes. One is a law which makes it
a felony to cross state lines for the
purpose of inciting or participating
in a riot. Obviously, the enforcement
of this falls upon the attorney
general. And it is said that the FBI
has plenty of evidence of these
itinerant instruments of revolution.
But since all lawyers hate to lose
cases, plenty of difficulties were
found in enforcing this statute and
also plenty of reasons to believe that
the government would have trouble
in getting the courts, especially the
Supreme Court, to agree.

The other tool consists of provi-
sions in laws passed in 1968 and 1969
designed to withhold federal aid
from students who participate in
campus disorders. But these statutes
are not clear about who is to do the
withholding, the institutions' admi-
nistrators or HEW.
My conclusion is that the hood-
lums will not care a hoot for what
the President says, that to withhold
money from bad students will not
reach the real culprits who get their
keep somewhere else and that the
only way to strike at the trouble is
for the attorney general to prosecute
the people who as we all know cross
state lines and mobilize and direct
these attacks upon our educational
institutions.
And a bit stronger language from
the President will help a lot to put
backbone in college administrators
and to provide leadership and hope
in the great majority of students
who are vainly trying to get an
education.
