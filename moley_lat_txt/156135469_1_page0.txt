.. of More 'Antis' Than 'Pros'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A favorite bit of Sen. Everett
Dirksen's philosophy is that a
political party doesn't win an elec-
tion; the other one loses. This
implies that people vote against and
not for a candidate or party.
Sometimes that has been true. More
often it has not been true.
It was not true when Franklin D.
Roosevelt won reelection in 1936,
1940 and 1944. It was not true in
1952 and 1956 when it was a vote for
Gen. Eisenhower.
But in such "watershed" elections
as 1800, 1828, 1860 and 1932 it was
true. For in those years the elect-
orate clearly voted to end regimes
which had been in power for some
time.

Now, what about 1968?
There were two candidates, Rich-
ard Nixon and George Wallace, who
called for a change. Their combined
vote was about 40 million. Hubert
Humphrey, who received some 30
million votes, represented the Ken-
nedy-Johnson on Administrations
which followed the policies and
traditions of the long Democratic
ascendency from 1933 to 1953. The
Eisenhower years historically will
be classified as an interlude in the
35-year span of Democratic power.
To be sure, the appeals for change
by Nixon and Wallace differed
greatly in degree and emphasis. And
in the case of Wallace, the racial
implications were quite obvious.
None of this prejudice could possib-
ly be charged to Nixon.
But the import was the same:
"Vote against the Johnson-Hum-
phrey regime."
A very important and fruitful
subject of speculation is the ques-
tion of what would have happened
had there been no Wallace in the
contest.
(The official figures are not
available at this time. I depend upon
the unofficial count of the Associat-
ed Press, the News Election Service
and United Press International.)
In discussing with a number of
informed analysts how the Wallace
vote would have been split between
Nixon and Humphrey, they estimat-
ed between 60 and 70% for Nixon.
Therefore, if we take the lower and
more conservative percentage Nix-
on would have had 35.8 million and
Humphrey 33.7 million of the popu-
lar vote. That would have given
Nixon a majority of about 2 million.
In the five states carried by
Wallace, Nixon out-polled Hum-
phrey in one—Georgia. And if there
had been no Wallace, Nixon might
well have carried two more—Arkan-
sas and Louisiana.
In the border states (plus South
Carolina and Florida and minus
Maryland and West Virginia) Wal-
lace out-polled Humphrey in two—
North Carolina and Tennessee.
In any speculation it must be
assumed that if Wallace had not
been in the contest Nixon would
probably have received a larger
percentage of the Negro vote.

The overall pattern of the vote
shows clearly that this election,
despite its special issues and circum-
stances, foreshadows a fundamental
restoration of the two-party system.
The old order in which the Republi-
can Party could win an election only
after conceding the deep South and
most of the border states to the
Democratic candidate is gone, per-
haps forever.
For with a new and vital Republi-
can Party in those states and with
the patronage now possible from a
Republican President, all of the
states will be a battleground for the
two parties.
