President-elect Nixon has intimated
that he plans to reduce the size
and influence of the President's
inner staff of advisers. This, like so
many New Year's resolutions, may
not outlast the winter. But it shows
that he understands what has
become a serious disarrangement in
the federal establishment.
Woodrow Wilson, like most of his
predecessors, had only one male
secretary. The faithful and politically
sophisticated Joseph Patrick Tu-
multy not only arranged the Pres-
ident's appointments but was the
contact with the press and the
liaison with Congress and the Cabinet.
Herbert Hoover had three men
with the title of secretary and also a
man who was called special assis-
tant to the President.
When Franklin D. Roosevelt be-
came President the jealous Louis
Howe assumed sole title to the office
of secretary and reduced Marvin
McIntyre and Stephen Early to
assistant secretaryships. And he
abolished the office of assistant.
After Howe's death and in the
second Roosevelt term, Congress
passed the Reorganization Act. This
provided for six "assistants to the
President." They were, according to
one of the authors of the legislation,
to have a "passion for anonymity," a
phrase attributed to Sir Morris
Hankey, long secretary of the British
cabinet: Needless to say, these
were not anonymous people. They
were both seen and heard. And
during World War II all sorts of
advisers and functionaries accumu-
lated in the White House.
In the Eisenhower years advisers
and specialists gathered like flies on
a fruit cake. Over them lorded
Sherman Adams as a sort of exalted
prime minister.
It was in the Eisenhower Era
when there was an unprecedented
growth of the White House staff.
The budget for fiscal 1962, which
was prepared by President Eisen-
hower, estimated the total cost of
the White House staff at $2,112,000.
This was to cover 272 people.
Some of this was for the many
faceless factotums who shuffle pa-
pers and maintain the routine
business of the executive office. The
physical maintenance of the place is
another category.
But in the Camelot Era President
Kennedy enlarged his staff with
quite an array of well-known and
well-publicized personalities. Pre-
sumably this was to win the intellec-
tuals of the country by giving some
of them a piece of the action. This
cost an additional $250,000 in the
1964 budget.
Lyndon Johnson, with somewhat
less accent upon the academic, but
with more pay, enlarged the esti-
mates until in the present fiscal year
1969 the figure reached $3,229,000,
of which $2,707,000 is for salaries.
But the most interesting evidence
of growth is that there is provision
for 14 people with salaries up to
$30,000. This is beyond the compen-
sations of most college presidents
and is only a rather small margin
below that of Cabinet members. And
it was recently reported that the
first Nixon designee as a presiden-
tial assistant, Bryce Harlow, is to get
the top figure mentioned above. The
nonpecuniary advantages of those
top positions are considerable. Their
letters go on prestigious White
House stationery and their tele-
phones are on the White House
board. And when they decide to
leave they are eagerly sought by
private agencies for jobs in the
$100,000 range.
The unfortunate consequence of
the great growth of the White
House staff is that it diminishes the
responsibility and prestige of the
office Cabinet. Surrounded as he
was by superadvisers, why should
the President use the Cabinet as
counsel? In fact, President Kennedy
called fewer and fewer Cabinet
meetings. Why consult the secretary
of state when he had under his roof
the ex-Harvard dean, McGeorge
Bundy, and the royal historian,
Arthur Schlesinger? And also broth-
er Robert.
It will be well if the new President
should restore the official Cabinet to
its historical roleâ€”a real council of
advisers. And Nixon should know
that better than anyone else. For
when President Eisenhower was
stricken with a heart attack, "prime
minister" Adams took over and Vice
President Nixon was allowed only a
seat in the Adams office.
