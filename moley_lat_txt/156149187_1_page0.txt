Nixon Has Re-established the
Two-Party System in the U.S.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For the past three weeks I have
been telling friends that if Hubert
Humphrey was gaining, as seemed
probable, it would be either Richard
Nixon or chaos.
That refrain kept going through
my mind during the long vigil
Tuesday night and Wednesday
morning, for with Humphrey gain-
ing and George Wallace as strong as
the polls represented him to be, we
would have faced a grave constitu-
tional crisis. Humphrey, according
to all portents, could not possibly
have won 270 votes.
The issue then would have been
the people whom Wallace had
selected as his electors in the states
he carried. I talked with several
reputable Republican leaders in the
South on the day before the election
and from their knowledge of these
elector-candidates they said that "un-
der no circumstances" would they
have voted to throw the election in-
to the House and thus probably have
elected Humphrey.
The alternative has haunted me
for months. Under the Constitution
and the statutes these electors would
have registered their votes on Dec.
charges that he was a "loser" by en-
tering all of the primaries and he la-
bored with incredible energy
through the long months since Jan-
uary.
But another individual unmen-
tioned in the comments since the
victory should share this honor. He
is Republican National Chairman
Ray Bliss, who assumed command
of a badly defeated and divided
party in 1965 and has built muscle
into his tattered legions by incredi-
ble efforts at the grass roots, He is a
quiet man but his remarkable talent
for organization was indispensable
to this victory. He built party
loyalty and recruited volunteer
workers by his workshops in many
states-North, South and West.
Moreover, Nixon and Bliss have
done something which has been
needed ever since the Civil War:
they have united the Republican
Party on a national scale. The Solid
South of history is gone forever.
Those southern states, some despite
their temporary allegiance to Wal-
lace, will now begin to elect officials
all along the line who will become a
permanent influence in party af-
fairs. The Republican Party down
there and in the border states is
going to be a force to be reckoned
with from now on.
Once again after the great division
arising from the slavery question
and disunion we are blessed, then,
with an authentic two-party system.
A two-party system works best
when the margin between the two
parties is not so wide as to permit
the majority to assume the con-
fidence of continued control. This is
the most important result of this
election.
"So why do we keep comin' here?"

16 and those votes would have been
transmitted to Congress on Jan. 6.
A statute of 1887 provides that
when this happens any senator and
representative jointly may protest
the votes of any of these electors.
Considering who these electors
were and how they were chosen,
some of these objections might have
been sustained. That might well
have resulted in long congressional
investigations and debate and pro-
bably in court action.
Thus the government of the
country would have sustained a
substantial paralysis, perhaps for
weeks and months. We have now
escaped this grave threat by the
legitimate election of Nixon in the
electoral college.
The honor, glory and the power of
this victory are well deserved by
Richard Nixon. It has been a long
trail since he entered Congress 22
years ago. It has been marked by
bitter disappointments and frustra-
tions and his triumph in the face of
these reverses becomes a durable
fact of history. He answered the
