Electoral College Muddle
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For something like 165 years
members of. Congress and others
have been trying to find a better
way to elect Presidents. Only once
have these efforts succeeded in
amending the Constitution in 1804
when Amendment 12 was added.
The issue emerged again atter last
November's election of Richard
Nixon. The grave constitutional
crisis that was threatened by the
candidacy of George Wallace has
alerted Congress to the desirability
of some fundamental change. And a
Senate subcommittee headed by
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and the
House Judiciary Committee chaired
by Rep. Emanuel Celler (D-N.Y.)
have held exhaustive hearings.

At the moment there are few who
will predict that any one of the three
major plans will be adopted by the
necessary two-thirds in each house.
All that seems possible is an
amendment correcting some of the
minor defects in the present system.
A hopeless deadlock seems to
prevail among the three major
proposals: the popular election plan,
the district plan and the proportion-
al plan. Support for each plan
depends upon the philosophical
convictions of its sponsors and the
constituencies which they represent.
And there are some who would
keep the system as it is, with a few
minor changes, because they believe
that any of the plans would meet
difficulties, some of which are now
unforeseen.
I feel that despite its number of
sponsors in the Senate, the support
of leaders in the House and the
public opinion polls, direct popular
elections would present grave mat-
ters of principle and practice.

The most important of the objec-
tions to a popular election concerns
its possible effect upon the federal
system with divided powers the
federal government on the one hand
and the states on the other. It is on
this division of power and responsi-
bility that the nation's safety and
the people's liberty depend. A
President should not merely be
concerned with people but also with
the various areas in which the
people manage their own special
affairs.
On the practical side, there are
even more grave objections to
popular election. Under the present
constitutional system, the states
determine voter qualifications and
operate the election machinery. Is it
intended that all state laws govern-
ing the qualifications and the opera-
tion of elections be taken over by
the government in Washington? Or
is it to be a system under which
there will be two sets of qualifica-
tions and two sets of machinery to
conduct elections?
Under the former plan the states
and counties and other local subdivi-
sions would ultimately be absorbed
in a vast national regime. If there
are to be two sets of qualifications,
utter confusion would ensue, for
some people would be voting for
President and some would be voting.
for governors and sheriffs. And a
dual system of administration would
not only be most expensive but, in

takes a notion!"
actual management at the polls,
utterly confusing.
Moreover, some of the plans for
popular election provide for a run-
off election in case no candidate gets
a majority in the regular polling.
(Some would provide for such a run-
off in case no one gets 40%.)
Consider the strain on candidates in
such a run-off. In most instances by
November they will have been
campaigning for nine months. Then
with a run-off, two more months
would be required. Consider the
expense to the party and candidates'
organizations. And, unless the inau-
guration were moved forward-to
say, March 4 the successful candi-
date would have little or no time to
organize his administration. It is bad
enough as it is. The Nixon people
have found that out.
If we are to have a fundamental
change, the district system is best.
But at the moment that seems to
have only limited support. And so
we shall probably go muddling
along as before.
