Federal Reorganization's Hardly
Likely but Some Could Be Used!
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It's doubtful whether any new
Cabinet officer ever took over the
department to which he was as-
signed without big and bright ideas
about how it should be reorganized.
And the 12 good men and true who
were presented by President-elect
Nixon will he no exceptions. No
doubt they will find as the months
pass that they will have their hands
full trying to understand the mean-
ing and purpose of bureaucratic
monstrosities over which, at least
nominally, they must preside.
But in these final happy days
before their real work begins, there
have been a lot of brave plans about
reorganization. Some of this per-
tains to the idea of consolidation
among the departments already in
existence.
One suggestion is that the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare absorb the two latest mem-
bers-Housing and Urban Develop-
ment and Transportation-into a
vast new entity called the Depart-
ment of Human Resources. But any
such semantic change (for the
present bureaus and agencies would
still be there) would encounter not
only the consent of Congress but the
willingness of the new secretaries
George Romney and John Volpe to
give up the honors and perquisites
they have so gladly assumed. Once
seated, a department head cherishes
his office like a cat seeking the
warmest place before the fireplace.
There was talk about the merger
of Commerce with Labor a while
ago, but that failed. And from
another source has come a sugges-
tion about merging Agriculture and
Interior in a big affair perhaps to be
called a Department of Natural
Resources.
Assuredly there is overlapping. I
offer one small example:
The Rural Electrification Admin-
istration (Agriculture) has given a
loan to a co-operative in Alaska to
minister to 20,000 Indians, Eskimos
and Aleuts in 95 villages. This will
involve co-operation among the
Office of Economic Opportunity (the
President's office), the Bureau of
Indian Affairs (Interior), the De-
partment of Labor and the state of
Alaska.
Throughout the federal establish-
ment overlapping is so common that
there is a large number of bureau-
crats in all departments to look after
overlapping.
As we look back into the origins of
the present departments we find
that for the most part (except in
those which existed under President
Washington) they were created
because either a function in an
existing department became impor-
tant enough to claim individual
recognition or because a lot of new
activities were created by Congress
and needed to be nicely packaged in
one new department.
The general theory (if there has
been a theory) has been that a
department represents certain broad
interests either in the government
itself (Defense or Post Office) or in
the private sector (Commerce, La-
bor, Agriculture) or a lot of new
activities assumed by the federal
government which were formerly
state, local or private affairs. And
that the heads of such departments
speak for those interests to the
President, Congress and the public
generally. They are thus the voices
of special interests.
Later on we may see, as we have
seen in the past, struggles between
department heads over the control
of agencies. One example of this war
of acquisition was the long fight in
the 1930s when Secretary Harold
Ickes tried to take the Forest
Service into his Interior Department
and away from Henry Wallace's
Department of Agriculture.

So far as the present Department
of HEW is concerned, it has really
grown to such proportions as to be
unmanageable. Instead of absorbing
more, it should be divided into three
new Departments of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare. There is nothing
sacred about 12 except the Apostles,
the months of the year, the hours on
our watches and the signs of the
zodiac.
The Cabinet itself has long ceased
to be a place where the President
can make policy. In the Kennedy
years Cabinet meetings were practi-
cally dispensed with. The President
makes policy with whatever people
he believes to be most helpful. So let
us have 15 departments which
should include the Director of the
Budget as the representative of the
interests of all of us who are
burdened with taxes.
