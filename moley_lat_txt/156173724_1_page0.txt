A Commentator Retires, With
Certain Grave Forebodings
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
With the filing of this piece I
terminate my years as a journalist.
They began 36 years ago when I
resigned from the Roosevelt Ad-
ministration to undertake the editor-
ship of Today, a new weekly
magazine. In doing so I was realizing
an ambition I had conceived years
before when graduated from college.
In turning to journalism as a
profession, I terminated not only a
short career in national politics and
in public office, but substantially a
good many years in teaching which
reached a professorship at Columbia
University.
I have never regretted that deci-
sion in 1933. It was rewarded by
giving me the happiest and most
satisfying period in my life. In a
highly competitive field Today
learned from its mistakes and in 1937
it became Newsweek, in which as
contributing editor I wrote a weekly
commentary of opinion thereafter.
By 1963 I celebrated a rather
unusual record: I have never missed
a weekly deadline except for four
weeks in 1957 when Sen. Harry F.
Byrd was my guest. There had been
at that milepost 1,560 articles under
my by-line. At the end of 1967 I
ended my editorial contributions to
Newsweek, continuing my newspa-
per column until now. That syndi-
cated series began in 1942 with three
pieces a week which were reduced
to one a week in 1961.
Why should I not be happy as I
look back at those years as a jour-
nalist? I have been at liberty to com-
ment on the events of a momentous
period, and no publisher or editor
had ever told me what to write, what
not to write, or criticized my choice
of opinions. That was true of both
the magazine and the newspaper. In
the latter, to be sure, editors were
free to refrain from publishing my
contributions or to discontinue the
relationship without comment.
These brief chronicles of the times
have concerned themselves with a
change in our national life and
public policies greater than in any
period since colonial days. And
perhaps my reflections on that
change deserve note in this final
piece.
In a similar summing up, Arthur
Krock at the end of his Memoirs
says this about what he calls "the
great change":
"From these consequences I have
contracted a visceral fear. It is that
the tenure of the United States as
the first power in the world may be
one of shortest in history."
I cannot claim a parity with
Arthur Krock as a writer nor in
capacity for observation. But there
are parallels. He and I were born in
the same year in the Midwest and
we spent our earlier years there. We
have witnessed the same national
scene, commented upon the same
national trends and have known
most of the same national figures
who have shaped national policy.
We were both brought up in the old-
style Democratic Party and both
have noted the transformation of
that party by F.D.R. around 1936.
There began "the great change."
*
I agree with the many specifics
which prompted Arthur Krock's
somber conclusion. Foremost among
them are the transformation of a
federal, union into a mass democra-
cy; a republic which has become a
paternal welfare state which, as: De
Tocqueville prophesied 134 years
ago, "takes upon itself alone the
power to secure (for its subjects)
their gratifications and to watch
over their fate," and to pay for this
monstrous paternalism the accep-
tance of a ruinous fiscal policy.
These I believe are but the
symptoms of a deeper infection. A
state of apathetic permissiveness
induced by twin delusions: that
great national might is ours in
perpetuity and that what is called a
free society is indestructible.
Perhaps these delusions are in-
duced by confusing freedom with
liberty. Santayana has reminded us
that semantically freedom is Teuto-
nic in orgin and liberty is Latin. The
"blessings of liberty" as written by
the makers of our Constitution
imply laws and authority which
protect those who enjoy them.
Freedom provides no blessings. It
creates no environment but chaos.
*
Our conceits about indestructible
national power and liberty have
blinded us to our responsibilities
abroad as the world's foremost
power. This might have been possib-
le in a world of like-minded nations.
But the Communist challenge denies
those assumptions and is bent on
destroying our might and on obliter-
ating personal liberty everywhere.
In this real world there can be no
isolation and no fortress America.
My question is whether we can
afford our delusions. I leave the
answer to those commentators who
remain and who only yesterday
welcomed "the great change." I am
glad to see now so many of them
painfully reassessing their earlier
assumptions.
