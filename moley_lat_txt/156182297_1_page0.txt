The Indispensable Ray Bliss
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At this writing President-elect
Nixon has neither confirmed nor
denied persistent rumors that he
will seek to replace Ray Bliss as
Republican national chairman. Such
a change would be most unfortunate
at a moment when a vigorous and
united GOP is so essential to the
reconstruction of the two-party sys-
tem. The rumors include the sugges-
tion that the national chairman
should be an evangelist rather than
a manager.
In electing Bliss in the spring of
1965, the National Committee made
a very important break from past
traditions in the party. Except for
the years in the 1950s when Leonard
Hall was chairman, the position was
usually given to some individual on
a part-time basis who made speeches
at party functions and acted gener-
ally as a GOP evangelist. Sometimes
those people held an official position
at the same time, such as U.S.
senator or congressman.
After Hall resigned in 1957, Meade
Alcorn served for a while and then
Sen. Thruston Morton and later
Rep. William Miller. When Miller
resigned to run for Vice President,
Dean Burch served through the
Goldwater campaign and into 1965.
And considering the overwhelming
odds of that election year, Burch did
very well.

But in selecting Bliss, the National
Committee looked for a permanent,
full-time chairman, solely and dis-
tinctly dedicated to party manage-
ment and to working with state and
local parties in building GOP mem-
bership, party spirit and national
influence. It should be noted that
former President Eisenhower heart-
ily approved of the selection of Bliss
at that time and so did the titular
head of the party, Sen. Barry
Goldwater.
Bliss had made a remarkable
record in Ohio. After a crushing
party defeat in 1958, which was not
his fault, he put new life into the
party which not only gave Nixon his
largest state majority in 1960 but, by
1964, a Republican governor, most
of the congressional seats and
control of the legislature.
The following figures are most
significant: since 1964 the number of
Republican governors has increased
from 17 to 31, which is the largest
proportion of Republican governors
since after the Harding landslide in
1920.
*
There were 32 Republican U.S.
senators in 1965; now there are 42.
In the house of Representatives a
gain has been made from 140 to 192
Republican members. The party has
gained 43 statewide offices other
than governorships. When Bliss
began, the Republicans controlled
only seven legislatures. Now they
have 20. The gain in individual
legislators has been 641. There are
97 more Republican mayors than
there were in 1964. And in county
offices, the gain has been 1,420.
Thus, in his quiet but immensely
efficient efforts, Bliss has substanti-
ally re-created the Republican Party
over the country. It is true that he
had the help of Nixonâ€™s very
considerable campaigning in 1966.
But it is hard to deny Bliss credit for
the work that was done at the grass
roots which enabled Nixon to win
majorities this year in 36 states.
As a recognition of his efforts,
and especially for the efficient
manner in which the Republican
convention was managed this year,
the National Committee at its meet-
ing in Miami Beach reelected him
chairman by a unanimous vote. It
always has been assumed that this
action of the National Committee
substantially guaranteed the chair-
man a four-year term.
But to make a change with the
inauguration of a new President, in
this important office which has been
so efficiently managed, will no
doubt have serious consequences
within the party itself.
