Administration's Not Yet Up
to Scratch, on Itch for Jobs
RY RAYMOND MOLEY
The late Homer Cummings, who
was Franklin D. Roosevelt's first
attorney general, was a wise and
witty statesman.
Some weeks after the Democratic
Party had taken over the govern-
ment in 1933, a Democratic dinner
was held to celebrate the early
achievements of the New Deal. But
instead of rejoicing there was a
strong undercurrent of unhappiness
among the diners about the dearth
of jobs and favors for the people
who had labored so valiantly in the
great crusade of the previous year.
Cummings was scheduled as the
final speaker. He gave them a
glowing account of what the new
President was doing for the country
but was reticent about what had
been done for the regulars in the
Democratic Party. In conclusion he
turned to the complaints of the
politicians:
"Don't worry," he said. "There
may be a few Democrats in office
who have been overlooked by three
Republican Presidents. But when
we find them, we'll root 'em out."
Something of the same discontent
is widespread today among Republi-
can politicians in Congress and
elsewhere about the thin portions of
patronage which have been accord-

ed the faithful since the inaugura-
tion of President Nixon. Perhaps the
immature and somewhat absurd
activities of people around Mr.
Nixon after the election and before
the inauguration are to blame.
These people, failing to realize the
difficulties attending a change in
command, excited great expecta-
tions among the people who had
participated in the campaign.
One of the operations involved the
dispatch of tens of thousands of
letters to individuals whose names
were found in Who's Who. These
requested the names of people who
would be available to serve in the
new Administration. Many who
received the letters regarded the
thing as a practical joke. But many
others took the letters seriously and
deluged the Nixon headquarters
with names of people suitable for
places in the government.
Of course, the recipients of the
letters were not slow to tell the
people whom they named that they
had been asked by the President-
elect to recommend and that they
had complied. It has been reported
that at least six people presented
themselves for a single job in one
department. Since the new depart-
ment heads of necessity had to be
very careful in filling the available
exempt jobs, this resulted in a
multitude of lacerated egos.

Another source of unhappiness
was the announced decision of the
President and the new postmaster
general to put into effect a plan
proposed two years ago by a
committee headed by a distin-
guished businessman, Frederick R.
Kappel, to take the appointment of
postmasters out of politics.
This plan had been endorsed by
the incumbent postmaster general,
Lawrence O'Brien, in glowing
terms. Presumably, both Lyndon
Johnson and O'Brien, experienced
politicians, had no intention to put
the plan into operation with an
election just around the corner. And
so they left the plan as a sort of
booby trap for the next President. It
is a plan which has great merit and
it should ultimately be adopted. But
the Nixon Administration has been
deeply felt by Republican members
of Congress.
There seem to have been many
guesses as to the number of really
important jobs which lie outside
Civil Service. Published estimates
have varied from 1,000 to 6,000.

But practical problems confront
every new department head. From
the moment he enters his new
offices he is confronted by problems
to be solved and decisions to be
made. He can't provide the answers
without information and advice.
And the people who can supply that
information and give the advice are
in the ranks of the holdovers. Thus
these veterans become indispensa-
ble. To displace them with new and
green hands is to risk mistakes. And
so the pace of new appointments is
necessarily slow.
One new hand in a department
said recently that the thin layer of
new people becomes distressingly
thinner by the day. But the protests
of those who want jobs grow ever
more plaintive and shrill. And much
of the blame falls upon the head of
the President â€” a head which is
bowed already with grave problems
which have nothing to do with jobs.
