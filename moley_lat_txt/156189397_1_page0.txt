College Students Have a Valid
Complaint on Teaching Setup
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Most of the cases of student unrest
go back a good many years. A bit of
history about Columbia will provide
an excellent example.

As I noted in a piece recently, the
senior faculties there virtually
gained control of educational poli-
cies about 50 years ago. The major
professors, whose security was as-
sured by what is now everywhere
called "tenure," won the power of
appointment, promotion and the
determination of what was to be
taught and how.

At the same time, a fundamental
change was made in the teaching
load of the permanent staff. After
professors had been assured of
permanent tenure, had taught in
undergraduate divisions (especially
in Columbia College) and had writ-
ten a book or two, they were
promoted to the graduate faculties
of political science, philosophy and
pure science. Their new teaching
loads were generally four hours a
week, one two-hour lecture and a
seminar. The undergraduates were
then left to the relatively inexper-
ienced instructors and assistant
professors. The change was made
neglected rather than kept. Most
students writing these essays or
dissertations spend only a few hours
in the year with their guiding
mentors.

As I have indicated, the reason
given for these light teaching loads
was that there would be more time
for research and writing. Here I can
speak only on the social sciences in
which my own interests lay, but
there the output of significant books
and written contributions have been
far less than in the earlier dispensa-
tion which prevailed when I was a
student. For such professors as
Charles A. Beard, Franklin Gid-
dings, James Harvey Robinson,
Hubert Osgood, John Bassett Moore,
Frank Goodnow and E.R.A. Sailing-
ham not only wrote more books but
included undergraduates in their
classes.

But for the most part, the teaching
of undergraduates is still left to
untrained and low-paid teachers.
These juniors have little or no
experience in the classroom, for
their graduate training makes no
provision for learning the art of
teaching. Nor have these green
instructors any background of
knowledge to illuminate their lec-
tures or class discussions. Students
are like the man who goes to a noted
doctor to cure him and finds himself
turned over to an intern.

Of course, the students are bored
and frustrated when they find
themselves forced into a huge class
with a novice on the platform. They
are shortchanged. They selected a
university whose reputation was
won long ago by luminous educa-
tors, but they never see any of these
well-known figures. They might
better have gone to a smaller college
where there were only undergra-
duates and the professors were less
eminent. And the result is that
many students came to be restless,
rebellious activists outside the class-
room. They blame the administra-
tion. They should blame the faculty.

*

I speak here only of Columbia, but
the same situation prevails in every
big institutionâ€”Harvard, Cornell,
Berkeley, Chicago and elsewhere.

The situation which I describe
does not prevail in Barnard College,
which has its own president and
board of trustees. There the major
professors still teach undergraduate
courses, but some of them also teach
graduate courses. So far as Colum-
bia College is concerned, recently
the graduate professors are teaching
one undergraduate course half a
year each year.

The real remedy is not greater
participation of students in adminis-
tration but more teaching by those
who are able to interest and inspire
those who are really seeking an
education.
