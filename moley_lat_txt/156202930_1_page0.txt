Vital Salt-Water Arteries
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since the President of the United
States has so many diplomatic irons
in the fire, what he says at one time
on any one subject must fall short of
a complete statement of both imme-
diate and ultimate objectives. This
was true of Mr. Nixon's address on
Vietnam on May 14. For his immedi-
ate objective was to provide back-
ground for his negotiators in Paris.
This was to bring about a halt in the
fighting, stop the aggressive actions
of Hanoi and its stooges, the Viet
Cong, and to eliminate Hanoi's
intrusion into Laos and Cambodia.
*
Beyond this there was the sugges-
tion that should we abandon those
immediate objectives the remaining
countries in Southeast Asia, Thai-
land and the Malay Peninsula would
soon succumb to overwhelming
Communist pressure from the east
and north. Thus the major concern
is to keep all of the peninsula of
Southeast Asia within the orbit of
the non-Communist world.
There was even implicit in the
Nixon broadcast the vital concern of
other countries on the perime-
ter from Japan to Korea, to Austra-
lia and New Zealand. This is the
"domino" theory: If Southeast
Asia falls, we might be fighting in
larger wars within two years.
The United States, because of its
role after World War II, proposed to
defend the sovereignty of those
countries.
The United States did not seek
these responsibilities. They fell
upon us because of our victory over
Japan, our overwhelming naval
power and our concern for Taiwan,
the Philippines and Australia. And
because of British weakness at
home, which has made inevitable
the withdrawal of the erstwhile
Queen of the Seas from its Asiatic
commitments.
Basic in all this is the responsibili-
ty of our nation as the world's
greatest naval power. And here,
because our only naval and potential
challenger on the sea is Soviet
Russia, the President did not choose
to comment, That, no doubt, was
because of our urgent desire to
reach agreements to limit the dan-
ger of nuclear war. But there is no
doubt that all three Presidents who
have moved in defense of South
Vietnam have realized this ultimate
objective.
That ultimate objective is to keep
the sea lanes open to the commerce
of all nations. This is what we mean
by "freedom of the seas."
In a real sense, this freedom in the
past has been and still is whatever a
nation with dominant naval power
chooses to protect. For more than a
century that nation was Great
Britain. Since World War II it has
been the United States. This domin-
ation carries with it the responsibili-
ty to protect our own commerce as
well as that of other nations, small
and large. In the Far East our naval
and air power assures access to the
sea by all of the countries described
above, as well as Soviet Russia.

Clearly, to understand why we
must seek to keep the peninsula of
Southeast Asia within the orbit of
the Free World, we should study the
map. Immediately to the south and
adjacent to South Vietnam, Cambo-
dia, Thailand and the Malay Penin-
sula is the channel between the Pa-
cific and Indian oceans. The great
sea lanes thus run through the Strait
of Malacca.
This is one of the busiest channels
in the world. It is of vital concern to
every maritime nation. For beyond
that strait are western Australia,
India, Pakistan and the Arab coun-
tries and eastern Africa. These areas
bordering on the Indian Ocean have
immense resources of raw materi-
als essential to all industrial nations,
as well as markets for manufactured
goods.
The United States and the West-
ern Hemisphere are no longer self-
sufficient. Some of our essential
materials must come from the
Pacific and beyond. And this stuff
must come and go by sea.
Soviet Russia, as well as other
maritime nations, has a great inter-
est in the Indian Ocean. Thus
Asiatic communism, which might
mean an enlarged North Vietnam or
Red China, must not dominate
Southeast Asia and thus threaten
this great sea lane.
