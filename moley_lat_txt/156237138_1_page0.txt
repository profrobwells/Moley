Arctic Sea Route
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The proposal of the Humble Oil
and Refining Co. and associated
companies to spend millions to
create a sea route from the Alaskan
and Canadian oil fields to the
Atlantic Ocean should ignite the
interest of every observer of foreign
affairs. For this plan, if successfully
carried out, will be of incalculable
advantage to the Western world. An
incidental result will be to teach
land-locked and isolationist Ameri-
cans the vital importance of trade
routes by sea in the shaping of this
nation's foreign policy.

As every schoolboy knows, Co-
lumbus' purpose was to find a route
westward to the Orient. While his
voyages opened a new continent,
they did not achieve their earlier
purpose. Five years after 1492
another Italian, John Cabot, who
had removed to England, received
authority and means from King
Henry VII to seek a sea route north
of the American continent to "India
and Cathay." His efforts and those
of his son Sebastian ended in icy
frustration.
In the next century Sir Martin
Frobisher renewed the quest, but he
had to settle for claiming certain icy
lands in the name of Queen Eli-
zabeth and by bringing back to
England certain ore which proved to
be worthless,
In the years that followed there
were many explorations, until in
1648 Sir John Franklin, a veteran of
Trataigar and of several land explor-
ations, set out with two ships to find
the Northwest Passage. His expedi-
tion vanished and it was 14 years
later that the remains were found.
All hands had perished.
In this century a great deal more
been added to information about the
geography of the region, and new
technology has added to the means
of exploration and communication.
In 1906 Roald Amundsen announced
he had made a passage with a small
ship and six companions. The voy-
age consumed three years.
Subsequently, exploration of wa-
ter passages through the icy north
of the Canadian mainland conti-
nued. Smaller Canadian vessels
made a number of passages prior to
1956. But there still remained the
task of finding a route for larger
ship transportation. The American
Navy was interested because of its
need for supply routes for our
Distant Early Warning System.

In 1956 Canadian Capt. Pullen and
a crew of 240 on the Canadian ship
Labrador made a passage in which a
key channel was the Bellot Strait,
rescuing an American ice-breaker in
the course of the voyage.
Meanwhile, a great deal has been
learned about the depth and width
of channels by nuclear submarines
operating under the ice.
All this knowledge will be known
to the effort announced this month
by the Humble president, Charles F.
Jones. The first effort will be a trip
from New York in July by the big
tanker Manhattan, which has been
reconstructed for ice-breaking. But
once such a route becomes practical
for tankers, his company will build
six huge ice-breaking tankers at a
cost of $300 million. And other
companies, he says, with oil proper-
ties in Alaska and northern Canada
will probably build 25 or 30 tankers
for their purpose.
For the oil potential in that field is
estimated to be equal to or more
than that of the entire Middle East.
