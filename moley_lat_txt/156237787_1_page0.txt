Persian Gulf Pressure-Point
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is somewhat early to calculate
the effect upon the economies of the
Western nations and Japan of the
immense oil discoveries in northern
Alaska and Canada and the project-
ed sea routes from those sources to
the East and West. That was the
subject of my piece a week ago. But
meanwhile those countries, except
the United States, are heavily
dependent upon oil from the Persian
Gulf area.
According to a recent report by
the Georgetown Center for Strategic
and International Studies, half of
Western Europe's oil supplies and
80% of Japan's come from that gulf
area; Britain's and France's one-
half, West Germany's one-third,
Italy's 75%. And our operations in
Southeast Asia are largely depen-
dent upon oil from the gulf.

This oil must in major part be
transported by more or less clearly
defined sea routes. The Georgetown
report says that "any situation
which would put a major power
hostile to the West astride these oil
supplies would be intolerable." And,
here might be added, any sea routes
leading from those supplies must
not be threatened by Communist
powers.
Those routes, as well as the
stability of the gulf region, have
recently been profoundly affected
by two developments: One is the
planned withdrawal of the British
from the Indian Ocean, from its
stabilizing influence among the
Arab states and from the channels
from the gulf to the Pacific and the
Atlantic. The other is the growing
sea power of Soviet Russia, its naval
and commercial presence in the
Indian Ocean and, because of the
closing of the Suez Canal, its use of
the sea route from its huge base at
Vladivostok arour Southeast Asia.
Traditionally, the relative impor-
tance of nations, their relations to
each other and the rivalries among
them are importantly affected by
changing sea routes. At this time the
two developments described above
are of profound importance not only
to the countries directly concerned
but to the United States, whose
naval power is still predominant.
The American role involves its
commitment to its insistence upon
freedom of the seas and the séa
passages for our friends and also our
potential rivals. This involvės a
considerable burden which, while
decried by our land-locked isolation-
ists at home, is imposed upon us by
our great sea power and in the
Western Pacific by our victory in
World War II and the subsequent
disarmament of Japan. Soviet Rus-
sia has no such commitment to
freedom of the seas.
Japan's growth as an industrial
nation (accentuated by the disar-
mament imposed by us) has ren-
dered it heavily dependent upon oil
and iron ore available only by sea.
In large part these components are
supplied by the Persian Gulf, the
United States, Australia and India.
These supplies must come by two sea
routes: the Strait of Malacca and
through the Indonésian islands.
These routes, unless we choose to
turn Japan toward communism, we
must protect.
For reasons quite unlike those of
Japan, Soviet Russia uses the Strait
of Malacca (now that Suez is closed)
for access into the Indian Ocean and
the Persian Gulf.

The Soviet government has built
an immense base at Vladivostok out
of which there emerges all of the
components of sea power: navy
units, merchant ships, its fishing
and oceanographic research fleet. Its
route passes friendly North Vietnam
where it finds facilities for refueling
and refitting. And its behavior
indicates every intention to move
into the gap created by British
withdrawal.
The Georgetown report says that
"the minimum Soviet goal is to end
the Western power monopoly in the
Persian Gulf by its presence there
while its maximum goal is to
dominate the oil sources there and
exclude it to the Western nations
and Japan.
