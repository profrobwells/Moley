Some Election
Portents
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The cheerful faces you see in the street
these days belong to Republicans They
feel something in the air There has been
a change in the direction of the wind
The hot, dry currents of 10 years have
shifted and there is a cool tang now
Boy, are they sucking big whiffs of it
into the poor, parched lungs!
Dr Gallup's polls are punishing on Republican gains in Congress He also
shows Dewey running far ahead of Bennett in New York State The New York
Daily News poll confirms this In Illinois
polls show Senator Brooks running well
ahead of his 1940 figure, when he was
elected
A summary of the estimates of 50
Washington correspondents published this
week gives the Republicans a gain of
29 seats in the new House and five more
Senatorships This brings the alignment
to 194 Republicans, 235 Democrats and
six others
These correspondents list the factors
that will influence this change of sentiment. Most important, they say, is public
dissatisfaction with the inefficiency and
confusion of the administration's war
effort, as indicated by bottlenecks in materials and conflicting statements on manpower Next in importance, they say,
is public feeling that the administration
has failed to crack down on labor and has
coddled the public by withholding information. Dissatisfaction with Congress
is also listed.

REPUBLICAN ISSUES

These are all Republican issues Theoretically, the Republicans have not created
them Practically, no opposition party
creates its issues It profits by the mistakes
of the people in power. Even when
so-called "constructive" issues are proposed by an opposition, they are in the
nature of cures for political ailments implanted by the people in office. All that
an opposition can do is to formulate ringing
denunciations of things that everybody knows
The complaint that the Republican party
has presented no issues is beside the
mark. Issues are not made by speeches
They are made by the impression created
in voters' minds by the quality of service
their government is giving Speeches
create nothing They merely signalize
something that already exists Speeches
are usually necessary exercises by candidates, but the general rule is that, while
speeches may lose votes, they seldom gain
any Hence the speechmaker seeks to
avoid mistakes and contents himself with
generalities This is something to remember these autumn evenings when the
radio is turned on
Reports from all quarters point to a
light vote in the forthcoming elections.
Primary and registration figures generally
show a falling-off from 1938 But the picture
is not so dark as the complaints
would seem to indicate First of all, there
are many places where a fairly normal
vote is indicated In down State Illinois
registration is big In New York City
the drop below 1938 is not especially
large The figures do not justify the intensity
of the complaints American
democracy is not yet tottering to its ruin

LIGHT VOTE'S MEANING

There has always been a good deal of
nonsense talked and written about light
voting, and this year has seen a rash of
it A light vote is not a sign of the failure
of democracy A light vote may be a very
discriminating vote And a heavy vote
brought out at some recent Presidential
elections has carried into office on the
coattails of the head of the ticket some
of the most arrant fools in the country
Nor is a light vote the sign of a lack
of issues, as Dr Gallup contends It may
be a sign that the issues are not understood by a mob of voters But there may
be issues that discriminating people can
see, and such issues exist this year It's
the quality, not the number of votes,
that is important. And every sign indicates that, except for the soldiers and
some other exceptions, it is not going to
be the most intelligent voters who will
stay away from the polls this year
Perfectly obvious causes will account
for a light vote Immense numbers have
changed their residence, others are legitimately preoccupied with war work, many
people must travel for business reasons,
and there is, of course, the great number
in military service Absentee voting cannot
make up for all this
Add all these together and the fact
will emerge that there is no unusual indifference to the problems of government.
Those who vote, it seems, will give Congress a big shake-up, and this means that
a better Congress is inevitable,
