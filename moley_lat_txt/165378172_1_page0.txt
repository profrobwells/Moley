Anniversary
on the Lakes
The Great Mesabi Range, Opened
50 Years Ago, is Backlog of the
War for Iron and Steel
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This month of October marks the 50th
anniversry of an event that means more
to the cause of victory in this war than
any other single thing. It was probably
the most significant event in the history
of American industry Up on the Mesabi
Range in Northern Minnesota 50 years
ago, a load of iron ore was put on a
barge and shipped down the Great Lakes.
It arrived in Cleveland on Nov. 11.
In 11 years the Mesabl Range was sup-
plying more iron ore than all the rest
of the country's sources That range is
now supplying half of the United Na-
tions' new fron The anniversary of the
opening of this vast commerce is to be
celebrated this month in Cleveland.
To people raised in and around the
Great Lakes, the colossal commerce sus-
tained there is an old story But Amer-
icans from other parts of the country
gasp with surprise when they first see
the line of big ships moving on that
waterway To watch those ships from
such a vantage point as the junction of
Lake St Clair and the Detroit River is
to comprehend in a fresh new manner
the Immense strength of this country
On a good day as many as four or five
ships are visible at a time moving with
their heavy loads of ore south toward
the lower lake ports
MORE SHIPS BUILDING
The anniversary this year is a good
time to contemplate the tremendous per-
formance of the lakes in this war The
newest of the ships, named after Irving
S Olds, chairman of the Unfred States
Steel Corp, has just gone anto service
This may be the last big lake ship built
by private industry for a long time, al-
though the Maritime Commission is build-
ing more But it is the leader of a great
fleet.
There are now in the ore trade 302
American ships, and 35 Canaolan freight-
ers are also hauling ore into our lake
ports In August they handled 13,235,863
tons of ore The July tonrage, which
was lights more, set a record In Sep-
tember, a shorter and foggier month, the
figure was 11,818 000 tons
The years goal is 90 000,000 Last year
the mark was 80 116,000 Lp to last week
the movement of ore was 72,441,000 tons
-somewhat over 10,000,000 above last
years mark of the same date
The Mesabi Range still has about
500,000,000 tons directly available in the
open pits War demands run around
75000,000 tons a vear At that rate, the
easily gathered ore will be gone by 1950
After that there is available a supply for
hundreds of years of lower grade ore,
the development of which will ultimately
require vast investment of capital and
emplov thousands of new workers
Five new ships of the Oids type have
been delivered this year to the Pittsburgh
Steamship Co, United States Steel, vessel
subsidiary. With their geared turbines
they are a new type of ship on the lakes
Their capacity depends somewhat upon
the level of the lakes There is a cycle
in lake levels like the cycles of the rab-
bit population in the north woods
This year the new ships are hauling
17,000 tons each, but with more water
they could haul 18000 tons. They make
the round trip from Duluth to Cleveland
in a little under six days
NATURE'S HEAVY HAND
On the Great Lakes, as in Russia,
Mother Nature wields a heavy band in
the destinies of war With the United
Nations there, as with Germany on the
steppes, it is a race with winter An early
winter on the lakes would be a disaster,
and about this time the people who live
on the lakes watch the signs from heaven
Normally the ice and fog and bitter winds
close up Lake Superior and Lake Huron
around Thanksgiving
This year some chances will have to
be taken, and there are sagas of heroism
and suffering on the lakes that rival the
great stories of the sea Everyone who
lived on Lake Erie at the time remembers
the terrific storm that swept down in
early November in, I belleve, 1913, strew-
ing death and wreckage everywhere The
lakes look small on the maps, but those
who live by them know and respect their
quick fury
The over all picture of this great ore
mining and carrying industry is one of
smooth and incredibly intelligent co-
ordination As with the railroads, a vast,
unsurpassed experience is serving expert-
ly and with constant improvement. With-
out the Mesabi Range, we might now be
suffering from a want of steel as well as
rubber There, locked in the heart of the
continent, is one resource safe from the
enemy
