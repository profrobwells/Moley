Second Guessing on Our Ingenuity
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Some time ago this column suggested
that a succession of hopeful official state-
ments with reference to the future supply
of civilian goods was a remarkable reversal
of the Spartan prediction of a year or so ago.
It was suggested that this disparity may
well be due to a failure by the government
to anticipate the productivity of this country.
It was also suggested that to prevent the
use of figures of civilian production for
political purposes, either for or against the
administration in power, a wholly impartial
and expert group or agency might well be
asked to straighten out the welter of guesses
now obtaining as to what we might expect of
production of civilian supplies.
The over-all statistics illustrate the great
confusion of this question, and, it may be
added, they also reflect the overall confusion
of administration. For bad administration
somehow gets itself reflected in the total
figures.
WRONG GUESSING
Back in the tense days shortly after Pearl
Harbor, the President made his first estimate.
It was a rule-of-thumb suggestion that, since
our potential national income for the fiscal
year 1942 was estimated at $100,000,000,000,
this sum should be equally dividedâ€”$50,000,000,000
for war goods, $50,000,000,000 for civilian
goods. Some days later the allocation for war
production was raised to $55,000,000,000, and
on Jan. 12, 1942, it was raised again to
approximately $59,000,000,000.
Washington thinking, obsessed by its mistaken
view that our economy is almost static, seemed
to assume that whatever was used for war
purposes would, in proportion, be taken from
civilian production. And so the guess was that
civilian net production would be $100,000,000,000
minus whatever there was of war production,
or somewhere between $40,000,000,000 and
$50,000,000,000.
What happened? The figures on the fiscal year
of which the President spoke are not yet
available, but the figures for the calendar year
serve to indicate how widely the President and
his helpers undershot the mark on civilian goods.
Civilian expenditures for 1942, according to
the Department of Commerce, went to about
$82,000,000,000. If, allowing for inflation, we
reduce these figures to 1939 dollars, civilian
expenditures were approximately $68,000,000,000.
This means that civilian expenditures in 1942
were approximately as high as in 1941, and
considerably higher than in 1940, even after
allowing for inflated prices.
WHAT TO DO NOW?
The remarkable thing about this is that it
occurred while great chunks of civilian goods
were taken out of production. Automobiles,
refrigerators and many other articles were
unavailable. But productivity greatly enlarged
in those lines which could be expanded. People
had money to spend, and despite manpower and
material problems, American ingenuity produced
things to buy.
Mr. Henderson, acknowledging his lack of
appreciation of this factor in 1942, said recently
that in the first quarter of 1943 the rate of
civilian production was running about
$90,000,000,000. He believes that the rate of
increase will level off and that 1943 will show
not over $90,000,000,000. But the expansive
factors still exist that threw his calculation askew
before.
The anticipation of this great flood of things to
buy is what may well be precipitating the brighter
news from the administration. The whole thing
provokes a vast speculation of causes, results and
conclusions altogether too lengthy for this space.
But the point is that once more the administration
has viewed American private enterprise with smoked
glasses. Its dilemma is that if it takes off the
glasses it will have nothing to distinguish itself,
for this sour view of American ingenuity and
resourcefulness is the basis of much of its economic
thinking.
