Giving Cheer
to Germany
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
That strikes and threats of
strikes help Germans maintain
their hope to escape defeat
would probably be granted by
all parties to the ine- labor,
employers and government. But
the exact manner in which such
things affects Germany can be
known only to those Germans
who have had the experience, a
plenty of evidence of past ex-
periences. The other day I asked
a distinguished German, now in
exile, for his opinion, and his
answer deserves quotation:
"To Germans, strikes in basic
war industries are almost un-
thinkable," he said. "An attempt
to stop the railways or to strike
in coal mines or steel mills
would, today in Germany, have
the immediate consequence that
not only the mines or factories
would be run by the military,
perhaps together with a Nazi
gauleiter, but that every strike-
ing laborer would lose his draft
exemption instantaneously, and
that the leaders of such a movement
would be shot at the latest
after 10 minutes' trial.
VITAL SUBSTANCES
"The German sees coal and
iron as absolutely vital for
every day of warfare. The idea
that oil can substitute for coal
cannot even occur to him; it is
too scarce in Europe for other
than military use. No German
would ever believe that we now
release steel for civilian purposes;
it is unthinkable for him
that even such a strike would
not ruin the American war effort,
the effect of which he now
sees directly in the ruins of
his smoldering cities.
"I well remember a bitter
story of the aftermath of the
first World War. A controversy
followed by some strike attempts
arose in 1918 in the Berlin-
Spandau ammunition industry.
The Social Democratic leaders
appeased the laborers. Several
years later, the mere fact
that Fritz Ebert, the Socialist
Reich's President, who had lost
two sons in the war, had spoken
at such a meeting was used
by the Nazis to pretend that he
had backed the strikers.
"Ebert proved that this was
a lie, but he suffered terribly
in the face of the accusation,
and his friends are convinced
that his death, following almost
immediately the exciting trial,
was partly caused by this reproach.
BRIGHT SPOT FOR NAZIS
"This is certainly not said to
discourage labor to improve
their wage position. I trust that
labor will find means to argue
its case without the spectacular
method of striking in essential
industries, which builds false
hopes in the bitterest enemies
of labor itselfâ€”the Nazis."
All of which suggests that
those who assume that Americans
knew all along that there
would be no railway strike and
that a strike vote was not really
a strike vote at all must
have forgotten the effect of that
vote on the literal German mind.
Over there the news, heavily
colored by propaganda, must
have been the first bright spot
in a weary year.
