Employment
Prospects
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The enormous gap between
the postwar employment de-
mands of labor and government
promises, on one hand, and the
sober opinions of independent
economists on the other, is a
matter of first importance. Its
implications can shake the care-
free optimism of those who
have been taking postwar pros-
perity for granted.
Last week the American Eco-
nomic Association met in Wash-
ington. Its discussions showed
a sudden turn in thinking to-
ward what people present called
"realism." They meant by this
a willingness to look postwar
employment figures in the face
and to recognize that deflation
is as likely to arrive as inflation
PRODUCING MORE
It was pointed out that in 1929
we had 48,000,000 employed and
less than 1,000,000 unemployed.
We produced (in dollar values
of 1939) about $86,000,000,000. In
1939 we employed 43,000,000
with 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 un-
employed. Labor hours were
about 15 per cent below 1929.
Yet we produced more than in
1929.
In 1944 our gross production
will reach (in 1939 prices) $165,-
000,000,000. But our labor force
will be only 54,000,000, with
11,000,000 in the armed forces.
So we are learning, under the
stress of war, to produce much
more per man. The engineers
have been turned loose and they
are performing miracles.
But those miracles will pro-
duce a terrific problem of balanc-
ing production, consumption and
employment after the war.
Therein lies the seriousness of
the prospect.
It was obvious at the meeting
that economists connected with
the so-called Hoffman committee
for economic development were
seeing these important figures
clearly. They made clear their
belief that leaders of industry,
as represented in the committee,
should be careful about promis-
ing even relatively full employ-
ment and that it would be most
unwise for management to as-
sume coresponsibility with la-
bor and government to that end.
'FULL EMPLOYMENT'
On the other hand, a group
of optimists, under the leader-
ship of the Department of Com-
merce, still seemed to anticipate
a miracle of consumption ahead,
which would bring the level of
consumption in 1946 almost two-
thirds higher than 1939. If that
happens the rate of increase
will have to be three times as
great as the normal rate from
1900 to 1939. And even if this
miracle is performed, employ-
ment will be only what it is
now, with the returning soldiers
unaccounted for except as re-
placements for the aged, the
youth and the women.
Those sober suggestions by
economists with no axes to
grind should warn us against
accepting the political slogan of
"full employment." That ex-
pression is a cruel deception.
