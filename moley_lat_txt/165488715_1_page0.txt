Let's Not Be
Duped Again
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The rumors have it that Hitler, perhaps in the hope of
getting better terms from the
United States and Great Britain,
plans to replace Ribbentrop with
Hjalmar Schacht as Foreign
Minister, which suggests once
more that one of Germany's not-
too-secret weapons to be used
in peace-making may be the
shopworn but still potent man
who was president of the Reichs-
bank from 1924 to 1930, Minister
of Economics and, again, head
of the Reichsbank from 1933
to 1938. The literal Germanic
mind may well reason that the
Schacht who fooled British and
Americans so successfully before
may do it again. Hence,
it is well that Americans learn
as much as possible now about
this Talleyrand of economics.
HISTORY OF SCHACHT
When, after the storm of inflation had passed in the '20's,
the mark was stabilized, Schacht,
a piously professing democrat,
became head of the Reichsbank.
His job then was to get American
loans which, in effect, provided
the means of paying German
reparations. He did it by
pretending that he was opposed
to unproductive loans, but he
took the money anyhow.
In 1930 the Young Plan was
arranged by Americans eager to
ease the burdens which Schacht
cleverly revealed to them. But
Schacht already felt the tide of
nationalism rising and was moving
his allegiance from the Democrats
to the Nazis. He kicked
up a big fuss over a comparatively
insignificant matter of
interest to embarrass his successor
in the Reichsbank, and
as a result Schacht came back
to the Reichsbank when Hitler
came to power.
AS GUILTY AS ANY
From then on Schacht devoted
himself to the financing of the
coming war. No form of chiseling
other nations was overlooked.
Schacht, on the record,
stands as guilty of preparing
the terror that broke loose in
1939 as Goering or Goebbels. In
preparations for war, by methods
too detailed to be described in
this space, it was made certain
that whatever capitalists earned
and whatever the laborers saved
was poured into government
paper.
When the preparations for war
were made and Hitler stripped
the Reich for action, Schacht's
work was done. He was removed
partly, perhaps, because
he wanted to bide his time until
the fighting was over. He was
not killed, as were others who
were out of favor, probably because
the Nazis wished this card
to play in peace negotiations.
No nation lost more because of
Schacht than the United States.
But he was able, for years, to
keep a fair supply of good will
among the British and Americans
who dealt with him.
Doubtless his manner of hearty
good will, which his victims admired
because it was so "un-German,"
accounts for this. The
show he managed to put up was
a good oneâ€”for him. But it
must not be revived.
