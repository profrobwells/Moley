The President
Tries a Punt
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Facing a Congress that for
months had crowded him closer
and closer to his goal posts, the
President, in his message, tried
a long punt. The game will be
played, for a while, in Congressional territory.
The move was based upon the
political calculation that the
President has lost real control
of Congress and that, before
many weeks, the Grim Reaper
may cut away the actual Democratic majority in the House.
WINDOW DRESSING
The Presidential message provides plenty of sentimentalism
as window dressing for national
service. Everybody, after he
has been duly signed, stamped
and inducted into the job he
has held right along, is supposed
to feel that for the first time he
is helping to win the war.
But the President can hardly
feel hopeful about action by
Congress, now that the pressure
has been considerably removed
from the labor supply. In industrial centers in the Middle West
and even on the West Coast, cut-backs are easing man power
strains considerably. The major
purpose in proposing national
service now, aside from the
strategic considerations mentioned above, must be its effect
upon enemy morale. It will
make good talking for O.W.I.
broadcasts, since recent strikes
and threats of strikes have, no
doubt, given Goebbels a theme.
The passage in the message
about a new Bill of Rights
seems to be almost wholly political confetti. What the President
misses is that when one
uses the concept of a right, he
must recognize a corresponding
obligation on the part of someone
to provide the thing to
which somebody else has the
right. If everyone has a right
to a job, then someone has to
provide the tools, the wages, and
the management. The right to
a job is not on all fours with
the right to freedom of speech.
WHAT HAPPENS?
In the latter case, the concept
means that if a man wants to
say something, he must not be
stopped by anyone, including
the government. If someone
does stop him, he appeals to the
law administered by the courts.
No one is compelled to provide
the speaker with a platform,
newspapers, or a radio station.
In the case of a job, what happens
to this "right"?
Does the President mean that
the holder of the "right" must,
in the long run, look to the government? If so, is government
to compel someone to provide a
job, or will it make a job out of
public funds?
The President may be approaching the latter conclusion,
but we have scarcely reached
the time when he can appropriately say that the country owes
every man a living.
He denies in his speech that
he covets the role of Santa
Claus. But if his new "rights"
are to be "implemented," Santa
Claus must be just around the
corner. And when he arrives,
national service will no doubt
freeze him to his job.
