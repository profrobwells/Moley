The Real Road
to Security
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As this column has already
suggested, any calculation of
our national wealth after the
war cannot depend upon static
figures of debt, depletion of hu-
man and inanimate resources,
and the like. Our wealth depends
upon the uses we make of our
resources.
When we turn to a considera-
tion of dynamic profit and loss
items, the postwar picture of
wealth is brighter. The pressure
of war has probably taught
American manufacturing les-
sons in efficiency that, in the
long reckoning, will more than
make up for losses in static
wealth.
MANY RECORDS
In aircraft production some
remarkable records of increased
efficiency have been established.
In December, 1940, in all the
Pacific Coast aircraft industry,
87,000 workers built 2000 planes
—a ratio of 43 to 1. In Decem-
ber, 1912, this ratio was 16 to 1.
In individual cases this general
increase in efficiency was great-
ly exceeded, and the maximum
ratio of efficiency is not yet in
sight.
The same situation applies to
many other manufacturing lines,
both in war and civilian goods.
In three years we have built a
war industry as large as the
entire industrial structure of
England, which was the prod-
uct of a century and a half of
effort.
It is inconceivable that the
methods devised for this remark-
able job, and the scientific and
technical discoveries that have
appeared, should not carry over
into the whole realm of manu-
facturing. Our postwar produc-
tive capacity could easily, and
probably will, considerably ex-
ceed our debt and war losses.
POSSIBLE CHECK
But a full utilization of this
potential wealth producing ca-
pacity depends, of course, upon
many conditions, mainly govern-
mental policies. If those policies
are to be directed by believers
in a scarcity economy, if empha-
sis is to be upon the division
of profits as yet unearned, if
our possibilities of expanding
foreign trade are to be ham-
pered, and if tax policies con-
tinue to prevent the initiation
of new businesses, the increase
of national wealth will be
checked—to what extent no one
knows.
A very real danger to the na-
tion’s wealth-producing capacity
lies in efforts that may be made
by government to perpetuate
some of the uneconomical situa-
tions created in the hurry of
war, to benefit certain localities.
For example, there will be po-
litical demands to expend gov-
ernment money in exploiting
low-grade or distant or “pock-
ety” supplies of ore in various
States. If the pressure for this
“political ore” is great enough,
it may well prevent us from
accepting the abundance of
other countries. And ore pro-
duction is only one of many ex-
amples of new special and waste-
ful interests that war will leave
us.
