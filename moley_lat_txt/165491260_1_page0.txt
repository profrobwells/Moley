Farley Fight
Helps Dewey
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The political significance of
the move to oust James A. Far-
ley from the chairmanship of
the New York State Democratic
Committee, Initiated by the
O'Connell machine in Albany, is
of national importance. And
while the immediate reaction is
to dismiss it as merely an intra-
party fight among Democrats,
obviously its real effect will be
upon the Dewey-Willkie contest
for the Republican nomination.
The facts of the case make
this unusual turn very clear.
The O'Connells are regarded in
New York as a suburban branch
office of Tammany. In 1938 and
in 1912, Dewey hit the O'Con-
nells much as Stalin is hitting
the Balkan satellites of Ger-
many. He regarded them as the
most flagrant example of ma-
chine politics in the opposition
party. At the moment Dewey is
directing an investigation aimed
at their control of affairs in Al-
bany County.
At this moment when the
Dewey-O'Connell fight is moving
forward, the O'Connells make a
move that places them in the
position of being the stalwart
defenders of New Dealism in
New York. In announcing they
have a candidate to supplant
Farley, they leave the inference
that Farley is anti-fourth term
and should no longer head the
party in New York.
WHITE HOUSE:
Any White House connection
with this move is not clear. It
was first reported that a high-
ranking Democrat in New York,
said to be David K. Niles, an as-
sistant to the President, who
was in New York City at the
time, had inspired the move,
since Mr. Niles is a friend of Mr.
Cullen, the O'Connells' candidate
against Farley. Mr. Niles and
Mr. Oscar Ewing, vice-chairman
for the national committee,
rushed in with a denial of any
interest in the chairmanship.
Their concern is understandable
since the establishment of
a direct Washington connection
with a move by the O'Connells
would open the way to a direct
contest between Washington
and Dewey on Dewey's own
ground, and under most favor-
able circumstances for Dewey.
But despite the Niles denial, the
sponsorship by O'Connell of a
move to purge Farley provides
a full cast, a setting and a plot
for Dewey to stage a big Dewey-
New Deal battle. It is hard to
see how people with the politi-
cal experience of the O'Connells
could have permitted this to
happen.
For Dewey, without making a
single move toward the nomina-
tion, may, by the use of his in-
vestigation of the O'Connell ma-
chine, present himself as a logical
opponent to Roosevelt. His
legal moves can be vastly more
impressive than speeches.
INNOCENT BYSTANDER
Farley's part in all this will
be that of an innocent bystand-
er, attacked out of hand by the
machine which Dewey has so
often denounced. The election
of Farley as State chairman
will, despite the O'Connells, de-
pend upon the action of Kelly,
boss of Brooklyn. If Kelly de-
cides to purge Farley he will be
joined by Flynn, boss of the
Bronx, and, in part, by Tam-
many. Thus, the great urban
machines of the State will be
put in the position of striking
down a conscientious objector
to the fourth term.
Farley, if purged, will be free
to fight the renomination of
Roosevelt, and to bolt, if Roose-
velt runs. If he is not purged
he will still be able to oppose
Roosevelt's renomination, either
to support Roosevelt or to re-
sign as State chairman. What-
ever happens, Dewey can now
become the champion of all anti-
New Deal Democrats by hitting
the O'Connells, who are the op-
ponents of the most beloved of
all anti-New Deal Democrats.
An amusing reflection on this
episode is that the O'Connells
were foremost in Chicago in
1932 among those who opposed
Roosevelt to the bitter end
nomination for him.
