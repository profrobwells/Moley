Retail Jobs
for Veterans?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Before bright hopes are built
upon suggestions of increased
retail sales as a means of providing new jobs for veterans and
warworkers, it may be well to
look at a few facts.
The Department of Commerce,
as well as Rep. Wright Patman's
small business committee, have
made some hefty claims for this
source of postwar employment.
In "Markets After the War," a
publication of the Department
of Commerce, a goal of $75,000,000,000 is set for postwar retail
sales volume. A division of the
Department of Labor and some
Congressmen suggest 1,000,000
more persons go into retailing.
This, Mr. Patman probably
thinks, is the answer to his
chain-store enemies.

SOME FIGURES
But before this remedy is to be
widely offered, perhaps to veterans, let us look at the probabilities. The highest prewar
figure of retail sales was $40,000,000,000 in 1929. The price level
then was about where it is now.
In 1933 the amount of retail
sales was down to almost half
that of 1929. In 1930 we were
somewhere above $40,000,000,000.
In 1942 we reached $58,000,000,000. The Department of
Commerce, wrongly anticipating
a big decline in civilian consumption, predicted $48,000,000,000
for 1943. The figure actually
reached was $63,000,000,000.
In retailing, employment in
1920 was 6,000,000 people. In
1939 6,250,000 were employed.
At present there may be a few
hundred thousand more. Where,
we may well ask, are to be the
1,000,000 additional jobs and the
12,000,000,000 additional dollars
of sales?
We shall certainly need many
more retail employees in stores
after the war. But we shall
probably need fewer restaurant
employees. The prospect for
1,000,000 more is not good. It is
very doubtful, indeed. Moreover, the risks that attend small
retail businesses have been
proved to be very great.

RANKS FILL UP
The 20th Century Fund, in a
reliable book, says: "At least
three-quarters of new retail enterprises died of malnutrition or
were buried by the bankruptcy
court." Walter L. Mitchell of
Dun and Bradstreet wrote in
1941: "An estimated 260,000
underprivileged retailers disappear from the scene each year,
yet the ranks always seem to be
promptly filled with new recruits and, in the last seven
years, births exceeded deaths.
So the figures of $75,000,000,000
in sales and 1,000,000 new jobs
are highly dubious. If we succeed in maintaining the $49,000,000,000 sales figure of 1929 and
maintain the present figure of
employment we shall be doing
well. Certainly, no agency or
officer of government should be
a party to recommending to veterans that they stake their savings on such a prospect.
