'Government
by Veto'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We are having in Washington
an unusual form of government.
It might be called government
by veto. Instead of co-operation
between the executive and the
legislative, we have a premium
on conflict. Instead of compro-
mise, we have a series of explo-
sive acts of lawmaking, fol-
lowed by equally explosive ve-
toes. The President, upon whom
rests the major responsibility
for this condition, seems deter-
mined to tell the country the
parliamentary part of our sys-
tem is a failure.
During most of the war pe-
riod, we have had inflation con-
trol from veto to veto. In Octo-
ber, 1942, after a sharp rebuk-
by the President, Congress en-
acted a measure to freeze price
and wages. It was apparently
what the President wanted, but
it froze neither prices nor wages
CONGRESS REVOLTS
Six months later, John L
Lewis demanded a wage boost
This was in effect temporarily
vetoed by the President. At the
same time the farm bloc de-
manded an increase of farm
prices. This demand, embodied
in the Bankhead bill, was ve-
toed.
Then came the promise to
roll back prices by subsidies
But the arguments advanced
for this step were so obviously
bad that the common sense of
Congress revolted.
The chief danger in the ex-
treme demand for subsidies by
the President was that all sub-
sidies—even the workable and
legitimate ones—were endan-
gered in the Congressional re-
volt. Finally, when Congress
provided an act, punishing sub-
sidies, but extending the life of
the Commodities Credit Corpora-
tion, the President vetoed it.
The life of the C.C.C. is still in
danger, although it is clearly
necessary to agricultural sta-
bility.
It begins to look as if the
President proposes to make of
the coming election a contest
between the two branches of
government rather than between
two responsible national parties.
Nothing could be more unfor-
tunate. And nothing could be
more utterly at odds with the
President's claim, in 1932, that
he should be elected because he
could accomplish what Mr.
Hoover was failing to do—
namely, get along with Congress.
HERE IS AN ISSUE
So here is an issue for the
campaign, and Gov. Dewey, in
his Lincoln Day speech, clearly
stated it. Are we, in the making
of peace, to start out with the
proposition that whatever the
President wants, Congress will
oppose, and that whatever Con-
gress wants, the President will
oppose? Is the fourth-term ar-
gument to be to vote no con-
fidence in Congress?
If the voters follow the Pres-
ident and give him a workable
Congressional majority, we
shall have a House controlled
by superannuated chairmen and
raw, green members.
Perhaps that is the kind of
legislative incompetence the
President wants. But the voters
may decree something else. Nei-
ther government by veto nor
government by rubber stamp is
in the American tradition.
