Harold Ickes, evidently not
content with the confusion cre-
ated by his Arabian pipe dream,
has tossed out another still more
fantastic scheme. War plants,
after the war, should be turned
over to the men and women in
the armed forces, he thinks.
This, he says, would give them
a stake in the future of democ-
racy.
Considering the fact that all
industrial enterprise is a mix-
ture of success and failure, Sec-
retary Ickes' scheme would give
those who served in the armed
forces most of the failures and
little of the success, of the fu-
ture. After 11 years of vivid ex-
perience, men of imagination
are fairly indifferent to ways
of crackpotism but this pro-
posal is pure burlesque.
Ickes does not favor govern-
ment ownership of the war
plants because straight social-
ism has apparently always been
too systematic and rational for
Mr. Ickes' inventive mind. Nor
should the plants, he says, be
turned over to private capital-
ists. They are too timid, he be-
lieves. Instead, we should re-
ward our soldiers, sailors, Wacs
and Waves with plants whose
usefulness will end with the
war.
JUST CONSIDER—
A consideration of what these
plants are designed to make re-
veals the full scope of Mr.
Ickes' generosity. First, there
are the shipyards. These are
mostly gigantic wharves, with
machinery and subsidiary plants
designed to turn out specific
types of ships needed in this
war—ships that will be out-
dated when the war is over.
There will be hundreds of ships
on hand when the war ends,
with commercial needs for only
a relatively few.
Then there will be aircraft
factories. The demand for air-
craft will go down to about 5
per cent of present levels. What
chance would a group of re-
turned soldiers have against the
experienced competition of our
present managers, designers and
engineers?
Then there are emergency
steel plants. Consider the head-
aches of an inexperienced group
of veterans turning out steel
for a shrinking market against
the competition of the steel in-
dustry that entered the war.
AND FURTHERMORE—
And there are chemical plants
with rather low man power re-
quirements, but with very large
capital investments. Shall the
veterans be expected to con-
tinue to manufacture explosives,
or shall they compete against
companies holding thousands of
ironclad patents and secret proc-
esses?
The fact that a Cabinet mem-
ber should make such a pro-
posal is one more piece of evi-
dence to show the feeble ideol-
ogy of the New Deal in its old
age—one more indication of
how irresponsible it has be-
come.
