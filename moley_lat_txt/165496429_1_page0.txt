The Proposed
Stock-Pile Idea
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This Congress will probably
see the birth of no little agita-
tion for the creation of stock
piles of raw materials of various
sorts, especially of critical
metals. As labor cut-backs be-
come more pronounced the de-
mand will increase. And, as
always, Representatives of
States in which such materials
are produced will join in the
agitation, just to keep things
humming at home. The stock-
pile idea also seems to present
sufficient resemblance to the
made-work idea to win the sup-
port of those New Dealers who
see no future for employment
except jobs at government ex-
pense.
Since the Great Lakes region,
concerned as it is with ore pro-
duction, is extremely sensitive
to matters of this sort, there has
been much talk of stock piles
there.
SOME OBJECTIONS
Russell Welsman of the Cleve-
land Plain Dealer points to a
number of arresting objections
to a broad program of stock-
piling now. He says that if the
proposal to keep production of
certain raw materials going is
offered merely to maintain em-
ployment, it is a surrender to
the psychology of depression be-
fore we know whether there is
to be a depression.
A superficial look at the sub-
ject brings to light the fact that
we might very well have armed
ourselves more quickly if we
had created vast stock piles of
critical materials before the war.
This point is made in the case
of rubber. Back in 1933, there
were extremely attractive pro-
posals to our government to
bring in great quantities of
manganese from Russia in re-
turn for manufactured articles.
That proposition, however, was
based upon the fact that Russia
wanted goods and had no money,
and we wanted orders for heavy
goods.
But current proposals are not
on all fours with this Russian
proposal. The powerful forces
behind them will be those whose
purpose is to make work in the
production of raw materials. It
will have no appreciable effect
in the manufacturing industries.
Its ultimate effect would be to
produce depression conditions
later, at a time when the result
would be the more serious be-
cause of surplus labor in other
fields.
MILITARY NEEDS
The situation is one in which
general planning is indicated.
Certain raw materials may well
be set aside for future military
needs; others had best be
omitted from calculation. Such
plans should be made with mil-
itary needs as the sole consid-
eration. To mix with any such
proposals spurious arguments
about prices and employment
is to repeat the chief fallacies of
New Dealism, in which taxation
and borrowing and military plans
are mingled with social and eco-
nomic reform.
As we all know to our sorrow
such mixing produces neither
reform, recovery nor military
preparedness.
