No Comfort
for Willkieites
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From here on, bits of news
will give more substance to speculation about the Republican
candidates for the nomination.
For speculation alone is not
news, nor are the speeches of
candidates, nor the claims of the
managers. When voters vote
and State conventions pledge, we
have something solid to go on.
New Hampshire has had a primary and North Carolina has
had a convention. In New Hampshire there were elected six
delegates pledged to Willkie and
two pledged to Dewey. Three
were unpledged.
WANING STRENGTH
This result cannot be encouraging to Willkie supporters,
for it indicates something less
than overwhelming Willkie
strength in New England. Good
reporters of sentiment say Dewey
is less strong in New England
than anywhere else. It has also
been assumed Willkie's strongest
base is New England.
But the New Hampshire vote,
in addition to a number of other
indications, shows waning Willkie
strength in New England.
In Vermont, for example, Gov.
Wills is ardently pro-Willkie.
But in a newspaper poll of the
Vermont Legislature, 16 Senators and 118 House members
voted for Dewey, as against 7
Senators and 42 House members
for Willkie.
These factors, added to a number of informed opinions from
Massachusetts and Connecticut,
make it seem to me that Willkie
can hardly count on more than
50 of New England's 92 delegates. That is not the sort of
strength that portends a Willkie
nomination on the first ballot.
It simply underlines the hard
fact that Willkie's road to the
nomination is going to be against
serious odds.
IMPORTANT NEWS
The Republican State Convention in North Carolina on March
14 voted unanimously for "drafting Dewey." This came after a
number of seemingly authoritative stories from that State that
the Republicans were going to
split their 25 votes at Chicago
two or three ways. Apparently
Republican leaders down there
have abandoned their cautious
attitude and have decided the
sentiment for Dewey represents
an authentic bandwagon. The
instincts of politicians are not
always a reliable index of things
to come, yet they must be taken
into account.
In brief, the politicians of New
England, instead of betting all-
out on Willkie, are beginning to
hedge, and the politicians of
North Carolina, instead of hedging, are going all-out for Dewey.
This news is important to consider in all calculations.
