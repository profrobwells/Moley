The Arabian
Pipe Dream
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Most of the oilmen who care
to discuss the Arabian pipe line
sponsored by Mr. Ickes make
it clear the project is not an
economic measure, but a ques-
tion of international political
policy. The presidential reports
of the heads of big American oil
companies are full of this opin-
lon. James Moffett, who knows
oll, is blistering in his attacks
upon Mr. Ickes.
Some time ago it became clear
the project was not a military
necessity for this war. The
building of the project would
require a year and a half. But,
after having won frail support
for the Arabian proposal on eco-
nomic or win-the-war grounds,
its defenders are now falling
back upon, mysterious sugges-
tions of long-range foreign pol-
icy. This is apparently what
the proposal has involved from
the start. And this is why the
thing is so serious.
WHAT IS REASON?.
Henry Taylor, in a highly in-
formative series of articles in
the New York World-Telegram,
has supplied many of the details
that begin to make the project
understandable. He makes it
clear, the contention of some ex-
ponents of the pipe line that it
is a project promoted by the
Army and Navy is not tenable.
The high officers of both serv-
ices know it is not their function
to make foreign policy. It is
merely their function to shape
their plans to meet the needs of
long-range foreign policy.
Nor would it be the function
of Mr. Ickes to promote the for-
eign policy of the generations
ahead. But if Mr. Ickes is acting
under the direction of the White
House, it is time a pretty clear
exposition of the purpose of the
project be made to the public.
And then there should be public
debate. which should precede,
not follow, the election.
The pipe line is apparently to
be a great government property,
whose protection might well
take the armed might of our
nation, presumably in alliance
with Great Britain, into one of
the most dangerous corners of
the world.
A QUESTION
The more candid exponents of
the plan say the way to co-
operate internationally is to
project our national honor and
interest into such spot as an
initial step. Then our co-opera-
tion will be a necessity.
With whom are we to co-oper-
ate?.
With Great Britain, as a mat-
ter of course, since British
sovereignty will extend to the
Eastern Mediterranean.
. But the Russian angle on this
Arabian pipe line is not so clear.
If the project means a threat to
Russia, the co-operation of that
nation can hardly be expected.
In case of trouble with Russia,
no one should expect the frail
barriers between the Soviet and
the pipe line to resist the world's
greatest land power.

A THOUGHT FROM THE BIBLE
As coals are to burning coals,
and wood to fire; so is a conten-
tious man to kindle strife.â€”
