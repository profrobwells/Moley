What of the
Home Front?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While the Battle of Europe
proceeds, a lot of people other
than those who are fighting are
going to be making history.
Old-timers will tell of what
their fathers said of the anxious
days during the Battle of Get-
tysburg in 1863. One of them
tells of how his grandmother
sat on the porch in Perry Coun-
ty, Pennsylvania, listening to
the guns beyond the mountains
and wondering which army
would be coming through the
pass near the house. Men left
their farms and rushed to town
to hear the news. Some of them
stayed away from home for days.
THE HOME FRONT
This time it will not be a
matter of days until we know
definitely how it is all coming
out, but weeks and probably
months. What happens on the
home front during these weeks
and months will mean a great
deal to the men who return
from the great battle. In fact,
what has happened in the past
months and weeks will have a
grave bearing on the whole fu-
ture of these men. And since
we cannot help them in the bat-
tle with much except our
prayers, we may well give some
thought to responsibilities over
here.
People will recall the Brew-
ster sit-in affair and draw the
simple conclusion that if we
were unprepared for the shut-
down of one plant, we are not
prepared for victory. We still
have a thousand planners with-
out a plan.
People will recall that on in-
vasion day it was revealed in
Washington that Messrs. Baruch
and Hancock had resigned three
weeks before, their posts as
chairman and vice-chairman, re-
spectively, of the war mobiliza-
tion unit of postwar adjust-
ment, and that Baruch commit-
tee officials were severely criti-
cal of the failure of the W.P.B.
to anticipate the Brewster sit-
uation.
WHAT DID WE DO?
People will recall also that a
week before invasion a confer-
ence was held to consider post-
war problemsâ€”a conference at
which a number of professors
and others expounded their the-
ories of postwar economics. Prof.
Einstein, for instance, sent a
message calling for life security
for the millions of "intellectu-
als," and white-collar workers.
A Harvard astronomer, who
was the first speaker at the
meeting, voiced the helpful sug-
gestion that our social worries
would be solved while the
planet Pluto was making its
next 250-year trip around the
sun.
So the stargazing goes on at
home, while Americans abroad
are facing the blinding flashes
of guns. Our soldiers, sailors,
marines and airmen are going
to ask us, one day, what we are
doing during this new Gettys-
burg. Did we, like great-grandpa,
leave the farm and go to town,
breathless, to hear the news?
Or were we spouting meaning-
less balderdash about employ-
ment while a single factory had
to be given made-work to tide
over workers who were sorely
needed in 10,000 other places?
