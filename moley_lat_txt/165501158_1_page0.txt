Employment
Found at Peak
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 1.—The
peak of employment has been
reached in the two great industries
on the Coast—aircraft and
shipbuilding. In the case of
ships the peak is past, and the
decline has started. In the aircraft
plants in the Los Angeles
area the reports are that employment
has been “stabilized”—that
is, people are not being
taken on except as replacements.
Some plants report that this will
not affect over-all production.
The fact is that due to increased
efficiency and the standardization
of design production will
go on increasing for a time, depending
upon the fortunes of
war. But the lush days are on
the wane, and people should not
be migrating here looking for
easy and highly remunerative
jobs in war industries.
The problem of unemployment
that everybody has been thinking
about in these cities is right
around the corner. But it is not
catching these cities unprepared.
City plans are under way to provide
for employment and necessary
city improvements. I have
seen and studied such plans in
Portland, San Francisco and
here in Los Angeles. They have
several features in common.
FUTURE FOR PORTS
Most of them take account of
the fact that there will be an
extensive exodus from these
cities by dismissed workers.
Tens of thousands will go home,
and home, to many, is the State
in which they are now employed.
Other thousands have saved
enough for the little place in the
country that they have dreamed
about for years. (Small places
with gardens or a few acres of
productive land are in great demand.)
For others, spring will
set in motion a considerable reserve
migration. Oklahoma, Texas,
Kansas and Nebraska will be
calling.
But seaports on the West
Coast will employ more people
than before 1940. The Japanese
war will go on for some time,
and shipping to Russia, Australia
and China will keep many busy.
A considerable belief exists here
that shipbuilding yards can be
converted into essential plants
for embarkation, for stevedoring
and for naval repairs. Beyond
the Japanese war will be an increase
in commerce with the
Far East—probably not as much
as some optimists believe, but
considerable. In any event, for
many years to come these ports
will be servicing the greatest
navy the world has seen.
ESSENTIAL WORKS
But as Robert Moses of New
York told the people of Portland,
no one has a right to assume that
there will be full employment in
such activities. And those who
foolishly promise that the bounty
of Federal works projects
will suffice are deluding themselves.
Certainly they are not
deluding the people out here.
One of the most striking features
of the thinking of those who are
planning out here is their great
skepticism about the visions of
Washington planners for full employment
on Federal money.
For the first time in many
years an amazing conservatism
pervades the Coast. States are
fairly well fixed with surpluses,
and cities are better off than they
have been for a long time. The
main idea here now is to start
local works that are essential
first. Sewers before parks and
street lamps before monuments.
There is a lot the whole country
can learn from the common
sense of these places. The chief
lesson is that postwar unemployment
is not a big over-all national
problem defined in terms
of gross millions of unemployed.
It is a matter of individual
community planning for the
things that the community can
afford, and of articulating this
as well as possible, with improvements
by private enterprise
such as railroads, to avoid, except
as a last resort, a begging
line of mayors, governors and
chamber of commerce officials
at some Washington money-
spending bureau.
These States want to solve
their own problems in their own
way.
