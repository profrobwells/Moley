Our Outlook
on Taxes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For the benefit of those thou-
sands who said last week that
even Einstein couldn't fill out
the government's tax blank, let
it be said that Einstein didn't.
The learned doctor said in an
interview at Princeton that he
hired a philosopher to fill it out
for him.
Perhaps paying this year's tax
has made philosophers of us all.
At any rate, philosophy is about
all we have after taxes are paid,
so let's make the most of it.
The first thing that a bit of
thinking about taxes should re-
call to us is the silliness of those
who seem to believe that taxes
can make prosperity. Running
through all New Deal tax discus-
sion back to 1936, when Mr.
Roosevelt borrowed Huey
Long's tax ideas, is the refrain
that if the tax burden could
only be shifted about consider-
ably a flood of prosperity would
result.
LITTLE RELIEF
This, of course, cannot be true,
for to pile up taxes on a small
group does not make those who
are exempt work harder or pro-
duce more. Until recently the
vast numbers who paid no in-
come taxes were simply not con-
scious of taxes at all. Shifting
the burden to them is a means
of getting more revenue, but it
produces no more goods. Nor
does it do anything except lower
the living standard.
Speaking recently on postwar
prospects, Senator Taft said a
number of things that make
sense, although they offer little
comfort to us. He sees no pros-
pect of much relief after the
war, what with the billions add-
ed to the debt; the support of a
larger Army and Navy, unpre-
dictable veterans' benefits, social
security and the like. The im-
port of what he said was that
all activities and businesses
built upon the patronage of large
incomes will be blightedâ€”from
private colleges to luxury shops.
TWO FUNDAMENTALS
Most important of all, he
warns us against belief in the
specious philosophy that social
security is a means of piling up
national wealth in one period for
use in a future period. Values
cannot thus be saved by a na-
tion.
There are two fundamentals,
therefore, for those who would
build a philosophy of taxation:
First, you cannot make pros-
perity by any form of taxation,
however ingenious.
Second, the nation cannot
build future social security by
what the nation pays now. The
future may have to pay for the
past, but the present cannot pay
for the future.
