Bankruptcy
on 'Points'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A bit of investigation in the
middle western city in which
this is written reveals some new
theories and economic laws for
our savants. For the agonizing
efforts of the O.P.A. to prevent
inflation have brought to light a
brand new form of insolvency,
which may be called "point
bankruptcy." Out of my reflections
on the situation, I make
bold to suggest for economists
a new law of inflation.
In this city, during the period
in which the point system of
rationing has been in operation,
a number of meat men, wholesale
and retail, have gone bankrupt
in points. In view of the
low rate of commercial failures
these days, it is probable that
point bankruptcy is now more
common than money bankruptcy.
We can put down the
note that when better methods
of failure are built, there will
always be some who will use
them.
PLIGHT OF A DEALER
A certain meat dealer in these
parts has been telling his customers
that he is short in excess
of 75,000 points. One of them
inquired of the O.P.A. and found
that the dealer had an actual
deficit of only about 25,000
points, but this has been enough
to put him in the hands of the
O.P.A.'s enforcement division.
He is pleading with customers
to advance him some points, particularly
with those to whom he
has been generous, but such is
the state of gratitude in the
modern breast that some of his
customers have begun cultivating
other dealers.
He explains his plight by saying
that he has too many men
customers. The men "just
wouldn't be bothered." Women,
this dealer believes, are more
honest in little things.
Ordinarily, this particular
meat dealer might compound
his debt with the O.P.A. and get
some new working capital in
points. It is suspected, as a
matter of fact, that he did this
some time ago. If he could turn
his business over to creditors in
the ordinary manner, they
might work him out or he might
go to the courts and be discharged
of his obligation. But,
under the point system, there is
no such thing as a bankruptcy
bath. It appears to be permanent
or for the duration.
In the city where this dealer
lives, the O.P.A. office admits a
deficit of about 1,000,000 points!
Considering that one wholesaler
there went bust for more than
1,000,000 points, this low figure
seems remarkable. It actually
consists of a series of small deficits
of about 80,000 points for
butter, for example, and this
might be lost or missed in one
Saturday's confusion.
'KITING' POINTS
Just how pitiable is the fix
this middle western dealer is in
will depend somewhat, one suspects,
upon the true state of
points-finance in his city. If the
deficit is as low as 1,000,000, the
O.P.A. could close him out. But
if too many dealers are in hock
pointwise, something in the nature
of an amnesty or jail delivery
would have to be arranged.
Otherwise the public would run
out of stores.
An unforeseen source of the
civic deficit in this city has come
from dealers who use up their
points and kite them with their
wholesalers before they close
their shops and are drafted. One
such dealer was drafted owing
30,000 points. The O.P.A. could
no more get a points-judgment
against a man in the Army than
the ordinary creditor can for
money.
Thus, to all the talk about
money inflation in this country,
we can add that there are traces
of point inflation, not unlike the
inflation which occurred in priorities
before the controlled-materials
system was set up in the
war production.
On the basis of the facts shown
in this article, I suggest a new
law of inflation for the money
theorists. Whenever paper is
designed to represent commodities,
we can have inflation. We
set up, in this case, point-money
to prevent money inflation. Now
we have inflation in point-
money.
