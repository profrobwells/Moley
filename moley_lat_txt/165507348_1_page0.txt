The O.P.A.
Meat Mix-up
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Under date of May 6, Chester
Bowles, price administrator, said
in Collier's: "Meat rationing
will be with us for several
months after the war in Europe."
On May 3 Mr. Bowles
ended rationing on all meats
except beef steaks and roasts.
It takes some time to put Collier's
through the press, of
course, but even a month or six
weeks ago Mr. Bowles' prophecy
department should have been
operating more efficiently.
For months everyone who
knew the facts has been blasting
away at the O.P.A. with incontestable
evidence of rising meat
surpluses. Huge numbers of
hogs, sheep and cattle have stood
in open view on the farms. But
the bureaucracy which Messrs.
Bowles and Vinson direct refused
to see or hear.
SUBSIDIES PAID
Ridiculous subsidies were paid
to keep prices low, although natural
means of control could have
been made available had they
been released. We pay government
money in the form of rollback
subsidies to keep meat
prices to the consumer low, and
yet pay other government
money to support and keep meat
prices to the farmer high!
In spite of the rapid disappearance
of Leon Henderson's
nightmare about an "inflationary
gap," Messrs. Bowles and
Vinson reported in February
that inflation was just around
the corner and would devour us
all if their special price formulas
did not receive the approval of
Congress. But wise businessmen
and economists advised the
administration over and over
that a fatal glut of livestock
would break down prices and
storage facilities by the fall of
1944.
WHEN, OH, WHEN?
Against all such cautions, Mr.
Bowles was able to write in the
Collier's article, mentioned
above, the following: "Recently
the Canadian government temporarily
removed meat from rationing.
That caused a lot of
people in this country to think
that O.P.A. would take the same
action. The situation in this
country and Canada, however, is
totally different. Canada suffers
from critical lack of storage
and shipping facilities. Its
government took meat off rationing
to prevent spoilage. In the
United States we are able to
move meat to the consumer
without hindrance from rationing
machinery.
"Meat rationing will be with
us for several months after the
end of the war in Europe."
When will the logic of natural
laws be accepted by this bureaucracy?
