New Deal's
Yearning
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the Democratic National
Committee should be willing to
publish the full proceedings of
its recent meeting in Washing-
ton, the careful reader would
draw from it the impression that
James A. Farley is the party's
indispensable man.
I am sure that the small offi-
cial group which swings a big
whip over the party did not
plan it that way. But they labor
under the difficulty that, while
the party is directed by who-
ever happens to be using the
White House telephone, the
horny handed, who run it in
the States, still love Farley. And
when these "prisoners" get a
chance to talk in a party con-
clave, their memories go back
to greener fields, clear streams
and to Farley.
FARLEY'S POSITION
They want him back, of
course. But Farley's answer is
that he has never been away—
from the party. And never hav-
ing left the party, he doesn't
need to come back. Only—and
this is important—he hasn't
changed his mind about the real
issue of a permanent President,
and when the convention comes
around his position will still be
unchanged.
It was really a badly staged
and sadly managed affair, this
national committee meeting.
Think of a dominant party coun-
cil, meeting in the capital of the
nation, betraying its dire need
of a man who is publicly known
to be out of sympathy with its
leadership and policies. It is as
if a champion on the eve of a
title fight should announce that
he could not win unless he got
back a trainer who was far away
and would not return. What
would that do to the betting
odds?
The resolution of the commit-
tee, unanimously adopted, was
monumental ineptitude. With a
strong group of Middle Western
members bitterly opposed to the
administration's home-front pol-
icies, the committee limited its
statement on domestic matters
to a few words in a total of some
hundreds.
POOR NEW DEAL!
Where is the great crusade
formerly known as the New
Deal? As in the case of dead
Caesar, there was none so poor
as to do it reverence. Instead,
the committee told American
voters not to let down "the Brit-
ish, the Soviet Union and the
Chinese republic," for, by im-
plication, millions of those na-
tionals are yearning for a fourth
term.
Robert E. Hannegan, modest-
ly professing himself no big
leaguer, was chosen leader. His
experience in politics was seem-
ingly limited to a part of the
Missouri Democratic machine,
which has not done so well in
late years. If, as is reported,
the party intends to place him
on a salaried basis, this, in it-
self, suggests the subordinate
role which he will occupy.
No wonder the advice of Far-
ley is sought! But the advice he
would give might be that the
party should have a free conven-
tion. That, it needs no saying,
is not in prospect.
