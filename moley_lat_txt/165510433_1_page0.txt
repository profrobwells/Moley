Al Smith's
Firm Stand
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While I make it no part of
my business to deal in prophecy,
here is one for the book. Al
Smith will most certainly not
support President Roosevelt for
a fourth term. Rumors that he
would have been going around.
These, Gov. Smith disdains
to answer, for Smith belongs
to the old-fashioned school of
public men who get into no
arguments with shaky rumors.
His philosophy is this: friends
will not believe rumors; ene-
mies will believe anything. So
why bother?
Al Smith is sound, cie-
headed and active. He has stood
firmly over the years for a good
many fine and lasting political
principles. The New Deal has
not been on the list. It will remain
be in the future.
SHREWD APPRAISAL
Moreover, Smith has been a
shrewd appraiser of the public
figures of his time. He knew
Mr. Roosevelt over a long
series of years. He recognized
many aspects of his friend's ca-
pacity. But he considered Mr.
Roosevelt inadequate for the
Presidency. Smith's opposition
to the Roosevelt nomination in
1932 has been ascribed to his
own ambition for another try
at the Presidency. But Smith's
growing opposition to the New
Deal, which culminated in 1936
in a bolt from his party even
though everyone knew that
Landon would not win, was
born of no personal ambition.
It was a matter of deeply felt
concern for the interest of his
country. Smith has that concern
still.
One fact can be held firm
by the thousands of Americans
who have been disturbed by re-
ports of Al Smith's reconciliation
tion with the current adminis-
tration. That fact is that when
a man has made a fateful choice
such as that of Smith in 1936,
he has a durable obligation to
those thousands who respected
that choice and the integrity be-
hind it. Al Smith is not the man
to let those people down.
HIS RECORD
A statesman at 70, moreover,
has a rendezvous with those
whose youthful principles we
shaped around the facts in his
public life. He represents the
freedom of opportunity that per-
mits a man of meager begin-
nings to reach the high altitude
of public position.
His life has proved that religious
bigotry is self-defeating, for
some of those States that de-
feated him in 1928 on religious
grounds now wish that he had
been nominated in 1932 instead
of the man who was nominated.
The history of the public poli-
cies he has supported proves
that socially enlightened legis-
lation can be reconciled with
sound public finance and free
enterprise. And, in his four
terms as Governor, he proved
that a warmhearted humanitarian
can also be an efficient ad-
ministrator of public business.
Smith once spoke of Grover
Cleveland as a "great rock in
a weary land." Al Smith de-
serves that description on his
own account now.
