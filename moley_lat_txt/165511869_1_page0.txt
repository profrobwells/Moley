Finnish Choice
a Hard One
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is an old saying in Scan-
dinavian countries that when a
joke is told to a Dane, a Swede,
a Norwegian and a Finn, the
Finn is always the last to catch
the point. Perhaps that is be-
cause living at the top of the
world is no joke. Certainly, the
present Finnish predicament is
a serious matter and grows no
better with delay.
had an excellent grasp of human
nature. She won the love of
America by paying her debts. It
was my responsibility, in 1933,
to act for the President and the
State Department in negotia-
tions with the debtor countries.
Realizing that debt reductions
were probably necessary and in-
evitable, we decided American
opinion would be more sympa-
thetic if we started reductions
with Finland. But our plans
came to grief because Finland
refused. She said she wanted no
reduction. She preferred to pay.
And pay she did. All the rest of
our debtors defaulted.
THE HARD FACTS
The Finnish debt payments
were a good investment, how-
ever, because, after two years of
war, it is difficult to get Amer-
icans to realize the Finns are
fighting for the enemy. That
remains true, despite the facts
that German planes based on
Finland have drowned American
sailors in the icy waters of the
Arctic and that every Russian
killed by the Finns may mean
another American death on the
western fronts. These hard
facts are what Americans must
realize, in spite of all their sym-
pathy for Finland, her culture
and her present desperate plight.
If Finland can be induced to
quit the war, whatever the re-
action of Germans may be, the
Finns will, in the long run,
have the affection and sympathy
of the United States. And that
will be something, even if this
country finds it impossible to
control Russia's final settlement
with Finland. Only specula-
tions are possible as to what
that settlement will be.
FINLAND'S CHOICE
The best guess is that Finland
will get about the same deal
from Russia that she got after
the war in 1940. There is no
reason to believe Russia intends
to absorb all of Finland. There
are several reasons, on the con-
trary, why Russia probably will
not.
In the first place, Secretary
Hull must know Russia's inten-
tions toward Finland. And he
would hardly urge her to get out
of the war if he were not fairly
sure that Finnish independence
was to be respected.
The issue before Finland is to
get out now. The risk from
Germany is far less than the
risk of an ultimate Russian in-
vasion. For Russia can attack
by land, and Germany now must
cross the water.
