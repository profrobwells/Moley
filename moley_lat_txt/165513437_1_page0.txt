What About
Negro Vote?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The aging Democratic major-
ity in the House continues to
produce by-elections which show
an increasing tide against the
New Deal. The first day of
March brought some more by-
election returns in New York
State, also news of the death
of Rep. T. H. Cullen, a New
Deal faithful-to-the-end, which
means another by-election be-
fore long.
The contest in the 21st New
York District was between a Re-
publican named William S. Ben-
net and James H. Torrens, a
Tammany faithful, who asked
for election on the ground that
he would stand by the President.
Torrens was elected by the nar-
row margin of 1571 votes, which
was 7 per cent of the light vote
cast. Joseph A. Gavagan, for-
mer holder of the seat, was
elected in 10-12 by 20.792 votes
or 66 per cent of the vote cast.
This reversal cannot be ascribed
to the light vote, because it
may be assumed that Tammany
worked as hard as ever to get
out its vote.
NEGRO DISTRICT
The national significance of
the vote is found in a break-
down of the sections of this
variegated district. When the
traveler enters New York on the
New York Central, the train
turns away from the Hudson
River at Spuyten Duyvil and
follows the Harlem River, which
divides Manhattan from the
Bronx. The traveler, if he has
a seat and is facing the loco-
motive and if the window is not
too grimy, sees at his right,
until he reaches 125th St., the
estimable domain known as the
21st Congressional District. That
district, for the purpose of State
representation, is divided into
five Assembly districts.
One of these, the 10th, begins
at 125th St. and Fifth Ave, and
stretches over the most authen-
tic Negro area in the United
States. This Assembly district
was, before Pearl Harbor, strong-
ly favorable to the President’s
foreign policy. It gave Roose-
velt 23,562 votes in 1940, Willkie
5335 votes. Also in 1942, it gave
Dewey a slight combined Demo-
cratic-American Labor party
vote.
THE LESSON?
In this present Congressional
by-election, this Assembly dis-
trict gave the Democrat-A. L. P.
candidate only 275 votes. It gave
his Republican opponent 400.
The lesson of this by-election
is that the voters were singularly
apathetic to the screams
of the candidate who pledged
his support in Congress to the
President. The vote was espe-
cially light among the Negroes
Those in the Negro Assembly
district who voted showed a tre-
mendous reversal of attitude
even as compared with 1912.
What the appeal of the Presi-
dent, running as the “economi-
emancipator” in 1941, will do is
not clear. But that he can ex-
pect a return to the lush ma-
jorities among Negroes which
marked 1936 and 1910 is pretty
doubtful. It looks as if heavy
suspicions had set in as to the
authenticity of economic emanci-
pation and parties of economic
emancipation,
