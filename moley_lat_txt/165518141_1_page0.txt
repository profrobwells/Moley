Arthur D. Whiteside, presi-
dent of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.,
and, until recently, vice-chair-
man of the War Production
Board, has for years been ac-
cepted in New Deal circles in
Washington as a "liberal" busi-
nessman. By that friendly note,
New Dealers mean they like to
have him aroundâ€”they can get
along with him. There aren't
many businessmen who, will put
up with them at all, so Mr.
Whiteside has a real distinction.
Therefore, we wonder now
many New Dealers are thinking
along the economic lines drawn
by Mr. Whiteside in a speech
the other day before the Ameri-
can Retail Federation. In this
speech Mr. Whiteside came out
squarely for strict government
controls over civilian produc-
tion for a three-year postwar
period. Under his plan, recon-
verted plants should be put on
a quota basis, and the output of
goods be held to the 1939 level.
Then, to keep higher prices from
following restricted production,
price controls would have to re-
main, and Messrs. Bowles and
Vinson would have to "work out
some basis for caring for higher
costs."
IS THIS "LIBERAL"?
Even companies in a restricted
area, with labor available and
with the community dependent
upon the companies' produc-
tion, would be restricted on the
grounds of equality of treat-
ment throughout the national
economy.
Well, well, well. Is this the
"liberal" business philosophy as
seen by New Dealers?
It is Mr. Wallace in reverse.
The Vice-President would whip
Mr. Sloan for planning for
"only" a $100,000,000,000 na-
tional income. Mr. Whiteside
would cut Mr. Sloan back to
$50,000,000,000.
Mr. Wallace excoriates busi-
ness "cartels" for restricting
production. Mr. Whiteside
would create a vast government
strait jacket to do what car-
tels attempt on a limited scale.
But Mr. Whiteside and Mr.
Wallace think alike in one re-
spect, for Mr. Whiteside would
apply Mr. Wallace's A.A.A. to in-
dustry.
WHAT IT MEANS
The implications of the White-
side suggestion are perfectly
clear. A drastic reduction by
government edict would result
in vast unemployment. Since
government would be respon-
sible for this unemployment, it
would have to spend enormous
sums to relieve it. Moreover, in
those cases where companies
were put into red ink by gov-
ernmentally restricted produc-
tion, the government would
have to lend them money.
There is a minor note of
naivete in the suggestion that
price controls would have to be
devised to meet a diminishing
supply of goods. It is a fact the
only thing that has saved the
fumbling efforts of the admin-
istration to prevent inflation has
been an unexpected and un-
precedented increase in civilian
goods production and in savings.
Does Mr. Whiteside believe the
O.P.A. could be more effective
in peacetime without these aids
than it has been in war with
them?
