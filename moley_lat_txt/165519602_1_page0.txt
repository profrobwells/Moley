Deep in Heart
of Texas
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Texas folk believe in doing
something besides talk about the
political weather. The beating
suffered by the New Deal at the
Austin convention last week was
no unpremeditated act of blind
rage. It was a triumph for quiet,
lengthy and thorough organiza-
tion in the counties and pre-
cincts.
That is the lesson to be
learned by people in every State
who want a change. Texas re-
minds such people they can't talk
Mr. Roosevelt out of the White
House.
It has been no secret for years
that responsible citizens of Texas
were fed up with the New Deal.
Conversations with them when
they appeared in New York or
Washington were colorful and,
to be quite frank, irreverent,
when the administration was
mentioned,
'UNINSTRUCTED'
After months of ominous si-
lence, the precinct and county
conventions were held, and dele-
gates for the State convention
were chosen. The perfectly rea-
sonable suggestion was made by
many of the leaders in these
minor conventions that, since
Mr. Roosevelt had not made up
his mind, there was no reason
for them to make up theirs.
So delegates were, in the main,
uninstructed. The ominous word
"uninstructed" prevailed until
the State convention met and
then exploded with a mighty
roar.
An uninstructed delegation to
Chicago was selected and, what
was still more revolutionary, un-
instructed candidates for Presi-
dential electors were chosen.
That is, they were not instruct-
ed to vote for the candidate
chosen by the national conven-
tion in Chicago.
DEMANDS MADE
The delegates to Chicago were
handed a sight draft on the na-
tional Democracy for certain
matters that they felt were
due from a party they have sup-
ported for a century; first, that
the Democratic National Con-
vention condemn the Supreme
Court decision that Negroes can
vote in primaries in Texas; sec-
ond, that it deny the right of
Congress to define the qualifica-
tions of voters in the State;
third, that it disapprove efforts
to nullify State laws providing
for segregation in the schools.
If the national convention fails
to honor this demand, the dele-
gation to Chicago will vote as it
chooses. Then the electors on
the November ticket will be free
to vote for such candidates for
President and Vice-President as
they deem best qualified to carry
out what the Texas delegation
considers the ideals and tradi-
tions of the party.

If people feel little concern,
but sit back and trust Washing-
ton to do it all, it isn't surpris-
ing. They got used to it before
the war.
