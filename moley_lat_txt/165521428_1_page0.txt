How Dewey
Lines Up.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This appraisal is based on a
survey of opinion about the
current Presidential campaign
which has carried me across the
continent and which, at two
places, Portland and in San
Francisco, has made contact
with the Dewey Presidential
train. I have talked with political
observers and with veteran re-
porters on the Dewey train. I
add my own opinion, based on
comparisons with what other
candidates in other years have
done.
It is clear that Mr. Dewey
has done an extraordinary job
in his conferences with local
leaders of labor, agriculture and
business and in press confer-
ences. He has presented the
picture of a candidate who wants
to learn what he can of the
opinions, problems and condi-
tions of every element in the
life of the States through which
he has journeyed. He is atten-
tive, fair and acute in the end-
less process of question and
answer which such conferences
involve. His comments have
been informed, pointed and ef-
fective.
TALKS APPRAISED
In view of the unusual condi-
tions of this trip, in which people
are less concerned with politics
than with war, Mr. Dewey's re-
ceptions in the cities he has vis-
ited have been very favorable.
In San Francisco the crowds
which greeted him were as large
and as enthusiastic as those
which greeted Mr. Roosevelt in
1932. His audience in Portland
was big and responsive. There
has been nothing in the outward
expressions of public opinion to
justify any charges of apathy
either about politics in general
or about Mr. Dewey in par-
ticular. There is every evidence
that the outcome of this cam-
paign could be favorable to the
Republican candidate.
Mr. Dewey's speech in San
Francisco was the fifth major
effort of his current trip. I find
myself in agreement with the
wisest reporters on his train in
the opinion that he has made
two good speeches, two ineffec-
tive ones and one that was only
fair. The good ones were at
Louisville and Seattle; the un-
satisfactory ones at Philadel-
phia and Portland; the fair one
at San Francisco.
HOW IT LINES UP
Mr. Dewey has succeeded in
making his views on labor and
on foreign affairs clear and in
vivid contrast to the record of
his opponent. His views on
employment, economic freedom
and the administrative record
of the President have not yet
revealed any improvement on
the case made four years ago by
Mr. Willkie. Perhaps it is too
early to judge Dewey's views.
Speeches, however, will not
decide the election. It will be
decided by many factors which
cannot be appraised at this
time, among them being the de-
sire of the voters for a change,
their resentment against the
administration's failure to meas-
ure up to its promises and their
lack of confidence in a regime
that has been in power a long
time.
