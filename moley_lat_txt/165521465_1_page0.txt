Can Canute
Do the Job?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The plans of the C.I.O. to put
the President over the goal line
next November are in financial
amplitude and in controlled voting,
something without precedent in
American politics. Mark
Hanna never dreamed of such
a mobilization of power.
Attorney General Biddle, replying
to criticism by Rep
Smith, finds no cause for action
yet by his department against
the political action committee.
Apparently, the application of
the laws prohibiting political
contributions is to be avoided
by the use of the C.I.O. war
chest to "educate" members and
to see that they vote. The distinction
is hard to follow.
WHAT THEY WANT
Leaving aside the legal question,
what is the chief reason
for the anxiety of the C.I.O.?
Certainly, practical men like
Messrs. Hillman and Murray
are not becoming crusaders solely
to carry the Four Freedoms
to China, India and Poland. Nor
would Mr. Dubinsky forget for
the moment his factional squabble
with Mr. Hillman in order
to assure one and all of his devotion
to the fourth term without
a very practical motive.
The answer is the belief entertained
by these leaders that
only through a New Deal headed
by Mr. Roosevelt can national
economic law be reversed
by New Deal law. Years ago,
the President promised that
miracle by a simple bit of political
oratory: "Economic laws
are not made by nature. They
are made by human beings."
Hence, Messrs. Hillman, Murray
and Dubinsky want their human
beings—not the other fellow's
human beings—on the
law-production-line after the
war.
NATURE'S ARSENAL
Even if they were to have
their way, there would be a
battle royal between Mother
Nature and the old New Deal.
For, despite the President's assertion,
nature does make economic
laws and nature does not
grow old and ineffectual as human
beings do. Nature has a
well-stocked arsenal for the
postwar battle.
Clearly, Messrs. Hillman, Murray,
Dubinsky and other labor
leaders are going to lose a
whale of a lot of dues-paying
members. It is estimated that
organized labor had about
7,000,000 members in 1939. It
probably has 12,000,000 now. It
stands to lose 3,000,000 to
4,000,000 of these. It is reliably
estimated that after the war the
unions will have over a third
of industrial labor.
THE PROSPECT
Overtime, with its extra compensation,
will disappear. There
will be no more three-shift days.
A tremendous number of servicemen
will return and they
will certainly not be willing to
pay high initiation fees to get
back the jobs from which the
nation took them away.
This is the formidable onset
of a natural economic wave
against which the C.I.O. asks its
Canute to stand.
