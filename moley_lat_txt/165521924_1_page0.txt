The Disturbing
'Fourth Point'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Probably because he did not
wish to disturb his allies, Mr.
Churchill did not outline in his
radio speech the fourth point in
Britain's postwar program. But
mention of that point, which is
to increase British foreign trade,
appears in the influential British
weekly the Economist.
Much as Mr. Churchill protests
that he has always favored
semisocialistic reforms, the program
he outlines shows how far the war
has suppressed his conservative
instincts. But the question that
presents itself to Americans is how
far toward socialism Mr. Roosevelt
would go if he should receive the
fourth term that his followers so
confidently seek and expect. For
Mr. Roosevelt has no such conservative
tendencies as Mr. Churchill. His
history points in an entirely
different direction than does that
of the son of a conservative
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who
was himself a conservative
Chancellor.
CONTRADICTIONS?
Mr. Churchill's three points were:
Cradle-to-grave social security,
which has an appeal to the
inhabitants of a small island with
scanty national resources; a
strengthened agriculture, which
points to a British problem that
also has little analogy to our own
production problem; and a nation-wide
housing program.
The fourth plan outlined by The
Economist is an increase of British
exports of some 50 or 60 per cent
beyond the prewar volume. Rigid
import and export regulations will
be in order. An interempire tariff
preference would prevail which,
incidentally, would omit Canada and
British possessions near North
America.
At least two of these four points
seem to be in conflict with each
other. If England seeks to increase
her agriculture, how can she, at the
same time, increase her export of
manufactured goods? Before the
war, Canada, Denmark, Holland,
South America and Finland
supplied her with food and accepted
in return industrial products. Those
countries can hardly buy when they
cannot sell.
SPECIAL CONCERN
The three measures outlined by
Churchill are of no special concern
to the United States, since they
apply to social and economic
conditions peculiar to the British
Isles. Only those socialistically
inclined Americans whose arguments
are always buttressed by reference
to English policies' will find in them
any parallel for us.
The trade idea, however, will come
as a terrific shock to those who
expect this war to usher in a period
of trade freedom and to mark a
striking departure from the era of
trade restrictions which preceded
the war. This collision with American
advocates of free trade, The Economist
plan hopes to cushion by beseeching
our benevolent tolerance. It says that
the proposed program will put the
United States at a distinct disadvantage
with the new sterling bloc, which
will operate through exchange
control, preferential agreements,
trade quotas and other devices. But
our agreements to the program would
be sought on the basis of an agreement
by the British ultimately to co-operate
with us to restore reciprocal trade.
If we are "benevolent" enough, the
bloc will be expanded to include
France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark,
Portugal and their dependencies. Canada
is left out because that country is
regarded as within our legitimate
sphere of influence.
There were many who, in listening
to Mr. Churchill, felt that his
presentation of his proposed domestic
reforms lacked the majestic strength
which usually characterizes his war
speeches. Perhaps he was embarrassed
by the omission of the fourth point in
his discussion of the postwar program.
But if the Churchill government
adopts the program outlined by The
Economist, there will be keen disappointment
among those who have anticipated
fewer trade restrictions after this war.
