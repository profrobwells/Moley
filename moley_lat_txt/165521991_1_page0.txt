Fatalism Marks Dewey
Attitude Toward Race
Lesson of 1940 Convention Turned Governor
Into Philosopher, Raymond Moley Asserts
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
CHICAGO, June 25.—Within
three days this traveler has seen
two cities, Albany and Chicago.
They are thinking of the same
thing but their mood is as un-
like as the Equator and the Arc-
tic Circle. Chicago is hot with
excitement about everything in-
cluding what Albany is think-
ing. Albany is calm and busy
with State affairs. There is a
sort of Oriental fatalism in the
Albany attitude toward the hap-
penings in Chicago—what will hap-
pen will happen. But it may be
about what will happen.
I met Lt. Gov. Joe Hanley on
the street. He looked well and
happy. He indicated that he
loved the leisurely life of a Lieu-
tenant-Governor but, with a
spark in his eye, he said that he
wished the Governor well.
Reminders of Past
In the executive chamber were
those silent reminders of mo-
mentous days in the past—the
portraits of Governors who went
on to bigger things, Seward, Tilden,
Cleveland, Hughes, the two
Roosevelts.
The executive offices, mag-
nificently organized and arranged for
Gov. Dewey, were devoid of ex-
citement. Not more than half a
dozen visitors appeared during
the day. The Governor himself
was unhurried, communicative and
pleasant. There was time to talk
of many things, most of them un-
related to politics.
Four years ago at this time
Dewey was as close to the nomi-
nation as anyone could get and
lose it too. That disappointment
added cubits to his stature. It
turned a lawyer into a philoso-
pher. Never again would he seek
the Presidential nomination; if
it came it must come without
solicitation. And now that it
seems so likely to come it will
come unencumbered. Probably
no candidate in history can enjoy
such freedom of action when
chosen.
No Empty Rejoicing
That freedom of action will be
important, for no candidate ex-
cepting Lincoln ever faced such
responsibilities as a candidate and,
if elected, as President. And so
I suspect that if the nomi-
nation is made on Wednesday
there will be no empty rejoicing
in the executive chambers or
in the executive mansion. There
will be work to be done and
Gov. Dewey is no man to make
light of that.
With the memory of this quiet
Albany visit as a background,
the hustle of political Chicago
on the eve of the convention
comes as something of a shock.
Delegates are running around
asking why, if his nomination
is so sure, cannot Gov. Dewey
say something or do something
to break the suspense.
Much of this perturbation is
due to an inevitable urge on the
part of some delegates to “talk
things over” with the people
they are going to support. This
does not necessarily mean
“deals” but it provides a means
of gently suggesting that there
are priorities in politics. But
there will be no word from Al-
bany until the nomination is
made.
Tariff Policy
There has been plenty of ar-
gument in the resolutions com-
mittee over the foreign trade
plank. Gov. Landon, who favors
a generally lower tariff policy,
is chairman of the subcommittee
in charge. Also on the commit-
tee are two stalwart high tariff
people, Sen. Hawks of New Jersey
and former Sen. Grundy of
Pennsylvania. Whoever was re-
sponsible for the appointment
of Sen. Grundy must have been
strangely forgetful of the fact
that in half of Mr. Roosevelt’s
speeches of 1932 he made “Grundy-
ism” the very embodiment of
Old Guard Republican policy.
There is nothing new on
the Vice-Presidential nomination.
Most sentiment including that
of Gov. Warren. The Governor
does not want it and will be
difficult to persuade.
