A Needed
Discussion
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The suggestion from some
Washington quarters, that the
interest of Messrs. Dewey and
Dulles in what possums are be-
ing treed at Dumbarton Oaks is
bringing partisanship into for-
eign policy, is a little hard to
take seriously.
Obviously, Messrs. Roosevelt
and Hull have no one but them-
selves to blame for the fact that
the public has had a feeling of
uneasiness about the semisecret
American plan for world organ-
ization. Once more, as on many
occasions, they denied the press
information that was given to
several dozen foreigners, thus
indulging themselves in the in-
nocent belief that foreign diplo-
mats are not a very leaky lot.
Then one newspaper published
a detailed account of the Amer-
ican plan. The press generally,
and with very good reason, was
deeply offended at this.
VITAL SUGGESTIONS
That clumsy and ineffective
attempt at secrecy has enabled
Mr. Dewey to take the ball away
from the Messrs. Roosevelt and
Hull. As the muffled confer-
ence proceeds, Mr. Dewey and
his representative, Mr. Dulles,
are making the headlines with
interesting, constructive and vi-
tally important suggestions
about foreign policy. They have
thrown the internationalization
of the Ruhr into public discus-
sion. We may be sure that oth-
er items of that sort will follow.
Mr. Dewey quite properly and
shrewdly realizes that the
American people, whose blood
and property have been given
to this war, want some part in
the consideration of preventing
future wars. If the President
chooses to treat the people like
children and peace negotiations
as if they were his private
secrets, the public is going to
listen to Mr. Dewey—who, at
any rate, is willing to talk and
who sounds as if he knew what
he was talking about.
HIS RIGHT
Mr. Dewey is also demon-
strating his right, as a candi-
date, to have a reasonable dis-
cussion of international affairs
in the forthcoming campaign.
Democrats seem to be trying to
say that it is legitimate to
charge that Mr. Dewey knows
nothing about foreign affairs
and, at the same time, to tell
him that he cannot talk about it.
Mr. Dewey upsets this fine kettle
of fish by making it clear that
the public is entitled to hear a
dispassionate discussion of for-
eign policy and, at the same
time, an exceedingly sharp dis-
cussion of foreign relations.
This distinction between for-
eign policy and foreign rela-
tions is well made. Foreign
policy is an expression of the
general objectives of the nation
in the foreign field. Foreign re-
lations are the methods, tactics
and measures employed in fur-
thering foreign policy.
This distinction, properly
made, can provide this campaign
with plenty of action—action
which might well be altogether
useful to the public.
