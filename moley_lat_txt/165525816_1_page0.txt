New Citizens
as Voters
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the many factors
which will have a bearing upon
the nebulous forecasts of the
Presidential election this year
is the naturalization of aliens.
The election may well be decided
in the big industrial cities
of the Northeast and Middle
West. Certainly, the chance for
a fourth term will depend, as
the third-term campaign depended,
upon the extent to which
big majorities for Mr. Roosevelt
in the big cities can overcome
the ebbing New Deal tide in
the small towns and in the country.
While immigration has very
greatly declined during these
war years; of course, the volume
of naturalization now, as always,
reflects conditions of several
years before. The filing of declarations
of intention (“first
papers”) being a relatively simple
matter, it generally responds
to some influence upon the alien.
Usually he neglects this act of
declaring his allegiance until
something happens which affects
his employment, eligibility for
some benefit or like.
GREAT PICKUP
The threat of war in the home
country is extremely important.
Hence, in 1938, the number of
declarations of intention filed
jumped to a very high mark.
It then fell off for two years
or so, but with our entry into
the war it rose again. Since
then it has gone to a very low
mark, largely because nearly
every alien who has the intelligence
or eligibility or inclination
has now filed “first papers”
and because few new aliens have
entered the country.
While an alien, if he has the
residence requirements, is technically
eligible to full citizenship
two years after “first papers,”
the actual time of admission to
citizenship is usually more than
four years after. So there has
been a big accumulation of candidates
in the last two years.
Getting these people through is
a job for the courts, the Bureau
of Naturalization of the Department
of Justice, the county authorities
and the many private
welfare agencies that help.
There has been a terrific pickup
in the government’s activity
in the past year or so. Last year
318,033 aliens were naturalized.
This is the largest number since
1907 when admission was much
easier than now. Of this group,
the largest number had been
British subjects, always slow to
acquire citizenship here after
entering the country. Nearly 30
per cent were British. The Polish
came next with 13 per cent,
11 per cent were Italian, 5 per
cent were German.
MAY BE IMPORTANT
The government since December
has been still more energetic
in accelerating naturalization. In
Cleveland, which is typical of
the cities with a large foreign-
born population, 10 new naturalization
examiners were sent in
by the Bureau of Naturalization,
and each week heavy court hearings
are held
with an output of 300 or 400
new citizens a week.
The net effect of this in its
influence upon the election
should measurably help Mr.
Roosevelt. It is probable that
most of the former British subjects
and the refugees will vote
for him. The position of the new
citizens of Polish origin and of
other non-Russian Slavs is problematical.
It may easily depend
upon the attitude of these
groups toward the administration
after its attitude on Russian
claims is made clear. It is
unfortunate, needless to say,
that foreign-born voting should
hinge upon European happenings,
but it has always been so
and, in election calculations, it
is always a factor.
The overall number of new
citizens will not be large enough
to stand against a big drift of
opinion. But in a close election
it may be exceedingly important.
