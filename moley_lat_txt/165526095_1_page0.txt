The Styles
Candidacy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 27.
There are a good many red
faces in Hollywood that the sun
didn't make so. They belong to
those boys and girls of the re-
gion who, in May, joined with
Sidney Hillman's Political Ac-
tion Committee in purging the
able and respected Congressman
John M. Costello.
The temporary beneficiary of
the Costello purge and the 15th
District's Democratic candidate
is Hal Styles, a radio commen-
tator. He was charged, on the
day that Dewey entered Cali-
fornia, with a membership some
years ago in the Ku Klux Klan
in Queens County, New York.
Mr. Styles has admitted since
that he was once a member of
"an intolerant organization."
The Democratic leaders are
making an investigation.
JUST A MARTYR?
As is usual in such situations,
Mr. Styles claims that he is a
martyr in the great crusade be-
cause reactionaries are seeking
to injure the President through
attacks on himself. He joined
the "intolerant organization" be-
cause he wanted to learn more
about it, he says. And subse-
quently he wrote an attack on
it.
Whatever happens to the
Styles candidacy, enough has
been developed to justify a
number of conclusions about
the P.A.C. purge movement. In
the first place, a competent and
sincere political organization in-
vestigates its candidates before,
and not after, it decides to back
them. In the second place, the
incident shows how little the
P.A.C. cares for personal ca-
pacity, as long as its candidates
pledge undeviating support of
the President in Congress.
What, it may be asked, would
a Congress made up entirely of
men like Mr. Styles be? Third,
the embarrassment of the Hol-
lywood figures who helped in
the purge is solely due to their
foolish and dangerous belief
that an ideological test is all
that is necessary in supporting
a candidate. All that they need
is to see his name affixed to the
articles of New Deal faith to
waive all questions of experi-
ence and former public serv-
ices.
ONE-MAN RULE?
In this case, Mr. Costello was
a Democrat and a man of gen-
uine talents. But his occasional
demonstrations of independence
marked him for slaughter. And
this indifference to the experi-
ence and proved ability of Mr.
Costello comes from the same
people who are shouting that
we must keep Mr. Roosevelt
in office because of his experl-
ence.
Once again the danger to rep-
resentative government in such
a movement as the P.A.C. is
brought out. The net of their
efforts, if they should succeed
in all districts as they succeeded
in this one, would be a Con-
gress not necessarily devoted to
the interests of labor, but
rather to the President person-
ally. The result of such a test
would be one-man government.
