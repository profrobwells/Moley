The Veterans
Look Ahead
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
DENVER, Sept. 20. For sev-
eral days the streets and hotel
lobbies in Denver have present-
ed a scene which stimulates the
imagination of anyone interest-
ed in the human problems of
this country. Eight hundred or
900 representatives of the 50,000
members of the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans are here holding
their annual convention. Min-
gled with them is the normal
stream of young soldiers of the
present war, who are passing
through on leave or moving
from one camp to another.
What, the observer of this
contrast wonders, are the young-
sters thinking about these vet-
erans who were disabled in bat-
tles fought before the present
army was born? And what are
the veterans thinking as they
see young men who were sum-
moned to do a job for which
the men of 1918 gave their blood
a quarter-century ago?
SEEKING THE ANSWERS
I set myself to find some an-
swers to these questions by
talking with members of both
generations.
The young men were, of
course, less communicative.
They have had little time to
think since Uncle Sam called
them. One of them said: "We
wonder how many of us will
be in this organization 25 years
from now." Another said, "We
want to get it over and go
home." Another, "Jobs? We'll
worry about that when we get
home. Peace league? Only strong
nations can keep the peace."
The veterans talked plenty.
They have done a lot of think-
ing. One man in a wheel chair
said, "You get a lot of time to
think in 25 years in one of
these."
The D.A.V. is already welcom-
ing into its ranks the disabled
men of this war. They feel they
have done a good job of organ-
izationâ€”something that won't
have to be done again. After a
couple of years the young fel-
lows can take over. One of the
things they have done best has
been to create a big service or-
ganization to help disabled vet-
erans with the many problems
and complications involved in
contacts with the government.
SIMILAR REPLIES
The answers of the veterans
to questions about international
security after the war were
strikingly similar. To prevent
future wars, they say, the Unit-
ed States will have to be a lot
stronger than it was before this
war. They say that their organ-
ization, like the American Le-
gion, tried to promote prepared-
ness for years, with little suc-
cess. This time they hope they
will be listened to. They believe
that if we had been stronger
Hitler would never have started
this war. They are not interest-
ed in postwar plans about jobs.
They want to get this war over,
to be good and strong at the
finish and then to talk about
what to do.
They believe in policing the
defeated countries, but having
seen two wars come, they say
they are not sure that wars can
be permanently prevented. They
insist, however, that a war can
be ended more quickly if the
United States is prepared. In-
variably they come back to that
point.
POWERFUL FACTOR
This appears to be a power-
ful factor in the thinking of
men who have been in the thick
of battle. Their faith was in
strength, in more and bigger
guns and battalions. When the
strength seemed to be lacking
they thought of the years that
had passed before the war with
only indifferent attention to
preparation. They blamed the
people who were in a position
to make that preparation. They
blame them now.
All this may not fit either the
rational or the surrealistic
thinking of those who believe
that there are better roads to
security than armament. It may
not suit the people who believe
that soldiers are profoundly con-
cerned with elaborate govern-
ment plans for postwar domes-
tic and international security.
But this is what these men were
saying, as the two generations
mingled in Denver during this
convention.
