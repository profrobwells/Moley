The Dewey-Dulles Peace Plan
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gov. Dewey has hit several
birds with the stone he tossed
at the President's foreign policy
plans, and his action deserves
a high rating in tactics.
His warning has, in the first
place, compelled President
Roosevelt to take note of him
and to keep him informed of
matters in preliminary peace
arrangements. Up to the time
Dewey raised his voice, President
Roosevelt and Secretary
Hull were proceeding much as
President Wilson did in 1918
and 1919. They were treating
the highly significant Dumbarton
Oaks discussions as a private
concern, ignoring the fact
that an election is coming along
at which Mr. Dewey may be
selected to take over all their
labors. Mr. Dewey has effectively
put them on notice in that
regard.
WHAT IT MEANS
Second, Mr. Dewey has placed
himself before the country as a
person who not only is aware
of the significance of postwar
plans but as one who is thoroughly
familiar with current developments.
This will go a long
way toward answering the partisan
argument, already adopted
as the trump card of the Democrats,
that only Mr. Roosevelt
can be trusted to represent us
at the peace table because only
Mr. Roosevelt knows what has
been cooking in our diplomacy.
If Democrats raise that argument
now, the Republican answer
can be that Mr. Hull promised
to tell Mr. Dewey everything
he knew and that Mr.
Dewey must therefore know
everything that Mr. Roosevelt
knows—unless Mr. Roosevelt
knows something that Mr. Hull
doesn't know, which Democrats
might not want to admit.
The incident, moreover, has
given Mr. Dewey the opportunity
to show his extraordinary
equipment to deal with foreign
policy. Quite properly, he chose
John Foster Dulles to represent
him in conference with Mr. Hull.
Mr. Dulles bears the same relation
to Mr. Dewey that Mr.
Hull bears to Mr. Roosevelt. He
is the unofficial Secretary of
State and, if Mr. Dewey is elected,
he will probably be his official
Secretary of State.
A REAL DIPLOMAT
The competence of Mr. Dulles
in foreign affairs is of the first
order. No American Secretary
of State since John Hay has
such a long and distinguished
record as an international lawyer
as has Mr. Dulles. He grew
up in the household of a great
diplomat and former Secretary
of State, John W. Foster. Grandpa
Foster was Secretary of
State James G. Blaine’s right-
hand man in the initiation of
the good-neighbor policy in the
early ‘90s, and as such, Foster
conducted the negotiations with
several countries for pioneer
reciprocal trade agreements.
When Mr. Foster later became
Secretary of State, he came very
close to annexing Hawaii and
would have succeeded except
for the Democratic administration
which came into power under
Cleveland. Dulles’ brilliant
career in international law
shows how well he learned his
grandfather’s lessons. He is a
bred-in-the-bone diplomat.
The Dewey-Dulles program,
which this incident gives Mr.
Dewey the opportunity to present,
calls for two sorts of peacekeeping
machinery after the
war. The first would be two
councils of the four big powers
to police Germany and Japan.
The second would be a league
of 60-odd large and small nations
for permanent purposes.
Both would be created immediately
after the war, but they
would operate independently.
This plan ought to satisfy
everyone, even Mr. Willkie, of
Mr. Dewey’s genuine intention
to give practical shape to the
promise of the Republican party.
