The Texas
Revolt
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is a very notable precedent to show how powerful a
weapon the Democrats of Texas
and Mississippi have forged in
their opposition to Washington
domination. That precedent is
what happened in South Dakota
in 1912. Curiously, so far, none
of the comments on the Texas
revolt have mentioned it.
In May of that year, Theodore
Roosevelt, La Follette and Taft
ran in the Presidential primary.
T.R. won. In June the delegates
selected in the South Dakota primary
and pledged to T.R. bolted
the Republican convention.
They participated later in the
Bull Moosa convention which
nominated Roosevelt. Before the
election that year in South Dakota,
the electors who appeared
on the Republican ticket publicly
announced that they would, if
elected, refuse to vote for Taft
and would cast the electoral vote
of the State for Roosevelt. They
were elected and they carried
out their plan. Thus, the duly
elected Republican electors of
the State refused to be bound by
the nomination of their party.
NO VOTES FOR TAFT
It should be noted that the
names of the candidates for
President were not on the South
Dakota ballot in November.
Only the electors' names appeared.
In these circumstances,
no Republican in the State could
vote for Taft, and in the various
compilations of the popular vote
for that year, the State of South
Dakota shows no votes for Taft.
The bolting electors justified
their action on the grounds of
their legal right to vote as they
pleased, although that legal right
was not seriously questioned.
They also claimed a moral justification because the State, in the
primary, had selected the Republican candidate and because
the action of the Republican convention, in nominating Taft, was
not binding on the State.
STATE SOVEREIGNTY
That being true, they insisted
on the right to vote for Roosevelt,
even though he was nominated
by another political party.
Thus South Dakota established a
principle of State sovereignty in
party matters.
The difference between this
precedent and the situation in
Texas and Mississippi is that the
Republican voters in South Dakota
clearly indicated a preference
for T.R. in the primary and
the Texas and Mississippi voters
have expressed no choice.
But in claiming the right to
reject the party candidate, the
southern electors can claim
mandates from their State conventions, which are, in their
States, the official agents of Democratic voters.
