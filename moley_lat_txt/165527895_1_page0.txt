G.O.P.'s
Chance
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The appearance of Perry How-
ard in Chicago, ready to con-
test the representation of the
State of Missouri in the Repub-
lican convention, has become a
symbol of the eternal life of the
Republican party.
Real old-timers may go back
more than 20 years, but it was
that long ago that I first heard
Perry argue his case against the
"lily-white" contestants from his
State. And Perry, it may be
added, argues his case well. He
has dignity and uses a choice
assortment of good wordsâ€”
much better, as I remember it,
than those his "lily-white" oppo-
nents used. And so the Repub-
lican show begins in traditional
style.
WE SHALL SEE
Traditions hang heavily about
a national convention. Perhaps
that is because politicians are
a superstitious lot. They don't
like innovations. They even
cling closely to the formulas
which have lost them so many
battles in the past. There will
be plenty of things in this con-
vention to suggest that this as-
pect of life in politics, at least,
goes on and on.
But these are not ordinary
times. Traditional campaign
methods are not going to attract
public favor this year. Perhaps
the candidate, when elected,
will provide changes in methods
and policies which will be in
keeping with the times and with
the spirit of the people. We
shall see.
SHORT AND SERIOUS?
The convention itself will
likely run true to tradition.
There is now going on that much
ado about nothing which char-
acterizes platform writing. No
platform ever won or lost an
election. Platforms aren't re-
membered well enough. If any
part of a platform offends any-
one after the convention, more-
over, the candidate can and does
pluck it out and cast it away.
The platform builders might
very well permit Mr. Willkie to
help.
The other matter on which a
good deal of energy is about to
be wasted is the selection of a
Vice-Presidential candidate. The
people are not fooled by a Vice-
Presidential candidate, although
politicians still think they are.
The people know that the Vice-
President is spinach, that he
has no power and that no ambi-
tious, active man wants to spend
his years going to silly dinners in
Washington.
The Republican Presidential
candidate, whoever he may be,
will make or break the cam-
paign. Either of the leading can-
didates, Dewey or Bricker, if
nominated, would, I am certain,
see the necessity of conducting
his campaign in keeping with
the extraordinary times in
which we are living.
As the convention rumbles
into action, let us hope that it
will be short, serious and de-
cisive. The public has other
things to worry about these
days.
