Some Plans
for Balkans
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
About all we have known of
Tito, the Yugoslav, is that he is
a good fighter. But now we
know something else. He has
selected as Foreign Minister a
real statesman whose ideas con-
cerning the Balkans make more
sense than anything we have
heard from the great Allied pow-
ers. In an interview obtained
by the New York Times, Dr.
Josip Smodlaka, Tito's 74-year-
old Minister of Foreign Affairs,
who is now in Italy, outlines the
postwar purposes of his govern-
ment.
His proposal for a Balkan set-
tlement is a federation. This
comes quite naturally to a Yugo-
slav, for that country main-
tained a federation within itself
with fair success between the
wars. He proposes a federation
to include Bulgaria, Greece and
Yugoslavia. Macedonia, the
eternal bone of contention be-
tween his country and Bulgaria,
he would give full autonomy
within a federal Balkan state.
'SLAVIC' MOTIF
Throughout Smodlaka's
lengthy statement the word
"Slav" occurs, which suggests
his purpose of basing his set-
tlement upon the kinship of
small Slavic states. He sees the
states in the federation as based
upon free governments, with
equal rights for all religions and
nationalities. He denied Com-
munism would prevail in the
proposed federation.
To all who are not determined
in the face of all facts to dis-
trust Russia, this should be re-
assuring. Unquestionably, what-
ever Smodlaka or Tito says is
not displeasing to Stalin. This
proposal is not Pan-Slavism in
the old sense of the word, be-
cause that policy involved Rus-
sian imperial domination. But
that Russia wants the small
Slavic states in the Balkans to
see that their common interests
are protected is natural.
The most significant part of
this Yugoslav plan is that it
means that earlier Russian inti-
mations that no federations were
to be permitted do not mean
all they seemed to mean. They
meant a federation of sympa-
thetic states is to be approved.
SIGNIFICANT NOW
This plan has special signif-
icance now that the Russian
armies are moving swiftly into
the Balkans. They may, before
long, be joined with Tito's forces
and, when that happens, a pow-
erful partition will be created,
cutting off Germans in Bulgaria
and Greece. That may result
in another and bigger Crimean
pocket.
While this is going on, there
is strong evidence of the forma-
tion of a Scandinavian federa-
tion under the leadership of
Sweden.
The Swedish government is
already working with the exiled
governments of Norway and
Denmark. Loans and other as-
sistance may follow. This is not
only evidence that Russia is
agreeable to such a federation
of genuinely non-Communist
states, but that Sweden, which
knows most of Germany's in-
ternal conditions, is moving on
the assurance that the Nazis
have lost their power to injure
her.
