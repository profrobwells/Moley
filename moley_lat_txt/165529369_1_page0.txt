Willkie's
Arguments
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Mr. Wendell Willkie has a
trick of arguing which is fa-
miliar to juries in every hamlet
in the land. It can best be
shown by a simple series of let-
ters. The lawyer with this
Willkie trick thunders to the
jury, "The witness for the other
side says X." Then, a few min-
utes later, he adds something to
what the witness says, and
shouts, "I cannot believe that
XY is true." Then later, he adds
qualification Z to XY and asks
the jury if it believes XYZ.
Finally he says solemnly, "I
cannot believe that this jury will
accept the proposition YZ."
Since no one can deny X, this
trick enables the lawyer to fill
the jury's mind with a proposi-
tion which he, not the opposi-
tion, has created.
AS TO "SOVEREIGNTYâ€”"
Let us see how Mr. Willkie
does this in a current article in
Collier's in which he denounces
both parties, their candidates
and platforms. He is talking
about "sovereignty," a word used
by both parties in describing our
participation in an international
organization. Mr. Willkie quotes
Mr. Dewey's "America will par-
ticipate with other sovereign na-
tions" and so forth. He next
quotes Mr. Roosevelt's words "to
use the armed forces of the sov-
ereign nations." These state-
ments Mr. Willkie then inter-
prets as follows: "We are jeal-
ously to guard our sovereignty."
Later he restates what they
have said in a still more extreme
form. "When every party to a
prepared agreement stands pat
and refuses to yield any individ-
ual right or privilege," he ob-
serves, "there is no agreement."
He drops the word "sovereignty"
and begins pummeling his own
words. Whereupon, Mr. Willkie
delivers a long sermon, not
against sovereignty or Dewey or
Roosevelt but against "jealous-
ly," "standpatism" and "selfish-
ness."
AN EXAMPLE
The argument about sov-
ereignty can be cleared up by a
simple definition of the word
which Mr. Willkie either does
not know or which he pretends
not to know. The most eminent
authority on political theory in
America, Prof. F. W. Coker of
Yale, gives this one: "In inter-
national law, sovereignty is gen-
erally held to be an essential
qualification for full membership
in the family of nations." So,
sovereignty is the very quality
that enables a nation to partici-
pate in a peace organization. If
the nation were not sovereign, it
would have no power to join a
league or association. It could
not make a contract of itself.
When we say that a man
should remain free, we do not
mean that he cannot marry. The
right to make contractual obliga-
tions is the essence of freedom.
And the right of sovereignty is
the very quality which enables
a nation to do what Mr. Willkie
wants if, in his torrents of
words, Mr. Willkie has very spe-
cifically said what he wants.
