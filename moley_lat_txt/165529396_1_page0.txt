Cost of Living
and Unions
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a recent column I suggested
that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. attack
upon the Department of Labor's
cost-of-living index may be the
preliminary to a drive for higher
wages all around. But it is possible
the time for such an effort
to succeed has already gone. If
so, John L. Lewis will be re-
membered once more as a tac-
tician shrewder than his not-too-
friendly compeers in the A.F.L.
and C.I.O.
Even a clean knockout of
the Department of Labor fig-
ures will help very little in raising
wages if, as seems likely,
the peak of employment will
soon have been passed. The total
employment figure last year,
when Lewis made his bold move,
may not be reached again in our
time.
THE PROSPECT
The Office of Price Administra-
tion has already figured that in
1944 most overtime pay will begin
to vanish and that, even at
that, pay rolls will cut back na-
tional income by about 15 per
cent.
All this is obvious to the unions.
Hence their urgent desire
to get the wage level as high
as possible before the inevitable
leveling down takes place. But
the question is whether the national
interest is served by any
such rise in union wages at a
moment when the great majority
of workers outside the
unions are bound to feel, and
some are already feeling, the
pinch of lessening employment.
The argument of the A.F.L.-
C.I.O. people about shortages
and the deterioration of quality
of the goods they buy is already
losing its effectiveness. It seems
only yesterday when we tried
to make one cup of coffee do
the work of two. Now we read
advertisements urging restaurants
to give an extra cup as
part of the "good neighbor policy."
FACTS CHANGING
The shortage of wool is converted
into plenty. Since some
metals are again available, certain
wartime furniture is said
to be unsalable. Department
stores are figuring that the moment
Nylons reappear a very
heavy depreciation in stocks of
war material will be in order.
Thus, in the time it takes labor
statisticians to prepare their
case, the facts behind their statistics
have changed.
All of which may explain why
we hear less and less about the
miracles to be achieved by roll-
back subsidies. There are forces
at work on the business of roll-
backs more potent than any government.
A number of farsighted industrialists
recently pointed out
that neither employers nor the
nation as a whole can be benefited
by a drastic fall in wages
during or after the war. A wise
policy for union labor would be
to emphasize the danger of a
general decline in the national
income, realizing that to sky-
rocket the wages of a minority
of favored workers is no way to
prevent such a decline. In a period
of slow recession of employment,
such as we are entering,
such a drive might well
accelerate a decline.
