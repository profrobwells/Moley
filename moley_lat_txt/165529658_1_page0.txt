Republican
Unity Shown
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A comparison of the views of
Messrs. Bricker, Dewey and
Willkie shows how utterly fool-
ish it is to talk of a Republican
split on foreign policy. Each
of these three Republican lead-
ers has now set forth his ideas
in a carefully prepared speech.
Mr. Willkie spoke in Omaha on
April 6; Mr. Bricker and Mr.
Dewey in New York on April
25 and 27, respectively.
Except for the fact that each
speech, in form, takes on some
of the personality of the man
who delivered it, there is little
difference in the content of
these addresses, Mr. Willkie's
was longer and more discursive.
Mr. Bricker's had a more order-
ly legal and philosophical con-
sistency. Mr. Dewey's was more
closely clipped and general.
DIFFERENT FIELDS
Each selected a different field
for specification. Mr. Willkie
gave more detail about his ob-
jections to American foreign
policy since Pearl Harbor. Mr.
Bricker gave more detail on the
administration's mistakes before
Pearl Harbor. Mr. Dewey, pos-
sibly because his audience was
composed of newspaper proprie-
tors and editors, dwelt longer
on constitutional issues.
All three recognized that per-
manent peace machinery is nec-
essary. All three declared the
United States, Great Britain,
Russia and China should form
the nucleus of such an organiza-
tion. None of the three favors
an international police setup.
None wants to go back to the
League of Nations. All three
call for more publicity on for-
eign affairs.
GENUINE BASIS
Messrs. Dewey and Bricker
speak kindly of Mr. Hull, but
they assert that the President
is too prone to by-pass the State
Department. Mr. Willkie says
Mr. Hull is too general in his
views.
Messrs. Dewey and Bricker
praise the Republican party for
its Mackinac declaration. Mr.
Willkie is silent on the subject.
Messrs. Dewey and Bricker
call for the complete defeat of
Germany and Japan.
Mr. Dewey points out the mis-
takes of the 1919 peace. Dewey
and Bricker call for care in our
economic commitments to the
rest of the world.
Messrs. Dewey and Willkie
both make a strong point in sug-
gesting the danger of entrust-
ing the handling of postwar
problems to an old and tired ad-
ministration. This point will be
made over and over in the cam-
paign. It can be made very ef-
fectively if Mr. Roosevelt de-
cides to run.
Altogether, these three
speeches provide a genuine basis
for the argument that the Re-
publican party can be trusted
to conclude the war and make
the peace.
