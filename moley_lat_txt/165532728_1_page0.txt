The Ancient
Regime
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The death of Hampton P. Ful-
mer, chairman of the House
Committee on Agriculture, is a
genuine loss to the House and
to the Democratic party. He was
an able and useful man. He
lived and served well into his
70th year. Only 17 present mem-
bers of the House had served
longer than he.
The passing of Mr. Fulmer
brings once more to our atten-
tion a fact about the present re-
gime in Washington which de-
serves the realistic and serious
consideration of those who are
voting in this election. This fact
can be considered without rais-
ing the slightest question about
the President's health or age—
points which I am not consid-
ering in this place.
A WHOLE REGIME
What I do say is that we are
not voting for the President
alone this year, but for a whole
regime, including the Cabinet,
the major political appointees
in the administration and the
controlling and influential Dem-
ocratic officers in both Houses
of Congress. With the re-elec-
tion of Mr. Roosevelt we are
continuing that whole regime
in positions of power. That will
be true even if the House goes
Republican, as may well be true.
In a political regime considera-
tions of long service, political
influence and seniority prevail.
No President can change that,
and of all Presidents this one
has shown the least disposition
to clean house. Even if he were
so disposed, he could not change
the seniority rules of Congress.
Among the 10 chairmen of the
10 most important committees
of the House, Mr. Fulmer, even
at his ripe age, was one of the
younger men. Seven of the 10
are older. The average age of
the nine survivors on Jan. 20,
1945, will be 72 years and ap-
proximately 9 months.
In the Senate the average age
of the 10 chairmen of the 10
most important committees will
be 70 years and about 6 months.
The ripe age of the Cabinet
has been mentioned so often
that it needs no repetition.
JUST CONSIDER
But this does not complete the
story of an aging regime. Con-
sider all the minor officers
throughout the administration
who are also growing old. Con-
sider, also, the wear and tear
of 12 years of official service in
the turmoil and heat of Wash-
ington. Consider the mental fag
and intellectual sterility that
grows with such arduous years.
Thus, we have the picture of
tired and worn superiors sup-
ported by tired and worn sub-
ordinates.
It is poor sportsmanship for
the New Deal to object to a men-
tion of age. Mr. Roosevelt and
his minute-men had no such
scruples when, in 1937, they
were attacking the nine old men
in the Supreme Court.

The man reported to receive
$45,000 a year says it is paid
right out to others as soon as
it comes in. That’s just the trou-
ble with nearly everybody’s in-
come.
