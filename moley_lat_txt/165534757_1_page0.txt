Synthetic
Recovery
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gov. Dewey's allusion in Pitts-
burgh to "the Roosevelt depres-
sion of 1933 to 1940" brings up
a subject which will provoke a
lot of arguments in this cam-
paign. New Deal supporters
will say hotly that 1933 to 1937
marked a period of unprecedent-
ed recovery, all due to Mr.
Roosevelt's policies, although
they will admit a so-called "re-
cession" in 1937-38.
Administration orators said
at that time that the drop in
1937 was due to a "strike" of
capital or capitalists. To sug-
gest that was a silly charge, of
course.
DEWEY WAS RIGHT
Gov. Dewey was clearly cor-
rect in his general charge, for
we had no genuine recovery in
that whole period of seven
years, and nothing so plainly
showed that we had not solved
our problems as the "recession"
of 1937.
The 1937 break was sharp and
unexpected. We now know that
it began suddenly, the day after
Labor Day. Apparently, when
the manufacturers of durable
goods looked over their order
books after they had returned
from their holiday they gave
out orders to sell and to cancel
orders for materials. The steel
mills were laying off men be-
fore September was over.
By December, a consensus of
reliable economists as to the
causes of the decline ran some-
thing like this:
We had experienced four
years of an inflationary trend,
because of government spend-
ing, including bonus payments
to veterans. There had been
sharp rises in material and la-
bor costs. Money was cheap,
but hard to get for long-time
capital uses. The undistributed-
profits tax had forced companies
to pay out their earnings, which
not only weakened their posi-
tion but added to the inflation-
ary trend.
The Federal Reserve Board,
alarmed, raised reserve require-
ments. Business and agricul-
ture needed credit, and banks,
to meet the demand, sold gov-
ernment bonds. That weak-
ened the bond market.
The C.I.O. drive and sit-down
strikes disturbed industrial con-
ditions and accelerated the rise
in wages. Companies began
losing money, took fright and
stopped buying.
NOT A RECOVERY
All this suggests how syn-
thetic was the prosperity upon
which Mr. Roosevelt won his
election in 1936. It was not a
recovery, but a phony substi-
tute for recovery. The remedies
applied were equally synthetic.
Margin requirements were cut,
and, in April, 1938, the Treas-
ury "desterilized" a large
amount of gold. Mr. Roosevelt
rushed to the front with vast
plans for new spending and the
administration, through Sen.
O'Mahoney's temporary nation-
al economic committee, began
trouncing business.
Gov. Dewey is perfectly right
in saying that it took the war
to save the administration.
