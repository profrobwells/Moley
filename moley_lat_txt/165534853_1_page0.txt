Keep an Eye
on Balkans!
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A good deal of the talk we
hear about policing Europe
after the war seems to assume
that the whole problem is Ger-
many. The need to keep an eye
on the small nations of Eu-
rope, especially the Balkans, is
just as acute.
Long before Hitler's rise,
when Germany was under non-
armament restrictions, German
influence was preparing to make
the tools of war in adjacent
countries. In some instances the
matter went beyond prepara-
tions. In 1920 the manufacture
of the more efficient airplane
motors was prohibited in Ger-
many by the Versailles treaty.
A high official of the German
government of that time con-
fided to a German businessman
that moto:3 were being made
for the general staff in Czecho-
slovakia, in plants which were
partly German owned,
EASIER PLACE?
It is altogether clear that
without access to the essential
materials of her neighbors, Ger-
many could not have risked war
at all. Her need for Romanian
oil, Swedish ore and the Czech
industrial plants are all illus-
trations of this dependence.
Fascist Italy was the source of
the ideological infection which
helped produce Nazism in Ger-
many. War and preparations for
war in Europe cannot be local-
ized. The infection crosses all
boundaries.
Some of the small war-breed-
ing nations, such as Romania
and Bulgaria, are now rushing
to cover. They hope to use the
necessity of the Allies to beat
Germany quickly as a means
of getting an easier peace. Ro-
mania deserves no more sym-
pathy than Germany and no less
policing. It gave Hitler indis-
pensable oil, instituted shock-
ing persecutions and its armies
inflicted shocking cruelties in
Russia. The plea of Bulgaria is
almost comic. After helping Hit-
ler slaughter tens of thousands
of our real allies in Greece and
Yugoslavia, the Bulgarians now
try to bargain with the Allies
to retain some of their stolen
territory. There is hardly a
small nation in Europe that
should not be rigidly policed for
many years, and the time to
start the job is now.
DIRE POSSIBILITY
The fact that the next war
could be started by a small
country with terrific force and
by some wholly surprise ele-
ment, intensifies the problem of
the peacemakers. The robot has
suggested hundreds of possibill-
ities to bloodthirsty minds.
The decisive weapon in an-
other war might be made in a
back room or a woodshed. Mili-
tary men now know that tra-
ditional military defenses are
gone forever. The great danger
is that the peace this time will
be made, as it was before, by
men whose concepts are shaped
by what happened in this war.
But as soon as the last gun is
fired the techniques of this war
will be dead. The threats to fu-
ture peace will be everywhere
and preventive measures should
be much broader and more in-
tensive than any responsible
statesman has yet suggested,
