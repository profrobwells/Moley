The disintegration of Germany
shows, among other things, that
a political party and an army
cannot be permanently integrated.
Over the unholy grave of
the Fuehrer it should be written
that he failed to identify Nazism
with Germany. The party, the
army and the nation made common
cause for a while out of
great humiliation and a great
hatred. But what we see now is
that love of country, not hatred
of its neighbors or bombastic
ideology, is the only thing that
can make a whole people fight to
the death.

The coming debacle has been
foreshadowed over several
months. The first real intimation
of the nature of the trouble
became apparent that a surprising
number of generals were
slipping into the Russian bag of
prisoners. Since then a captured
general a day has been
driving Hitler away. As the
grim humor of the Russian
puts it, "We have a general assembly
in Russia."

No doubt, the generals have
taken note of the Russian determination,
expressed a year or
more ago, that it is no part of
Russian policy completely to disarm
the Reich. Candidates for
the postwar skeleton army may
well be found among captured
generals in Russia. In a real
sense they would be on the priority
list in a new German army,
acceptable to Russia. At any
rate, they would be aliveâ€”an assurance
not accorded to those
high officers who are caught in
the civil war now opening in
Germany.

The elimination of top generals,
in part by capture on the
Russian front, in part by Nazi
liquidation, can hardly fail to
precipitate demoralization in
the rank and file of the German
army. Every general is, in the
eyes of a German soldier, a half-
god. Not since Hindenburg and
Moltke have names been so elevated
as those of von Brauchitsch
and Kichel. Now Goering
tells the army that these generals
are weaklings and traitors
who should not be obeyed. The
lieutenant in the field and the
commander at sea must check
with Himmler or Doenitz to see
if the orders from his superiors
are to be followed. This is not
the beginning of the end; it is
the very heart of the end.

The imminent Russian threat
to East Prussia is also a powerful
reminder of the difference
between the old army and the
Nazi party. East Prussia is holy
ground to the military caste.
It means nothing to Hitler, the
Austrian.

In East Prussia are the ancestral
homes of many military
families. Centuries ago it was
the seat of the Prussian knights.
To the traditional military
mind, a party like the Nazis is
an upstart; its morals are
cloudy; its ideology unintelligible;
its leaders amateurs; and
its fate wholly immaterial.
We shall soon see the bloody
proof of this distinction in Germany.
