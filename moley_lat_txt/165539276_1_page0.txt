POLAND'S PITTSBURGH

Despite the psychological
value of Warsaw, the major
phase of Russian fighting in
Poland is that aimed at and be-
yond Krakow, the ancient Polish
capital. Beyond Krakow and
Czestochowa, the holy shrine
of Poland, is the eastern "Ruhr"
of the Germans, the heart of
their economic machine. North-
west of Krakow and 30 miles
west of Kielce, which the Rus-
sians took in the first days of
their offensive, is the first of the
Polish coal mines.
Before the war Poland pro-
duced considerably more coal in
this area than she needed and
she exported quantities through
the Baltic ports. After Hitler
overran that region more than
five years ago, he organized
there a tremendous cluster of
steelworks, armament factories
and some oil works. The re-
gion probably produces almost
a quarter of all the coal now
produced in German-held terri-
tory. With the United States
and Britain on the west and Rus-
sia on the east pressing on the
twin Ruhrs, decisive events may
be near. It is not necessary to
bring the two pincers together
in Berlin to smother the Ger-
man carcass. The lifeblood of
the Reich is coal, and when that
goes all goes.
