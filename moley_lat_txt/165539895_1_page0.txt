Pattern in
Nazi Killings

BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the German officers
recently hanged by Hitler for
alleged conspiracy was a young
lieutenant named York von
Wartenburg. His inclusion
among the group makes clear
that the Nazis are not murder-
ing for murder's sake. Their
murders have a symbolic pat-
tern. They were telling the
German people something when
they killed York von Warten-
burg, and there is no doubt that
his death has created a sensa-
tion in Germany.
One of the ancestors of Yor
von Wartenburg was a Pru-
sian general. His name, too,
was York von Wartenburg.
When Napoleon decided to at-
tack Russia in 1812, the Prus-
sian king commanded Gen. von
Wartenburg to take his army
and join the French. The gen-
eral did that with definite mis-
givings. Finally, he saved his
army from the great rout by
promptly, in defiance of his
king, making a treaty of friend-
ship with the Russians. And
incidentally, he made that
treaty near Tilsit, on a spot
which is now within the east-
ern fighting front.
His purpose was the liber-
ation of East Prussia from Na-
poleon's dictatorship. His let-
ter to the king is known to
German schoolchildren because
of its remarkable ending:
"Should I have done wrong,"
he wrote, "I put my head at
the disposal of Your Majesty."
Nevertheless, his head was
saved, and his movement for
liberation succeeded. His de-
scendant was not equally fortu-
nate.

SCAPEGOAT PROVIDED
Of what value to Hitler is this
dead Prussian? The question
suggests Tom Sawyer's trade of
a dead cat to a friend. The boy
after the acquisition, asked
Tom, "By the way, what are
dead cats good for?" And Tom
answered, "To cure warts with.
Hitler's use of von Warten-
burg's and of Field Marshal von
Witzleben's death is obviously
to have an equally magical pur-
pose. It is to provide a scape-
goat for the defeat of Germany
â€”a scapegoat to be used when
after a spell of years, the Nazi
leaders believe that they may
again have to be shouting
themselves back into power.
Before this, the whipping
boys were the Jews. But no
Jews are left. Next time, it will
be the Junkers. And so these
hangings are reserve material
for future Nazi speeches.
The calculation with which
the killings were accomplished
is further shown by the method
of execution. The condemned
officers asked to be shot or be-
headed, for it has been the
proud privilege of the nobility
to be killed by an ax or a
sword, as it has been that of a
soldier to be shot. The humble
hemp is for beggars and thieves.
The Fuehrer used hanging as
a further means of impressing
upon his superstitious people
that the East Prussian nobility
is no longer essential to Ger-
many.
