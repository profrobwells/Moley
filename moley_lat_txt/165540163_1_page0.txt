What About
Surpluses?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While Mr. Chester Bowles
tells us that we must retain
his mammoth price control of-
fice for two years after the war,
Mayor LaGuardia tells us that
we should destroy such surplus
materials as will not provide
employment for warworkers.
Thus the New Deal administra-
tion in which Mr. Bowles is an
official, and of which Mr. La-
Guardia is an ardent supporter,
stands at the opposite poles of
economic prediction. Mr. Bowles
is afraid of inflation, Mr. La-
Guardia of deflation.
Mr. LaGuardia foresees in sur-
plus something very real, which
is a pile of stuff made for the
Army, but immediately usable
by civilians. This surplus has
been estimated to be worth $15.-
000.000.000. It includes about
$2.500.000.000 in foodstuffs, and
$1,000,000,000 in shoes, textiles,
clothing and blankets. This is
more than the value of all such
goods in all the wholesale ware-
houses in the country.
A PROTECTION
It is a complete protection
against the sort of inflation for
which Mr. Bowles would retain
70,000 employees. Instead of de-
stroying this stuff, as Mr. La-
Guardia suggests, why should
we not use it to control the in-
flation that Mr. Bowles fears?
Even if we destroyed it, as
Mr. LaGuardia suggests, we
should not help employment
much. For all this stuff repre-
sents only a little more than
two months' American war pro-
duction. What would Mr. La-
Guardia suggest as a cure for
unemployment after the de-
stroyed goods have been re-
placed? Surely, he would not
follow Hitler's suggestion of
tearing down cities and rebuild-
ing them.
At this point we introduce an-
other New Dealer, Dr. Alvin
Hansen. In the course of utter-
ing many fallacies, Dr. Hansen
occasionally drops an egg of
good common sense. He said
that we can really contribute
to full employment if we lift
some of the taxes from the
business structure.
OTHER SUGGESTIONS
Dr. Hansen did not make the
following suggestions, but they
may be added to his formula.
We can ease the tax burden by
reducing somewhat the national
debt. Why not sell the surplus
and apply the funds to a begin-
ning of debt liquidation? Then
sell those war plants that are
salable and reduce the debt
some more? This would be mov-
ing, however falteringly, to-
ward more employment through
somewhat lower taxes.
But what is more likely to
happen is that, the New Deal
will combine the two remedies
of Brothers Bowles and La-
Guardia by keeping the big Price
Administration pay roll, holding
the surplus off the market to
keep prices up and, in addition,
paying people for not working.
This will increase the debt some
more, will eventually promote
inflation and give Mr. Bowles
more to do. This is the vicious
circle that New Dealers call the
new economics.
