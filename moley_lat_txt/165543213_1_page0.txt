Adolph A. Berle, Assistant
Secretary of State, makes a poor
job of answering Gov. Dewey's
attack on him. His letter to the
President centers on Mr. Dew-
ey's quotation from Mr. Berle's
statement, which read: "Over a
period of years, the government
will come to own most of the
productive plants of the United
States." Mr. Dewey's comment
on this was: "That means, of
course, a system where govern-
ment would tell each of us
where we could work, at what,
and for how much. Now, I do
not know whether my opponent
calls that system Communism
or National Socialism or Fas-
cism. He can take it any way
he likes it."
And now, no dount because
he was told to do so by the
White House, Mr. Berte comes
back with a statement which
is as specious as his original
statement made to the T.N.E.C.
was frank.
CREATING WEALTH?
In another place in the Berle
T.N.E.C. memorandum, he says,
"If it be true, as apparently it
is, that the private capital mar-
kets are not providing the neces-
sary flow of capital toward ac-
tual construction of tangible
economic wealth, and in place
of it the government is under-
taking to do the job, we have to
face certain definite effects."
These "definite effects," as
Berle describes them, are that
"the danger of a breakdown in
the government credit" can be
"discounted." Then he says that
governinent debt creates wealth
and that private credit cannot
create enough wealth. Then
comes the whole passage from
which Mr. Dewey quoted:
"Briefly, the government will
have to enter into the direct
financing of activities now sup-
posed to be private: and a con-
tinuance of that direct financ-
ing must be inevitably that the
government ultimately will con-
trol and own those activities.
Put differently, if the govern-
ment undertakes to create
wealth by using its own credit
at the rate of $1,000,000,000 or
so a year, and if its work is well
done, the government will be
acquiring direct productive
mechanisms at the rate of
$1,000,000,000 worth a year, or
thereabouts. Over a period of
years, the government will grad-
ually come to own most of the
productive plants of the United
States."
FOOLING NOBODY
I am quite familiar with the
Berle memorandum in question.
It was presented in 1939, and I
wrote a reply calling it "eco-
nomic totalitarianism." I knew
Mr. Berle himself in the early
days of the New Deal. He was
then completely free with posi-
tive assertions that the original
New Deal would not work and
that a vastly more radical pro-
gram would be necessary. He
made clear that such a program
would end in virtual collectiv-
ism.
He is fooling none of those
who know him with his letter
of protest.
