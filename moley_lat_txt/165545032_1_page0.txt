The Negroes
at the Polls
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is one problem facing
the Democrats in the northern
cities that cannot be cleared,
even "through Sidney." It is
the great danger that Mr. Roose-
velt's control of the Negro vote
may melt away in a wave of
Negro unemployment.
Negro organizations are al-
ready putting plenty of heat on
the Democrats.
AN ULTIMATUM
Walter White, speaking for
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
recently presented this ultima-
tum to the House and Senate
committees which have before
them bills to create a perma-
nent fair employment practice
committee:
"National Association for Ad-
vancement of Colored People
has read your statement that
action on bill for permanent
F.E.P.C. has been delayed by
your committee because of num-
ber of witnesses wanting to be
heard. We submit facts of racial
discrimination in employment
are well known. Because end
of war in Europe is now in
sight and because estimated 50
per cent reduction in war pro-
duction will present a crisis in
employment, we urge you tele-
graph witnesses who wish to
testify and have not been heard
to send statements to your com-
mittee and, on basis of testimony
already taken, report the bill
to the House and urge passage
now. Similar action is being
urged upon Senate committee.
We believe majority of Negro
Americans, while recognizing
sponsorship your party has giv-
en to F.E.P.C., will regard any
delay as bad faith on part of
the (Democratic) party."
Behind this demand is the
stark fact that when employ-
ment is cut back Negroes will
be heavily represented among
those who lose jobs. Their sen-
iority is very low and employ-
ers are bound by union con-
tracts to observe the rules of
seniority in dismissing workers.
In one city an occupational plan-
ning committee was asked by a
joint Negro-white organization
to ask employers to keep Ne-
groes on pay rolls during de-
mobilization at a ratio of 9 to 1.
DILEMMA FOR ALL
In short, because the Negro
population constituted one-tenth
of the city's population, it was
requested that such a ratio pre-
vail after cutbacks and after the
return of the soldiers. This di-
lemma will face employers, un-
ions, civic organizations and the
Democratic party before elec-
tion.
So far, appeals by employers
and civic organizations to the
Federal government have been
unavailing. The government
gives the empty answer that
it wants "full employment." But
this will not satisfy demands
like that expressed by White.
If ever there has been a case
in New Deal history when
loose promises have come home
to roost, it is this,
