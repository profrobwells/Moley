The President's decision to run
again has proved one thing that
his opponents said in 1910. It
shows that once such a prece-
dent as the prohibition against
the third term is broken, there
remains no self-imposed limit on
personal ambition. From there
on, only the people---Mr. Roose-
velt's "commander-in-chief-
and Father Time, who com-
mands even the voters, can set
a limit on personal power in
this country.
When a man reaches a de-
cision, we look in two places for
motives: Most important is the
nonrational motive, which mani-
fests itself in habit or instinct.
In Mr. Roosevelt's case, this has
shown itself in his activism. He
is no philosopher, no lover of
solitude. For 35 years he has
lived a life of exciting political
adventure. After that period,
habit simply takes over.
'GREAT DESIGN'
A second motive in any de-
cision is the reason which a per-
son admits to himself or to his
close friends. In Mr. Roosevelt's
case, those who know him best
believe that he sees himself as a
man with a mission or missions.
The mission in the first six years
of his service was domestic re-
form. It was the New Deal.
Since 1938 the mission has been
International. The new big idea
is his Great Design-a somewhat
cloudy mixture of Wilsonism,
Wallaceism and imperialism.
Because it is cloudy, it is dan-
gerous; but precisely because it
is cloudy and big, Mr. Roosevelt
loves it.
The nonrational impulse and
the privately held reason are the
motives, and basically they differ
little from those which moved
other ambitious men in the past.
The publicly given reasons are
campaign material. Even those
ardent supporters who approved
know such public reasons for
what they are. They know, and
I have heard these men say so
over and over, that talk of the
desire to return to the droning
solitude of Hyde Park is the
bunk. Even the feeling of obli-
gation to lead the people as an
excuse, they maintain, is hard to
take at face value.
RECKLESS COURAGE
But one thing the supporters
of the President know better
than his opponents. Mr. Roose-
velt is a man of courage-of
utter, even reckless, courage.
Even if he anticipated defeat, he
would take the risk, the personal
as well as the official risk, of
running again.
That his passionate belief in
his reforms should cause him to
favor Mr. Wallace is quite prob-
able. He may not insist upon it
as he did before, but of all the
candidates so far mentioned for
Vice-President, Mr. Wallace pre-
sents the greatest affinity for the
President's views. Because Mr.
Wallace has ideological qualities
as well as personal ambition, he
has an advantage in a broken
field. For no other candidate
for second place is moved by
anything other than stark, naked
ambition. Even the thin veneer
of ideology does not clothe that
ambition. The other candidates
just want the job.
