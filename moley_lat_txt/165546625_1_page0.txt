The Willkie
Monuments
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has been clear since 1940
that the great role that Wendell
Willkie might play in American
life could not be as a candidate
or as a holder of public office.
Whether or not he was aware
of it, his independent conduct
had closed the road to party or
public office for him.
A true party leader must weld
into unity the views and senti-
ments of millions of voters and
hundreds of leaders. This takes
patience, forbearance and a
subordination of personal views
and ambitions to the general
purposes of unity. Mr. Willkie
was within his rights in refus-
ing to do these things. But in
making that choice he must
have known that he was clos-
ing the way to an official career.
One cannot be a bishop and a
free thinker, too.
A NEW HORIZON
But independence of the sort
that he enjoyed opened a vast
horizon of usefulness to him as
a publicist, a stimulant to pub-
lic thinking and an irritant to
both political parties. Ultimate-
ly, like Bryan before him, he
might have accepted that role,
which he would have filled with
distinction and force. The coun-
try needs such free lances, and
the untimely end of Wendell
Willkie is a distinct loss to us
all.
Whether Mr. Willkie had com-
prehended this opportunity to
be useful outside of both par-
ties after his Wisconsin defeat
may never be known. But the
frustration of his efforts to cap-
lure a second nomination should
have made it very clear indeed.
HIS MONUMENTS
The choice made both by Re-
publican leaders and by Repub-
lican voters in preferring Mr.
Dewey to Mr. Willkie was a fear-
some one. Most Republican lead-
ers had no animosity toward
their 1940 choice, but profound-
ly believed, in 1944, that he
could not win. Others were an-
gry because Mr. Willkie had
neglected them. But all decided
that Mr. Dewey would be the
best candidate. in spite of their
fear that Mr. Willkie might op-
pose their choice. That Mr. Will-
kie's open opposition might
grievously injure Republican
chances in November has been
admitted everywhere. Fate has
now answered the question of
what Mr. Willkie might or might
not have done, and party unity
is assured. Mr. Dewey's interna-
tional views go far enough to
satisfy practically every former
supporter of Mr. Willkie. These
supporters can now join the
Dewey cause with confidence
and vigor.
Mr. Willkie imprinted his in-
fluence deeply on the Repub-
lican party, despite the short-
ness of his association with it.
That influence will remain as
one of the many things which
he left as monuments to his en-
ergy, forthrightness and inde-
pendence.
