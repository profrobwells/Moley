Hillman's
Vote Trap
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Apparently Brother Hillman
has invented a better vote trap,
and even such trained vote
snarers as Hague, Kelly and
Flynn will soon be making a
path to his door. If his Political
Action Committee, as he claims,
is not a political party, then a
lot of people seeking election
have been fooling away their
time operating through political
parties. The P.A.C. is geared to
get people to register, to tell
them how to vote, and then to
see that they vote. What, pray
tell, is a political outfit for, if
not for those things?
It is important at this moment
not to dismiss the P.A.C.
because it failed to nominate
Mr. Wallace for Vice-President.
In trying to do that, it faced
enormous odds. The two wings
of the Democratic party, the
South and the northern city
bosses, were squarely against it.
Besides Mr. Hillman found that
his coworker, Mr. Roosevelt, is
prone to change his mind when
political dangers appear.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT
Finally, Mr. Hillman found
that his helpers in the big convention
floor battle were bungling
amateurs. He will learn later
how to manage a convention.
But obviously he already knows
what needs to be known between
now and November. It is to
persuade and cajole every available
Roosevelt voter to go to the
polls and be counted.
In the course of years I have
seen many of the most efficient
political machines in action.
But this Hillman affair is something
new and strange and formidable.
What has it got that the parties
haven't got? Several things.
• First, a well-paid staff of organizers
who have, in a few years, gathered
several million workers into a labor
organization which makes them pay
fat dues.
ITS ASSETS
Next, a group of very well paid
writers who can get out pamphlets
dressed out in simple, powerful
language anyone can understand.
It also publishes its directives to
precinct and shop leaders and
solicitors in such detail and with
such directness that the power of
the central office will ramify into
every home and every club and
workroom in the areas covered.
Its political arguments would not
stand the test of logic, but they
are shrewd, plausible and simple
to grasp.
It has men like Hillman at the top,
who know thoroughly how various
radical political movements in Europe
were carried to success.
Finally, it has a whale of a lot of
money—more than either party now
possesses, perhaps more than both
together.
Organization. Republicans who know
something of the Hillman setup entertain
no doubts about its potential power. And
Democrats who do not favor turning their
party into a class movement are profoundly
disturbed lest this ally become their master.
