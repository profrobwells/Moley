Wallace
and Jones
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is futile business trying to
determine a "rightist" or "left-
ist" White House trend by
examining recent Federal ap-
pointments. Trends have never
been established that way. Mr.
Roosevelt is probably mainly
concerned, these days, about get-
ting a few younger and more
competent human beings into
jobs which cry loudly for the
doing.
That is why the appointments
will be of all colorsâ€”some con-
servative, some radical. Selec-
tions will be made for all man-
ner of reasons other than
ideology. Sections need to be
placated. Campaign debts must
be paid off. Senators must be
kept in line for foreign policy
purposes, Murray and Hillman
must not be offended.
JONES ON BLACKLIST
Meanwhile, there is the strong-
arm squad, some official and
some on the outside, whose pur-
pose is to knock off a number
of people whom New Dealers
regard as reactionary. High on
their blacklist is the Hon. Jesse
H. Jones. Age and somewhat
impaired health is on the side of
the purgers here. Mr. Jones has
resisted all efforts to drive him
from office over many years.
But his enemies are persistent.
They have few scruples about
method. They have made prog-
ress, but the best opinion is that
Mr. Jones will hold on for a
while. His friends believe that
if the pressure gets very heavy
he may leave the Commerce De-
partment and hold on to his old
love, the chairmanship of the
R.F.C. He has always valued
that job more highly than his
Cabinet post. His record there
is a monument to sagacity and
soundness.
But to vacate the Commerce
Secretaryship will not assure the
job for the earlier purged Mr.
Wallace. Rumor has it that the
Vice-President got some assur-
ance of a selection of jobs. He
has a political claim on some-
thing good. His friends in labor
are strong.
CERTAIN CONFLICT
Radicals everywhere see him
as their hope in 1948. And Her-
bert Hoover once demonstrated
how the Commerce Department
could be a path to the White
House. It is hardly likely, how-
ever, that if Mr. Roosevelt felt
that Mr. Wallace was so great
a political liability that he should
be kept off the ticket in July, he
would regard him, six months
later, as a prospective heir. That
is not the way the President's
mind works. Moreover, he prob-
ably wants as little intrigue and
friction in his Cabinet as possi-
ble, and certainly the appoint-
ment of Mr. Wallace would set
off four years of political con-
flict in the party and in the ad-
ministration.
It is hardly possible that a
President who seeks peace in his
own official family would choose
Mr. Wallace, or that the Senate
would approve such a choice.
