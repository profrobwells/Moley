Where Lies
the Fault?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
To note that the Bretton
Woods conference is going very
badly is not to admit internation-
al co-operation is a hopeless
venture. It is merely to note
that Messrs. Roosevelt and Mor-
genthau have failed to provide
reat American leadership for an
undertaking so serious as the
monetary conference. If this is
a sample of the work of the
"indispensable leader" in the
postwar settlements, the United
States had better change horses
as soon as possible.
The American delegation is
supposed to bring about the
adoption of a plan with which
few Americans are familiar and
which responsible American ex-
perts have declared to be un-
sound. Our delegation is in-
structed by the President to
work within that plan. Con-
fronting our delegation is the
clever and articulate Lord
Keynes, whom many Americans
believe to be the source of the
most radical New Deal financial
ideas. This is not a situation de-
signed to win the confidence of
the American public in these
days of stress and anxiety.
CAN REST ASSURED
But the people of this country
can rest assured on one point.
Whatever apprehension they feel
that Britain may be a serious
economic adversary after the
war is equaled by Britain's fears
about us. This was made abun-
dantly clear in Lord Keynes'
final speech to his own country-
men before he came to the con-
ference.
Speaking on May 23, he ex-
plained his own plans to a rath-
er jittery House of Lords. He
was at pains to say his opinions
about the gold standard had not
changed: "If I have any author-
ity to pronounce on what is and
what is not the meaning of a
gold standard, I should say that
this plan is the exact opposite of
it."
He assured his country, more-
over, that his plan would not
prevent the continuance of the
sterling bloc, with all the em-
pire restrictions and preferences
that might be necessary to Brit-
ish interests.
A FIRM GRIP
That is just about what the
Republican platform said for us.
It said, in brief, that we propose
to meet any disposition of other
countries to discriminate against
us by retaining a firm grip on
our own markets through our
tariffs, subject to every effort
we can make by international
agreement to promote interna-
tional trade.
The administration might have
kept the conference out of pol-
itics had the President been will-
ing to send to Bretton Woods a
delegation genuinely representa-
tive not only of his views but
also of that substantial banking
and business community which
disagrees with his monetary
policies. It would have helped
things, too, If the President had
made it clear that this confer-
ence is exploratory and tentative.
Instead, he said the conference
was to be the test of our ability
to co-operate with other nations.
