Mr. Dewey's
Attitude
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
LOS ANGELES—There have
been some unjustified complaints
that Mr. Dewey has
failed to take a sufficiently
positive stand against the entire
economic record of the New
Deal. The critics who say this
assert that a pledge to retain
any considerable part of the
policies advocated by the President
and enacted by Congress
in the last 11 years makes Mr.
Dewey a mere carbon copy of Mr.
Roosevelt. The same situation
appeared in 1936 and in 1910,
and Messrs. Landon and Willkie
were similarly criticized.
The fact is that a compulsion
rests on both candidates to accept
certain economic conclusions
that have been created by
no political decisions at all. They
are inherent in the economic
system itself and in what the
public thinks about its economic
system.
POINTS OF UNITY
Neither Mr. Dewey nor Mr.
Roosevelt is for the old-fashioned
free market. Neither is
willing to permit a sharp downward
pressure on wages. Neither
is willing to permit another
depression in farm prices.
Neither will permit the consequence
of quick technical progress
in a free-market economy,
which may be the displacement
of workers. Both say that the
government will have to find
jobs to supplement those created
by private employment. In
short, both are for full employment,
but both admit that full
employment is inconsistent with
nonintervention by government.
There are two reasons for
this large area of agreement in
the speeches of the two candidates.
One is inherent in the
art of getting votes. The plain
fact is that the average American,
either in agriculture, labor,
or management, is unwilling
to have the hard facts presented
to him by a candidate for
office. He will take such facts
from others, but not from politicians.
Whenever a politician
tells him unpleasant things, he
will claim that such utterances
destroy the confidence on which
his job rests or his prices depend.
AN EXAMPLE
The other reason was well
stated in 1920 by an official of
the Republican government in
Germany, in answer to a Socialist
named Wissel (who was,
by the way, the father of the
term “planned economy”). The
Socialist charged the official
with following wrong economic
policies, and the official answered
that 95 per cent of all
economic policy is imposed on
government by the economic
needs of the public, and not on
the public by government, and
that this condition prevails, regardless
of the party in power.
The best example that we
have of this is in the conditions
which brought the Hoover administration
to create the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation. It was recognized
by Mr.
Hoover that as long as the
credit of the government was
sound, the public expected its
government to prevent the liquidation
of certain essential
private enterprises. And the
Roosevelt administration found
the R.F.C. the most valuable
of all its emergency agencies.
It is fraudulent to claim that
the credit should go to the New
Deal for this institution.
CAN HE LAUGH IT OFF?
The best point of distinction
that Mr. Dewey has made is
that, while he agrees with a
large measure of government
intervention in private economic
life, the New Deal administration,
from the President
down, has no confidence
in the possibility of limiting
that intervention and, if that
confidence does not exist in government,
there will be an unending
effort to extend that intervention
in pursuit of the illusion
of security.
In short, the New Deal should
be condemned for its attitudes
vastly more than for its legislative
enactments. That is
sound ground for a distinction,
and if that point is pressed
home, Mr. Roosevelt will have
a hard time laughing it off.
