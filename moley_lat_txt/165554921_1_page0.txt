Tokyo's
Fire Hazard
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Americans who were consulted
20 years ago when Tokyo was
rebuilding after the earthquake
fire of 1923 know some interesting
facts about the inflammability
of the city. The Japanese
government had in Tokyo a job
of rebuilding and replanning
probably more extensive than in
any other city in modern times.
All dictates of prudence suggested
rebuilding with solid, fire-
resistant materials. But the resources
of the island kingdom
were limited. There just wasn't
enough money to build a safe
city. So the Japanese compromised
by building a number of
wide avenues radiating from the
center. These avenues were
lined with solid, fire-resistant
materials.
TERROR SHOWN
The rest of the vast area of
the city filled up with typical
Japanese housing, inflammable
and impermanent. With favoring
winds, a general fire could consume
any one of the great pieces
of Tokyo pie, yet be stopped by
the protective avenues. This
vulnerability, no doubt, has contributed
to the terror manifested
by the Japanese toward air attacks.
Reports from Japanese
sources confirm the Japanese
sense of vulnerability. Mention
of fires appears constantly. Japan,
they say, is "very vulnerable."
People are told not to
become "overnervous, because if
we do we will be caught in the
evil designs of the enemy."
Most significant is a Domei
statement that "at this time
of enemy bombings when there
is demand for indestructible cities,
much hope is being placed in
fireproof apartment houses."
They apparently have at least
one such house, which was built
on Kyushu Island last year.
Their hope, therefore, is in the
dream houses they failed to
build long ago.
AREAS RAZED
Further evidence of Tokyo's
plight comes in reports that
large areas are being razed to
provide breaks against fires started
by Superfortress raids.
It is to be hoped that American
propaganda agencies in the
Far East did not fail to remind
the Japanese that the recent
earthquake, which Japanese
called "catastrophic," fell on the
third anniversary of Pearl Harbor.
Also, that this indicated a
gesture from the Father of the
Son of Heaven that the Japanese
government had been very bad
to start a war against a nation
that can rain fire from the
clouds.
Tokyo is the nerve center of
a nation we must defeat, and
despite all talk of their iron
fatalism, the Japanese are susceptible
not only to fear of material
danger, but to superstitious
terrors as well. The very roots
of their fatalism lie in superstition,
which can provide the
basis of fear as well as of courage.
People who live in bamboo
houses should not throw bombs.
