The Future
of Germany
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As winter settles down over
increasingly bitter warfare in
Western and Southern Europe,
the brightest news that Ameri-
cana could get immediately
ahead would be that of an agree-
ment among the Allies as to
the future of Germany. Darkness
on this subject remains
among the American and Brit-
ish people, in Germany and in
the battling armies. The Mor-
genthau plan, which it now
seems originated with the Van-
sittart school in England, has
had marked opposition here and
within the fighting forces who
are giving so much at the front.
That idea of turning Germany
back to a pastoral past appar-
ently brought to new life a deep-
ly ingrained fear among Ger-
mans of all classes.
A LITTLE HISTORY
A little German history ex-
plains the source of that fear
of a throwback. A hundred
years ago, even after the influ-
ence of the French Revolution
and the temporary power of Na-
poleon brought some nominal
liberty to the incredibly
wretched and despised farm la-
borers of Germany, their situa-
tion remained that of half slaves.
The great German writer, Fritz
Reuter, at that time wrote a
heartrending poem about the
vassals on the Junker estates.
It describes a farm laborer, un-
able to get even a shelter from
his Junker master, who, in vio-
lation of law, started his 5-year-
old boy, at night and in a storm,
on a trip to America. There,
the father said, "he shall be
free."
Such classic descriptions of
past times have become a part
of the folklore of the German
people. It is no wonder that
Goebbels tries now to picture
Americans as oppressors and to
destroy the earlier German con-
ceptions of America as a land
of freedom, at the same time
that he draws pictures of Ger-
mans reduced to the serfdom
of a century ago.
IN A STRAIT JACKET?
Such angles of German psy-
chology were taken into account
in Wilson's appeals in 1918. Wil-
son knew his history and he
turned the suspicions of Ger-
mans against their own Junker
class. He pictured the Allies as
liberators and he broke a bloody
stalemate. Apparently, our prop-
aganda today works in a
strait jacket created by the fail-
ure of the heads of the Allied
governments to come to any
agreement about what the con-
ditions of unconditional surren-
der really are.
There is enough imagination
surely, in the British and Amer-
ican propaganda service to drive
a wedge between the wretched
Nazi small fry and the oppressed
people whom they have oppressed.
Let us hope, with Churchill,
that there may very soon be a
meeting of minds among the
heads of states. And that the
first fruits of such a meeting
will be a clear means of break-
ing the unity of Germany. The
alternative is a bloody winter
war.
