Tom Dewey has taken plenty
of beatings in his short public
career, but every time he has
come back to win his objective.
He has character, courage and
youth. He wants no personal
sympathy. He knew the odds
he was facing and he knew he
had a good chance to lose. But
his acceptance of the risk carried
with it a certainty. That
certainty is that, win or lose the
election, he could, by running,
reconstruct the Republican party.
That lesser job he will most certainly
do in the four years ahead.
And if the past is any criterion,
he will ultimately win the Presidency
as well.
He lost his prosecution of
Jimmy Hines in 1938 by a mistrial.
But he came back and
convicted his man. In the same
year, he lost the Governorship
of New York. But he won it
four years later. He lost the
nomination in 1940, but won it
in 1944. So please omit flowers.
This is the beginning, not the
end.
THE WAR FACTOR
Mr. Dewey cannot legitimately
be blamed--even in a detail--for
his defeat. Mr. Roosevelt won
because of nothing Mr. Dewey
did or left undone. And Mr.
Roosevelt's margin of advantage
in the returns would have been
a big deficit, except for factors
which neither candidate created.
The war, with its special impact
on the East, and the fear of a
change were the largest factors
in this election. Except for
these things, Mr. Dewey's victory
would have been colossal.
Mr. Dewey stated the case for
a change with force, eloquence
and with meticulous care. No
candidate could have done it so
well.
And his running mate, John
W. Bricker, has emerged as a
big, durable and nationally respected
figure.
FIGHTERS ADMIRED
The country admires fighters
of the Dewey-Bricker breed.
They have together earned twice
over the leadership of their
party. Their future influence
will be very great. They have
revitalized the minority party.
It will become what it failed to
become in years past--an organized
loyal opposition to which
the people can turn with confidence
and which, in every national
crisis, can become the
supporter of national objectives.
There will be many amateur
post-mortems over the Dewey-
Bricker speeches.
The issue was in the presence,
in this country, of a regime
which asked for unprecedented
power and unprecedented length
of life. It was the job of the candidates
to say why the continuation
of that power should not
be given. The people decided
that the incumbent regime
should continue in power.
The public education Dewey
and Bricker provided will give
to millions the means of judging
the future actions of their government.
For it still is the people's
government.
