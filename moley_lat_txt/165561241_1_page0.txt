Turkey's foreign policy is
very simple: It is determined
that when the Allies assemble
at the peace table, Turkey will
be in a chair and not on a platter. No nation ever had a group
of rulers who played their cards
more carefully, more coldly,
more consistently and with
more regard for their national
interests than Turkey. Time
may prove that they were
eminently successful.
At one time or another in past
centuries Poles and Lithuanians
were masters of great empires.
So were the Turks. But, unlike
modern Poles and Lithuanians,
modern Turks waste no time
mooning over past glories. Pan-
Islamism is dead, and there are
no mourners. Mustafa Kemal,
alias Ataturk, alias the Ghazi,
decided that more than 20 years
ago, and the successors and disciples of Kemal, President Ismet
Inonu and Prime Minister
Sukru Saracoglu have made it
the primary principle in the
state.
A BAD DREAM
The Turks regard the ancient
Turkish empire as a dream and
a bad dream at that. The old
Turkey was, as Saracoglu told
an American newspaperman
two years ago, a conglomerate
human mass in which Turks
were a thoroughly hated minority. The new Turkey is based
on the idea of a compact nation
inhabited by Turks and operated by and for Turks. The Turkish
leaders call this, "constructive nationalism."
Another ancient faith of the
Turk is dead. The old Turks
believed in war. Fighting was
their business. They did pretty
well with it for several centuries. But now their business
is to stay out of wars or to stay
out at least until all danger is
over. Americans, Russians and
the British have no great admiration for the way the Turks
have hesitated in the present
instance. But the Turks are not
disturbed about that.
TURKEY FOR TURKS
Only one characteristic has
been saved from the ancient
Turks. The habit of coldly calculated diplomacy is just as
marked now in Turkish affairs
as it was in the days of Suleiman the Magnificent. Von
Papen, the most accomplished
liar in Germany, spent years in
fruitless activity in Ankara. He
dashed his great talents against
a rubber wall. The Turks helped
the Germans just enough to keep
them away, but not enough to
bring the Russians in.
ISLANDS NOT WANTED
Just before the war, in 1939,
the French gave to Turkey a
small protectorate, Alexandrette,
of which the principal town is
the famous Antioch. The Turks
were pleased. Later, the Allies
hinted that Turkey might have
Mussolini's Dodecanese Islands
as the price for her entering the
war. The Turks did not mention Greeks bearing gifts. They
said the proffered gift was
Greek. The islands were inhabited by Greeks. Turkey had
gone out of the empire business.
No thanks. No dice.
Now it appears that the time
has come for a dignified change
in Turkey's legal relations with
Germany. Legally, it is war.
Actually, it will mean little in
military aid. But the new Turkey responds to the beckoning
of fate. Turkey first Kismet!
