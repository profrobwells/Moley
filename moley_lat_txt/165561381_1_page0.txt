The administrative side of
Washington is all atwitter about
what to do with the nice
mandate received at the elec
tion. Apparently its plans have
the infinite variety which char
acterizes the planners them-
selves. There are thousands of
Ideas with no co-ordination.
Hence, reports of what is ahead
still come in terms of ominous
generalities, such as more "so-
cial progress," new "social hori-
zons," "hold economic experi-
mentation" and so forth.
But later, after the new Con-
gress meets, a few things will
emerge, and the President, who
no doubt thinks he is called
upon to "push forward," will
look around for promising ideas
to promote. Bear in mind the
certainty that he will not stand
still, for he is not that kind of
man. His "program" will prob-
ably be an assortment of recom-
mendations. In its totality it
will be the newest of the New
Deals. Historians disagree about
how many New Deals we have
had in the past 12 years, but
they agree that we have had
several. My own guess is three.
Now we shall have the fourth.
NOT EASY TO DO
Watchful Congressmen and
other observers who have a
sense of political values can de-
rive some amusement and no
little instruction from speculat-
ing, as the proposals roll in dur-
ing the next two years, how
difficult it is going to be to fit
new reforms into the pattern of
Mr. Roosevelt's new city-south-
ern party alliance. It will not
be easy for him, since most of
what he will be urged to do
will not help him to hold his
northern cities in line political-
ly.
Nor will these recommenda-
tions help him provide the 60,-
000,000 jobs he promised, un-
less he decides to compel a
mass transmigration of war
workers and returning veterans
—sort of national socialism
which can hardly be anticipat-
ed in light of the kind of Con-
gress he will face.
OF LITTLE VALUE
Suppose he decides to push
the St. Lawrence Seaway and
the seven new valley authori-
ties, for example. The T.V.A.
was good politics in its day be-
cause it solidified Democratic
control in Tennessee and in part
of Kentucky—States Mr. Roose-
velt needed to bolster his solid
southern bloc of electoral votes.
But the various proposed val-
ley authorities and the St. Law-
rence project will hardly be of
value even in the long run in
consolidating his city strength.
There isn't a great deal of un-
developed water power within
a reasonable distance from the
cities where the great Roose-
velt vote was located.
Some possible projects, such
as socialized medicine, would be
popular with the people behind
the P.A.C. But to extend pres-
ent social security benefits to
other groups, as suggested by
Gov. Dewey, would help Repub-
lican sections in the main and
might not help the Democrats
enough there to make up for
dissatisfaction in the big cities.
