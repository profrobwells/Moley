Two established principles of
government will meet head on
when the Senate takes up the
nomination of Mr. Henry Wal-
lace as Secretary of Commerce.
The first is the right of the Presi-
dent to choose his own Cabinet.
The second is the right of Amer-
ican business to have a sympa-
thetic Secretary of Commerce.
Senators, whatever their real
reasons for voting, will present
one or the other of these prin-
ciples as a nominal reason. But
before the dilemma of voting
Wallace's confirmation, a Senator
of conscience will probably take
account of all the relative facts
which affect these principles.
And there are many such facts
to be considered.
THE PRECEDENTS
It has long been recognized
that, except in grave circum-
stances, a President may hire or
fire the members of his Cabinet
according to his willâ€”even, ac-
cording to his caprice. Congress
tried to prevent this by law
when President Andrew Johnson
dismissed Secretary of War Stan-
ton. The squabble which ensued
resulted in an impeachment trial
in which Johnson was not re-
moved. For reasons the Senators
thought good and sufficient,
President Coolidge's choice for
Attorney General was rejected.
But the rule is to let the Presi-
dent have the Cabinet he
chooses. The constitutional right
of rejection exists, however, and
hence the Senate must have the
duty to decide whether a choice
violates the purposes for which
a specific Cabinet post was cre-
ated. The rejection of a Presl-
dential appointment may not in-
volve a moral disqualification at
all.
The job of Secretary of Com-
merce is one of a number which
are designed to aid and promote
the legitimate interests of a
specific group in the population.
In this class of Cabinet officers
are the Secretary of Labor, who
concerns herself with the inter-
ests of labor, and the Secretary
of Agriculture, who helps farm-
ers. The other seven Cabinet
members are general officers of
concerned only with carrying out
laws designed to serve all the
people of the nation.
A SERVICE DEPARTMENT
Commerce is a "service" de-
partment. By the terms creating
it and by the nature of its bu-
reaus, it serves the business and
commercial interests of the coun-
try. Its purpose is not to give
orders to business but to give
information and advice to busi-
ness. It promotes the interest of
business by telling it about mar-
kets, by maintaining services
such as lighthouses, steamboat
inspection, patent registration
and the like.
Mr. Wallace may believe that
he is the friend of business, but
it is clear that the business com-
munity does not view him as
one. His speeches and his polit-
ical relations have associated
him with labor and agriculture.
Business, which means the man-
agement and ownership of pri-
vate companies, would, by Mr.
Wallace's appointment, be de-
nied a friend in court.
