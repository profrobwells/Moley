The Shape
of Peace
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gen. de Gaulle apparently
realizes that France has some-
thing more valuable to Russia
now than it will have later on
and that the time to re-establish
the traditional alliance between
the two nations is before the
long game of international chess
that will begin with the making
of peace.
What France has to offer is
not military assistance to Rus-
sia in some far-off day when
Germany may strike again, but
economic assistance in a much
less distant future. French loans
will be useful in reconstructing
Russia, as will be access to the
products of French and French-
controlled factories in the Rhine-
land.
WHAT STALIN WANTS
It must not be assumed that
Stalin seeks by this alliance to
Bolshevize France. Stalin prob-
ably prefers to keep France cap-
italist, and French capitalists
are, no doubt, counting on this.
A world without bankers is ex-
actly what Stalin does not want
in the immediate years ahead.
He prefers a world with some
capitalist countries to lend him
money and with countries that,
under their capitalist economy,
can produce quickly the goods
that he urgently needs. He
would rather have the French
make machines than Commu-
nists. His ideological preferences
can waitâ€”perhaps indefinitely.
All this is why outcries to the
effect that Europe is turning
Communist are premature.
This development of Russian-
French friendship will disturb
some, like Field Marshal Smuts,
who favor a Western European
bloc of democracies to balance
the Eastern European sphere
of Soviet influence. It is not
clear that French statesmanship
ever saw any advantage in the
Smuts plan. The shape of the
Europe to come is to be influ-
enced heavily by the Europe of
the past. And the French-Rus-
sian alliance was a dominant
Continental pattern in the years
of peace before 1914.
A CONTRADICTION?
Anxious Americans will won-
der whether this alliance is a
contradiction of the hopes raised
by the Dumbarton Oaks plan
for a world league. It need not
be, if we recall that the Dum-
barton Oaks idea included re-
gional peace leagues or alliances.
Realistic people have constant-
ly pointed out that a world
league may find its fullest op-
portunity for growth if immedi-
ate peace is assured by geo-
graphically limited leagues or
alliances in specific regions.
The Western Hemisphere pre-
sents the beginnings of such a
regional plan. When the Japa-
nese war is over, another re-
gional problem will present it-
self in Eastern Asia. Africa, the
Near East and the Mediter-
ranean world will also move into
a sphere of unity. Such develop-
ments follow the realistic idea
that world peace must, after all,
be made out of a number of
spheres of peace and orders in
various parts of the world.
