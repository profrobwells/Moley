Foreign Loans
Gain Prestige
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Industrious reporters who,
since election; have been combining
the brains of Washington
forward thinkers have come
away with a lot of familiar material.
It shows how few methods
have been devised to provide
jobs, once you eliminate
the prospect of jobs through a
free economy. And it is clear
that these forward-thinkers, as
always, have eliminated the
restoration of confidence with
less government in business as
a factor in creating employment.
A survey of the best reports
from Washington about the proposals
there to realize the promised
60,000,000 postwar jobs
shows that, in the main, dependence
is placed on two themes:
first, domestic public works; second,
foreign loans to provide
foreign markets for us.
THEY USED TO HOOT
It is interesting to see New
Dealers return to the Coolidge-
Hoover formula of foreign loans.
A few years ago New Dealers
were hooting at these loans.
They said that their domestic
W.P.A. was better than the
Coolidge-Hoover support of foreign
W.P.A.'s, that it was better
to borrow money to build an
American highway than to lend
money to build a German elevated
railroad. Now, however,
the rock cast at poor President
Hoover becomes the keystone
of the New Deal arch of security.
One of the suggestions for foreign
loans is the setting up of
a new lend-lease plan by which
foreign nations will borrow and
then buy from us for their postwar
reconversion and rehabilitation.
BRITISH LOAN?
Ever since the Quebec Conference,
it has been reliably reported
that Britain is negotiating
for a postwar loan of between
three and four billion
dollars. The size of this proposal
makes it clear that something
more than a restoration of Britain's
export trade is being considered.
For, the United Kingdom's
exports, in the years immediately
before the war, were
about two and a half billion dollars
a year. The British claim
that they need a 50 per cent
increase, which brings the total
to less than four billion dollars.
Since customary credit terms
in export trade would not require
the immediate use of the
whole proposed loan in international
trade, it is clear that
a billion or two would be used
for the rehabilitation of Britain
herself. And since additional
loans or lend-lease are suggested,
we would, if the entire proposal
is accepted, be financing
not only a restoration of Britain's
export trade, but a large
domestic program of rehabilitation
and reconversion.
Such loans to Britain are apparently
only a minor part of
the whole program of foreign
lending. There is Russia, for example,
with ideas of still larger
sums, And there are France and
many smaller nations.
The advantage to us of these
loans was suggested by President
Roosevelt in his "horn of
plenty" speech in Chicago. He
then said that we could treble
foreign trade after the war.
