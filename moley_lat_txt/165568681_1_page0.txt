Almost buried in the war
news of the past week was an
account of the outcome of an
amazing Federal criminal prose-
cution of the Chase National
Bank. The acquittal of the bank
raises a very serious question
of why the government should
have moved against the bank at
all.
rise to the indictment of the
bank go back to May, 1940, when
Germany invaded Holland and
Belgium. Shortly after that
event, the President issued an
order freezing the accounts of
Dutch and Belgian nationals in
our banks.
Among the accounts in the
Chase bank was one in the
name of Anton Smit & Co.,
Inc., a New York corporation,
which the bank blocked on the
assumption that it was con-
trolled by a Belgian corporation.
MISTAKE MADE.
However, Leonard J. A. Smit,
an officer of the New York com-
pany, who was Dutch by birth
and on occasion a resident of
Belgium, but who had come to
the United States in 1939, asked
the bank to unfreeze the ac-
count on the ground that the
company was controlled by a
British corporation. The bank
received a written verification
of this fact and released the
account.
But the bank could not rea-
sonably be expected to find out
that the British company was,
A STRANGE PROSECUTION
in turn, controlled or owned by
Smit.
Thus at most a technical mis-
take was made, understandable
in the midst of the bank's ter-
rific job of handling several
thousand blocked accounts in-
volving more than $200,000,000.
CONSPIRACY CHARGED
The Chase bank, Smit, and
certain corporations with which
Smit was connected, were in-
dicted in January, 1944, for con-
spiracy to violate the freezing
order and also for violations of
the freezing order in making
certain payments from the An-
ton Smit & Co., Inc., account
without U.S. Treasury license.
All of the transactions men-
tioned in these indictments oc-
curred prior to Pearl Harbor.
The press release issued by
the Department of Justice quot-
ed the Attorney General as say-
ing, when the indictments were
returned:
"The indictments collectively
charge that Leonard Smit and
his various companies, through
the assistance of the Chase Na-
tional Bank, contrived by illegal
means to trade in industrial dia-
monds in contravention of vari-
ous wartime laws freezing the
funds of certain foreign nation-
als and prohibiting the export
of certain strategic materials."
BLOW TO BANK
Actually, the government con-
ceded in the trial that all of the
transactions complained of oc-
curred before this country en-
tered the war.
It is needless to say that such
a charge in wartime was a seri-
ous embarrassment, not to say
a blow to a bank which through-
out the war has closely co-op-
erated with innumerable de-
mands from the government.
Some notion of the difficulty
and complexity of that co-opera-
tion is conveyed by the fact
that in connection with foreign
accounts alone, the government
in one year issued 196 orders,
amendments, rulings and the
like. The pressure that was on
the bank is obvious. A mechan-
ical slip such as was involved
in this case is understandable.
But this seemed to make no im-
pression on the Justice Depart-
ment or on the Treasury Depart-
ment, which also had a hand in
the bringing of the prosecution.
LET THE FACTS SPEAK
The whole matter was brought
out in a three-weeks' trial, and
the jury acquitted the bank on
all counts. It would seem that
in the midst of war the govern-
ment could find better use for
its energy than a prosecution
like this.
The original charges were, of
course, sensational first - page
news. The acquittal months
later passes almost unnoticed.
It is small wonder that business
institutions feel that their gov-
ernment often uses its power
to inflict unjustified injury upon
them. In this case, the facts
speak for themselves,
