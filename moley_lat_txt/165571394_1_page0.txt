What to Do
With Reich?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
LOS ANGELES.â€”If the re-
port of Secretary Morgenthau's
plan to agriculturize Germany
is correct, his country and every
country in Europe have some-
thing to worry about. Though
the President has backed away
from the plan, sufficient evi-
dence is before us that this ad-
ministration is wholly unpre-
pared for the peace to come.
Such a plan as that attributed
to Mr. Morgenthau would shat-
ter whatever economic balance
will remain in Europe when
peace comes. The Netherlands,
Belgium, Denmark, Sweden,
Switzerland and Austria have
always enjoyed such close finan-
cial and other business relations
with Germany that their eco-
nomic life would be paralyzed
by the Morgenthau plan. In
place of a customer for agricul-
tural and industrial products,
several countries would find in
agricultural Germany an
overpowering competitor.
THE RUHR QUESTION
Probably the Germans could
feed themselves on two and a
half acres a person and, if left
some light industries, they could
make their clothing and some
other things. They would be
left, despite our bombing, with
the great railway system in Eu-
rope, carrying only half its pre-
vious traffic. But the cost of
German coal would rise to a
point beyond the means of many
of the small countries in Eu-
rope. Possibly the United Na-
tions could manage the Ruhr
better than the French did in
1923-24, but that is doubtful.
Consider the effect on non-
German Europe of a nation such
as ours riding into the Conti-
nent with such a Carthaginian
peace, indifferent to the conse-
quences of our force on all na-
tions, including Great Britain.
MANY PLANS
We have now had from the
members of the administration
many divergent plans for paci-
fying Germany. Each member
of the Cabinet probably could
present some such plan based
on his own particular idea of
economics. Mr. Morgenthau, the
agriculturist, comes along with
his. Mr. Hull would, no doubt,
take away Germany's tariffs and
customs regulations. Mr. Biddle
would destroy the cartels.
Perhaps Mr. Ickes would in-
clude in his plans the destruc-
tion of all newspapers, while
Mr. Wallace would make it a
crime to be a businessman.
Even in a stricken Europe the
collective plans of this adminis-
tration would make a fine pat-
tern of confusion.
It is not necessary to feel any
sympathy for Germany to re-
member that the world of na-
tions is interdependent. Nor is
it necessary to abate one jot
our determination to keep Ger-
many harmless to realize that
whatever is planned for Ger-
many must be adjusted to the
international needs of all those
nations which are our present
allies, friends or potential
friends.
