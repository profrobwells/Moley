Sen. Arthur H. Vandenberg
has presented to the State De
partment a still confidential
statement of his ideas about the
San Francisco conference. The
general outline of his position is
that while the immediate foun
dation beneath a world peace
organization should be the great
power of the Big Three, the ulti
mate structure should be held
together by fair and just rear-
rangement in the relations of
all nations party to the pact. In
short, power should hold the fort
while justice gets ready.
If this can become the keynote
of the San Francisco meeting, it
can be useful. But if San Fran-
cisco attempts to be a court of
justice for immediate issues, It
will disappoint everybody. The
danger of attempts to oversell
the coming conference to the
American people is very great
and very serious.
NEED FOR GROWTH
John Foster Dulles has rein-
forced Vandenberg's idea in a
speech delivered in New York
City on March 17. Mr. Dulles,
who served as Candidate Dewey's
contact with the State Depart-
ment in last year's Presidential
ampaign, said that San Fran-
visco should give the world or-
ganization "a soul so that it may
live" and a body "so that it may
grow." His practical suggestion
of a means for change and
growth is to provide for a peri-
odic review of the structure
every five or 10 years.
This idea of the need for
growth and evolution is of the
utmost importance. Overopti-
mistic internationalists and over-
pessimistic isolationists all seem
to think of peace arrangements
as perpetually frozen commit-
ments.
NEVER STATIC
But nations are never static.
Their relations with one another
are in constant flux. This proc-
ess of change can be the basis
of great future hope, if arrange-
ments made now are not too
definite and too inelastic.
It is of interest to note that
Mr. Dulles is highly regarded
not only by the Republican dele-
gates to the San Francisco con-
ference, but by the State Depart-
ment as well. When Sen. Van-
denberg was told by Secretary
Edward R. Stettinius that the
government would allow him
the services of a lawyer, the Sen-
ator said he wanted Mr. Dulles.
The request was relayed to the
White House. The fact is that
the whole delegation needs the
Dulles guiding hand. None of
the members was active in the
Paris negotiation 25 years ago,
but Dulles was there. And much
can be learned now from what
happened to that great but luck-
less design.
SPECIAL INTERESTS
San Francisco will be a vert-
table beehive of special interests.
Representatives of dozens of
little nations will be there, con-
cerned with their special na-
tional problems. The United
States can be counted on to pro-
vide its usual outpouring of
spokesmen of uplift societies-
from friends of free silver to
friends of homeless canines.
There will be a thousand who
will want, to a dozen who will
give.
And these suppliants will go
away unsatisfied, because the
conference is limited in power to
one not-too-simple jobâ€”the re-
vision of the Dumbarton Oaks
plan. It cannot settle specific
questions, but instead it will
suggest a plan to settle specific
questions.
