Arthur Vandenberg's speech
In beginning the Senate debate
on our present unsatisfactory
foreign relations was, in form
and substance, in the great tra-
dition. The Senate has not heard
Its like for many years. It is
especially helpful now because
a widespread fear exists in the
country that the history of 25
years ago will be repeated once
more.
But Arthur Vandenberg is not
a reincarnation of Henry Cabot
Lodge or of William E. Borah.
In the Lodge-Wilson rivalry a
sort of do-or-die Princeton-Har-
vard rivalry obtruded itself. It
was also Virginia and Massachu-
setts over again. Sen. Vanden-
berg is infinitely less the victim
of academic prejudice than was
Sen. Lodge and he has none of
the stubborn legalism of Sen.
Borah.
NOTABLE CONTRAST
The contrast with the League
debate of 1910 is interesting. A
search of the Congressional Rec-
ord of that year reveals many
differences. There were some
references to "the big four" and
"the lords of Paris" then. To-
day it may be "the big three."
I was unable to find any refer-
ence to "power politics" in my
recent re-examination of what
was said then. Most of the argu-
ment was concerned with the
Monroe Doctrine, with "foreign
entanglements," with the alleged
defects in the League Covenant,
with the absence of provision
for withdrawing from the
League, with complaint about
the British Empire's five votes,
with threats to our sovereignty
and with the nullification of the
power of Congress to declare
war.
LOSE THEIR MEANING
It may be that, as the debate
proceeds, some of the old slogans
will reappear.
No one is talking about sov-
ereignty now. We seem to have
our own way in this hemisphere,
and our trouble now is to ef-
fectuate the Monroe Doctrine
with no outside interference at
all. The Dumbarton Oaks plan
for a council gives no nation
undue power. And even on the
bitter question of using military
force without specific permission
of Congress, both candidates for
President and Sen. Vandenberg
as well are in agreement.
A very important point of
similarity or difference will be
whether President Roosevelt
will or will not repeat the mis-
takes of President Wilson.
REAL ELOQUENCE
Sen. Vandenberg seeks to res-
cue the Atlantic Charter from
the state of obscurity into which
the President himself, probably
inadvertently, threw it. Vanden-
berg's eloquence on this point
deserves note, not only because
of its meaning, but because of
its classic expression:
"These basic pledges cannot
now be dismissed as a mere
nautical nimbus. They march
with our armies. They sail with
our fleets. They fly with our
eagles. They sleep with our
martyred dead. The first req-
uisite of honest candor, I re-
spectfully suggest, is to relight
this torch.
"The next thing we need to
do, Mr. President, if I may be so
bold, in this spirit of honest
candor, is to appeal to our allies,
in the name of reason, frankly
to face the postwar alternatives
which are available to them, and
to us, as a means to preserve
tomorrow's peace for them and
for us."
