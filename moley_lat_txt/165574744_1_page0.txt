The incoherent pockets Into
which German resistance has re-
treated have a singular distinc-
tion. They are mostly in non-
German territory: they are al-
most entirely non-Prussian. All
the labor, conniving, blood and
iron of 130 years has been de-
stroyed in six months. All the
reforms of Stein in Prussia, all
the gains of Frederick William
IV, all the expansion directed by
the great Bismarck are gone.
The northern pocket is in part
in occupied Norway and Den-
mark; in part Schleswig-Holstein,
which was torn from Denmark
in 1864, and a small part of Prus-
sia.
The second pocket is wholly
removed from Prussia. It in-
cludes parts of Czechoslovakia
and Austria, a Hitler conquest;
part of Bavaria-never a sympa-
thetic partner of Prussia, and a
dwindling fragment of Yugo-
slavia.
The third pocket, in Italy, has
an Italian population which
hates all Germans.
LIKE WOUNDED ROBBER
Nazi Germany's situation is
like that of a wounded bank rob-
ber hiding in a courthouse.
Germany, as it stood after the
Congress of Vienna, is occupied
by the Allies. Never was there
GERMANY'S LAST STAND
a better example of the futility
of a political and military system
based on the delusion of per-
sonal or racial superiority. If
Prussia had not conceived itself
as a master nation and had rest-
ed content with what it received
after the defeat of Napoleon, Ger-
many might have been a happy,
productive and immensely in-
fluential country. The delusion
that destroyed it was a Prussian
delusionâ€”a delusion which was
finally exploited by a mad Aus-
trian. And a return to the land
of might-have-been will not be
assured by the destruction of
Nazism alone. Governments
which will repudiate the preten-
sions of Prussia as well must be
encouraged in postwar Germany.
A PATTERN FORMS
At an early date the Allies,
even though they occupy Ger-
many for a long time, must
bring into being a legal govern-
ment in Germany. The Germans
understand the meaning of legal
government, whatever may be
their barbarous conduct in the
war. What with the present
legal government assuming the
role of bandits defending them-
selves on foreign soil, the Allies
must assemble some sort of na-
tional government which, by
proclamation or otherwise, can
declare itself legitimate. That
will end the myth of rule by
broadcasts from underground
hide-outs. The sources of such
a legitimate government are be-
ginning to appear in a number of
cities and towns under the direc-
tion and supervision of the
A.M.G.
The policy of the A.M.G. is
apparently to assemble local ad-
ministrative groups composed of
Catholics or Niemoeller Prot-
estants or representatives of
non-Nazi agricultural groups or
former labor-union officials and
others.
NATIONAL GROUP
It remains to bring the best
representatives of these groups
together into some kind of na-
tional group and to seek some
form of central government amid
the ruins of the country. Early
in that process, the adoption of
the policy of keeping such a gov-
ernment from domination by
Prussians will be important be-
cause the earlier infection of
Prussianism provided a condi-
tion in which the virus of Nazism
could work its deadly purpose.
It is too early to determine
the form of such a government,
but it is clear that its general
character can be influenced by
the kind of people selected by
the Allies for national respon-
sibilities.
