Foreign Commissar Molotov
acts very much like a diplomat
who is preparing the way for a
number of major concessions on
his part by insisting upon a num.
ber of minor concessions on
ours. The issue over the votes
in the Assembly is clearly un.
important since, if we choose,
we also can have three votes,
Aside from that, the Russian
controlled votes in the Assem-
bly will be fairly numerous, for
a whole cordon of states, from
Russia to Albania, will be So-
viet-influenced and the new gov-
ernment of Finland will lean
that way, too.
ORNAMENTAL JOB
But since Britain and the
United States will have the con-
siderably more numerous votes
of such heavily influenced na-
tions, the total score will still
stand against Russia. That, cir-
cumstance was a major reason
why Russia was so insistent
upon having all real power in
the Security Council at Dumbar-
ton Oaks and the Yalta meet-
ing. And since that was done,
the discussion of Assembly votes
loses all reality.
No one can believe, what is
more, that Russia really cares
who is the chairman of the San
Francisco conference, The job
is largely ornamental. The ques-
tion on this issue is why, in the
name of the Continental Con-
gress, was this matter not set-
tled before everybody got to San
Francisco?
Russian recalcitrance may
also have another reason. The
Russians are shrewd and suspi-
cious traders. Over the years
they had acquired, in one way
or another, a fairly good esti-
mate of what President Roose-
velt might do in a given sit-
uation.
NEW PRESIDENT
Now they must deal with a
new President. They cannot
be expected to know, at this
juncture, much about his fiber
and methods. They can deter-
mine that only by putting a num-
ber of issues, fictitious and oth-
erwise, up to him.
It may well have been this
desire to see more of President
Truman's methods which caused
the Russians to frustrate the ef-
forts of the American and Brit-
ish Ambassadors in the Moscow
meetings on the Polish issue.
It is all a very irritating busi-
ness, however, and Commissar
Molotov must be aware that
Russia is losing some of its pop-
ularity in this country. This is
most unfortunate, because the
great role of Russia in the war
had, over the past three and a
half years, reduced the opposi-
tion to Russia to a mere handful
of Russia-haters. These bitter
enders are now triumphant.
They are saying, of course, that
they were right in the first
place.
PATIENCE NEEDED
On the other hand, it seems
to me that we should summon
our patience to the limit in this
situation. We must remember
that after the last war the Allies,
including the United States, all
but isolated Russia. We denied
them recognition for many
years. We were most doubtful
of their capacity to withstand
the Nazi attack, and our public
prints were full of those doubts.
The net of it all is a residue
of hurt feelings and suspicion.
So let's be as patient as we can.
There is too much to lose by a
allure in the good relations of
the two greatest powers in the
world.
