Herbert Hoover's proposed
seven additions to the Dunbar-
ton Oaks plan should be one of
the bases of the American dele-
gation's contribution at San
Francisco. Neither political dif-
ferences nor the personal an-
tagonism of the administration
to Mr. Hoover himself should
lead our delegation to ignore sug-
gestions like his.
The President assured Sen.
Vandenberg that the delegates
were to be free agents and thus
they are not bound by the stub-
born Washington policy of re-
fusing to use the great ability
and rich experience of the for-
mer President.
MUST BE EVOLUTIONARY
Two general principles domi-
nate all seven of the Hoover pro-
posals. The first is that peace
plans already prepared or to be
adopted at San Francisco should
recognize that the ultimate
building of peace should be evo-
lutionary. Plans should provide
room for change and growth.
First steps should be cautious,
but should be carefully aimed at
a long-time goal. In short, the
direction, not the length of the
step is important.
In line with this principle,
Mr. Hoover proposes a periodic
revision of treaties at intervals
of, say, 10 years.
Provision should also be made
for progressive disarmament of
the United Nations after the
complete disarmament of the
enemy has been assured. This
would presumably be a slow but
progressive process. The final
Hoover point on this score is
that peacemaking should be
slow. The chief reason for this
would be to permit the hot pas-
sions of war to die away before
the shape of the world is fixed.
SEVEN PROPOSALS
The second Hoover principle
is that we should avoid putting
too much weight on a general
world organization, at least in
the first years of its existence.
Hence, his belief in regional or-
ganizations to provide means
close to each nation to deal
with matters which are not of
world-wide concern. He would
provide regional councils in each
great area to deal with matters
affecting the nations in that area.
Asia, Europe and the Western
Hemisphere might be such re-
gions.
ORIGINAL PROPOSAL
Probably the most original of
Mr. Hoover's proposals deals
with the controversial issue of
whether our delegate on the
Security Council should be em-
powered to authorize the use of
force without the approval of
Congress.
Mr. Hoover would not give
such power to our representa-
tive, but to the President. But
he would bind the President by
a majority of the joint foreign
relations committees of the Sen-
ate and House on the question
whether the final decision should
be submitted to Congress. This,
in effect, would provide a re-
straint upon the President and,
at the same time, would make
prompt action possible in a
crisis.
Mr. Hoover's suggestions em-
body the wisdom of experience.
