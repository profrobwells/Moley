Tom Corcoran is in the news
again, and it looks as if he
would continue to be for a long
spell. It is a sort of tribute to
American freedom of opportuni
ty that Tom should, after 12
years, be a national figure. In
fact, Tom may hve in history
as a product of private initia
tive. For it is only a dozen years
since Corcoran, a young grad
uate of the Harvard Law School,
appeared in the R.F.C.
That was not his first Wash
ington experience, because in
1926-27 he had been secretary
to the late Justice Oliver Wen
dell Holmes. He really earned
that job, since the custom at
Harvard each year was to send
the venerable justice the best
of the Law School crop.
JUST REMEMBER—
Before we consider the im
mediate Corcoran situation, it
may be well to recall for a mo
ment his association then 85
years old. Tom was 27. From
what I have been able to gather,
the great jurist knew his law
so well that writing opinions
was no great task, and the
young secretaries who came
down from Harvard were ex
tensively used as young eyes
for the aged scholar. Reading
ranged far and wide.
Since an austere cynicism was
a major trait in Holmes, young
men were likely to gain the
impression that striving for so
cial progress was a pretty silly
game, that Congress and the
States should try experimental
legislation because nothing
much could hurt the United
States—in short, that reformers
were most harmless when fully
occupied. But the Holmes bark
was worse than his bite and,
beneath his pessimistic philoso
phy, was all the sturdy moral
ity, industry and patriotism that
flowed from his ancestry. It
was inevitable, however, that
young men were influenced, per
haps unduly, by Justice Holmes’
faintly skeptical quips.
It has always been clear that
Tom Corcoran had a quite
realistic outlook on life.
HIS INTEREST
It is interesting to note that
he was not a New Deal impor
tation. He joined the R.F.C. in
Hoover’s day. When the New
Deal came along he became an
ardent reformer. I knew him
well then and I could never
wholly determine what he ex
pected his reforms to do for
human beings. I sometimes felt
that he was more vigorously in
terested in what reform did to
human beings—that is, to the
human beings who were being
strait-jacketed. Whether or not
Tom considered the New Deal
as any great shakes in social
progress, however, there is no
doubt that he recognized it as
wonderful for Corcoran’s prog
ress. Ultimately, he was giving
orders to the high priests of
government.
It is to be hoped that what
ever Congress may do by way
of investigating Norman Lit
tell’s charges, a sense of philo
sophic calm and humor will be
allowed a place in the proceed
ings.
