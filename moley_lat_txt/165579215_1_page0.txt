Raymond Moley—THE BRITISH ELECTION
It is probable that the most
astonished people in England
last week were the Labor party
leaders. Some weeks ago, after
the election, the best Labor pre-
dictions were that the party
would reduce the Conservative
majority to a margin small
enough to insure another elec-
tion in a few months. Then
ominous doubts began to appear
in the Conservative press. It
was evident that the soldier vote
would be heavily anti-Conserva-
tive. But no one predicted the
sweeping Labor vote which has
now appeared.
This result follows the historic
pattern in England. Win or
lose, the British think they need
a change after a war. The cus-
tom of handing great Prime
Ministers their hats after the
empire has been saved goes
back to the older Pitt.
For the British people this
war has been the hardest of all.
It has given them no new con-
tinents or sources of revenue.
Countless thousands have been
bombed out of their homes. Food
has been monotonous.
And with Germany down, the
British feel that the war, for
them, is over. The Japanese af-
fair, to the man on a London
street, is a colonial affair. Brit-
ons haven’t much left to give,
but certainly they hate to give
it for Hong Kong.
This reaction is not a great
revolutionary swing to the left,
as our American radicals would
like to have us believe. It
wasn’t the green light for the
nationalization of basic indus-
tries or for the Beveridge plan
or for a swing to Communism.
The Communists were weak in
the vote total. The result came
from reaction from war, from
the idealistic slogans of victory
over danger, from privations
and suffering.
It remains to be seen pre-
cisely how many of its promises
the Labor party can redeem. Its
job is unbelievably hard. The
new Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer will be master of an
empty treasury. The initial
loans to be expected from the
United States will be used up on
current balances. Taxable re-
sources will be lean.
The average American quite
properly asks what this means
to us. The answer is that we’re
sorry for Churchill. He is
America’s favorite British states-
man of all time. We eagerly
look forward to the great books
which he now has the leisure to
write.
This victory for the Labor
party will have no leftist influ-
ence on our politics. American
concern is with the Japanese
war, with the terrific problems of
reconversion and with getting
on with the job of patching up
the world.
We can feel assured that a
Big Three, with Attlee in
Churchill’s place, will be more
productive of agreement, since
Stalin always distrusted Church-
ill and the Conservatives.
American opinion strongly
favors all possible financial aid
to Britain. The overwhelming
Congressional votes for Bretton
Woods, for lend-lease and for
the Import-Export Bank prove
that.
And slowly and almost imper-
ceptibly we are learning how to
pick up the lines of world lead-
ership which Britain has held
so competently for two cen-
turies. We are the firm friends
of the British people, whatever
government they choose. And
we are quite aware that they
need friends.
