The appointment of Fred Vin-
son as Loan Administrator and
of William H. Davis as Director
of Economic Stabilization is
characteristic of the White
House.
When you read of a fairly con-
servative appointment, watch
the papers. Another, not so
conservative one will come
along. Right and left-hayfoot,
strawfoot. Please everybody,
provided the generously drawn
Curzon line between the left and
right sides of the Democratic
party is observed.
VITAL FACTOR
After the threat of a Wallace
R.F.C., the Vinson appointment
offered distinct relief to those
who believe in an orthodox
administration of government
oang. Mr. Vinson has kept
within the favor of the President
over the years, but he is far
from a New Dealer in ideology.
Long service in Congress won
him the respect of his colleagues,
and in the administration of the
R.F.C. this is profoundly impor-
tant.
A fact that has never been
plainly pointed out is that the
R.F.C. is more clearly an agency
of Congress than of the admin-
istration. It is a corporation cre-
ated by Congress and endowed
with money appropriated by
Congress.
It is only nominally a subordi-
nate agency in the executive
department. But two steps
taken in the past moved it away
from Congress and placed it in
the Presidential household. The
first was the creation, in 1939,
of the job of Federal Loan Ad-
ministrator, which was filled by
Jesse Jones and which included
supervision of a collection of
government corporations and
agencies, including the R.F.C.,
generally concerned with lend-
ing.
The second step was the trans-
fer, in 1942, of this office and
this collection of agencies to the
Commerce Department. Both
these steps should have been
prevented by Congress, for they
were done in pursuance of a
bad administrative principle.
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
The recent restoration of the
lending agencies from the De-
partment of Commerce once
more gives Congress a close re-
lationship with the R.F.C. With
Mr. Vinson at its head, Congress-
men and Senators will feel at
home when they call there in
pursuit of the many items of

duty, patronage and other in-
terests dear to the people of
their district.
William H. Davis, as head of
the War Labor Board, has been
no citadel of strength. He has
conceived his job to be that of
a conciliator among the warring
interests that have come before
the W.L.B. and also among the
various people on the board it-
self.
WEAK POSITION
The internal battle reached its
height two years ago, when
Wayne Morse, now Senator
from Oregon, disagreed with Mr.
Ickes and other public repre-
sentatives on the W.L.B.
Mr. Morse resigned subsequent
to that, and Mr. Davis might
well have resigned also in light
of the weak position into which
the administration pushed the
W.L.B. at that time.
REAR-GUARD ACTION?
The Davis policy has been to
give a little here and a little
there. In carrying out the vast-
ly more important principles
to be sustained in the anti-in-
flation problems of the Office of
Economic Stabilization, Mr. Da-
vis can hardly be expected to
be an inflexible director.
The best we can hope is for a
long series of rear-guard actions
hardly appropriate to the infla-
tion onslaught which will ac-
company the last months of war.
