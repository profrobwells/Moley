The manner in which this war
will probably end should give
a big edge to conservative
rather than radical thinking in
military science.
After the last war, the public
utterances of men like Secre-
tary of War Newton D. Baker
stressed the prospective novelty
of any future war. It was said
over and over that civilization
could not endure another war.
The general use of gas was pre-
dicted. The early advocates of
air power were seeking atten-
tion by overstressing their case.
Thinking on war was in the
realms earlier described in the
romance of H. G. Wells, but
once more human imagination
had outrun human ingenuity.
Advocates of air power were
talking before this war about
how it would be over in three
days. That implied, of course,
that the Germans would be sure
to win. Yet the war has turned
out to be one of the longest in
history.
The Germans, who, because of
their preoccupation with war,
have always been strong in de-
veloping, if not in originating,
new weapons, produced the luft-
waffe and supersubmarines.
Where are these weapons now?
The Germans also put a tremen-
dous effort into V-bombs and
rockets. Untold study went into
the development of an atomic
explosive which had some of
our amateur strategists sorely
worried. But, so far as we out-
siders know, the secret of the
atom still defies human ingenu-
ity.
UNIFIED TEAM
Despite the many requiems
that have been sung over the
poor battleship, the battleship
has survived. Fleet-Adm. Ernest
J. King derides those who "sang
the swan song" of the battle-
ship and of the foot soldier. In
his recent annual report he said
of the dispute between the car-
rier and the battleship: "Air-
craft can do some things that
ships cannot do. Ships can do
some things that aircraft can-
not do. Working together, sur-
face ships, submarines and air-
craft supplement each other so
that the strength of the unified
team is greater than the sum
of the parts."
Hitler, the intuitive innova-
tor, has failed so dismally that
the orthodox military ideas that
he disregarded promise to be
stronger than ever before. He
gave his support to novel weap-
ons and unusual strategies. He
is blamed by his generals for
neglecting German railroads in
favor of the autobahnen. The
latter are now serving his ene-
mies.
The foot soldier has proved his
indispensability and, while this
war kept out of the trenches,
the old tonnage weapons, with
improvements, are winning the
war. There has been no substi-
tute for heavy artillery, the ma-
chine gun, the infantry rifle
and armored cavalry.
We are moving into a world
with many innovations, but the
outlines will remain basically
the same. We have built upon
what we had. Perhaps it will
always be so.
