The Polish
Question
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
• When governments, especially
the heads of states, deal with
each other, one of the most po-
tent arguments they use is the
state of public opinion in their
own countries. One statesman
will say to another: "I person-
ally agree with your demands,
but my public will not stand for
them. Give me a little time to
educate my people and I think
we can agree." And thus time,
which is essential in such nego-
tiations, can be gained, and the
hard-pressed statesman hopes for
something to turn up.
According to highly depend-
able American newspaper
sources in London, something
like that happened in 1942, when
Russia and Britain made their
treaty of mutual aid. Russia
wanted the Polish question set-
tled then, along the lines now de-
scribed by Mr. Churchill. The
United States asked that specific
reference to the problem be
omitted because of its probable
reaction in this country. It was
omitted.
POPS UP AGAIN
The issue arose at Tehran, and
again the public was not in-
formed, probably for the same
reason that it had not been in
1942. Now both Russia and Brit-
ain apparently feel that, with
our election over, it will be un-
necessary to wait longer, and so
the Polish cat is out of the bag.
Mr. Churchill is having plenty
of worries in his own country, of
course; but the issue has been
passed along to Mr. Roosevelt,
and no issue that he has ever
faced means so much to him and
to his country.
GREATLY COMPLICATED
It is immensely complicated by
nationalistic and religious issues
here. Americans of Polish an-
cestry and religious groups
which suspect Russia will see
this as a major victory for Stalin.
Those who wanted to avoid in-
tervention in Europe before
Pearl Harbor will say that their
claim that this is a war for power
in now proved. Suspicion of Eu-
rope will rise in the Senate and
endanger the whole structure of
peace.
Americans of all opinions, dis-
appointed and saddened by the
unexpected length of the war in
Europe, will lose some measure
of their faith that this war can
really end war. All this creates
a grave crisis of opinion in Amer-
ica, and it is going to need all the
restraint and good sense we have
to avoid disaster.
This Polish issue is not impos-
sible to solve. It may ultimately
come down to what is done to
two cities—Lwow and Vilna.
Perhaps Mr. Roosevelt realizes
that and hopes for some sort of
compromise. But his responsi-
bility to direct his efforts to that
end is inescapable.
