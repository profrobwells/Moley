The first edition of a German
language newspaper published
on Jan. 24 in Aachen carries
some incidental material on what
is involved in reconstructing a
devastated city. This paper, the
Aachener Nachricht (Aachen
News,) is apparently published
hy Germans under the super-
vision of American authorities.
Lite revives quickly, even in a
city which military dispatches
described as a heap of bomb-
blasted rubble. Under the head
of "Manufacturing Industries
Reconstruction," the following
comment appears:
RECONSTRUCTION STARTS
"The industry of the city is
energetically working toward
furthering and aiding the recon-
struction of the city. One hun-
dred and forty-two industrial
firms have already registered for
this work; 24 of them had start-
ed working; the others are busy
cleaning up the city and procur-
ing the material."
An order from the Mayor tells
everyone who intends to change
his address. to register in the
museum building, which is ap-
parently still standing. The sta-
tistical office says that during a
period of seven weeks after Dec.
1, when the tide of war was rush-
ing through the city, 12 mar-
riages, 10 births and 43 deaths
were registered. If we consider
these normal deaths by the nor-
mal death rate, this means that
30,000 civilians are in Aachen,
but the births would indicate
only half that number. The dif-
ference must mean that those re-
maining in the city are mostly
older people.
VACANT APARTMENTS
A list of vacant apartments
has been drawn up and is made
available at the new official
"apartment office." This office
makes it possible for bombed-out
families to use the space and fur-
niture of evacuated families.
The venerable cathedral, once
the burial place of Charlemagne,
is open for worship. Half of the
Catholic churches are also used
for regular services. The other
Catholic churches are conduct-
ing services temporarily in near-
by buildings.
The American courts are pass-
ing judgments in accordance
with German law, with a careful
elimination of all aspects of that
law which derive from Nazi in-
fluence. For example, an um-
brella manufacturer and his wife
were sentenced to nine months'
imprisonment under German law
for hoarding food.
HOSPITALS RUNNING
Practically all the Aachen hos-
pitals are operating, with a total
of 19 doctors and auxillary per-
sonnel.
The American authorities have
removed the names of six streets
which were changed under Nazi
rule. Hermann Goering Strasse
and Horst Wessel Strasse have
their old names again. Schla-
getel All√©e, named after a Nazi
killed in 1923, is now named after
Friedrich Ebert, the first Presi-
dent of the German republic.
The overall impression de-
rived from current reports from
correspondents on the scene is
that life is moving back in old
channels and that reconstruction
is proceeding at a good pace.
Germans now in exile here say
that the old city of Charlemagne
can be fully reconstructed. The
American authorities seem to be
following a course of common
sense with which the delivered
Germans are co-operating. In re-
construction in Europe, the first
essential ingredient is at hand,
skilled workmen. There will also
remain much of the materials
for building. Aachen is only a
part of Germany, but the
may well apply else-
