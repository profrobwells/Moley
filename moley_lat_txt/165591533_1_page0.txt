The transfer to the Commerce
Department of the business of
handling surplus goods hitherto
handled by the Treasury pro
vides that zealous experimenter,
Henry A. Wallace, with some
thing besides figures for his
genius. There are various esti
mates of the amount of goods
which are thus placed at the
mercy of Mr. Wallace's sales
force.
FRIGHTENING TOTAL
A year ago Dr. A. D. H. Kap
lan of the Committee for Eco-
nomic Development estimated
that about $15,000,000,000 worth
of stuff would be available for
civilian use as soon as the last
shot is fired. Some economists
have put the figure as high as
$25,000,000,000 or even $30,000,-
000,000. In any event, this prop
erty is a very sizable cloud hang-
ing over manufacturers of and
dealers in textiles, shoes, drugs
and trucks. It is also a matter
of serious concern to all work
ers in industries producing such
articles. For nothing can so
quickly kill a job as a surplus
of the goods produced by that
job.
The conservative Dr. Kaplan
estimated that the supplies of
textiles, clothing and shoes not
used by the armed forces would
be about $4,000,000,000. Trucks,
jeeps and other motor vehicles
would be $3,000,000,000, while
foodstuffs and a variety of other
raw materials would reach
$1,500,000,000.
For some business lines these
surpluses are frightening, in
deed. In the textile and ap-
parel field $4,000,000,000 worth is
more than all the wholesalers
in the country have in their
warehouses not only of textiles
and clothing, but of all commod
ities of every kind.
MUCH ABROAD
War Mobilizer James F.
Byrnes explained at the begin-
ning of this year that large
amounts of foodstuffs will have
to be retransported to America.
Dr. Kaplan estimated that one-
half of all supplies are abroad.
It has been asserted that the
way to dispose of surpluses is to
sell them abroad. If this is half
of what we have, it will mean
$7,500,000,000 worth, which is
more than twice our exports in
our last peacetime year.
THE QUESTION
If this is done, Mr. Wallace
will have some embarrassing
times, for he appeared before a
Senate committee last week and
clashed with Sen. Alexander
SURPLUS GOODS
Wiley over his views on foreign
trade. Mr. Wallace, it should be
remembered, is the man who
said in February that we should
treble our foreign trade and thus
provide 3,000,000 jobs. Where
will those jobs be, if the stuff to
be exported is already made and
if much of it is already abroad?
When a supposedly money-
hungry Treasury held these sur-
plus goods, there was fear that
they would be sold. Some
months ago Mayor LaGuardia
came forth with a proposal to
dump the surplus in the sea.
A HOT POTATO?
Perhaps now that Mr. Wallace
is in charge he will heed the
LaGuardia advice. His previous
experience with surpluses was
with farm products. To avoid
the threat of such goods hang-
ing over the market, he plowed
under a part of current produc-
tion.
In the case of manufactured
goods, that method would also
plow under the very jobs he has
promised. That would be a
strange plight for a man with
Presidential aspirations. But
what Mr. Wallace intends to do
is a dark secret. Perhaps he
has not made up his mind. Per-
haps the new President has
handed him a very hot potato.
