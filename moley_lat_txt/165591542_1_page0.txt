It may be ungracious to look
for jokers in the code of "Prac-
tical Partnership" issued by
Eric Johnston of the United
States Chamber of Commerce,
William Green of the A. F. of L.
and Philip Murray of the C.I.O.
But one item suggests that
there is still something to he
settled between labor and man-
agement before harps and wings
are in order. The fourth article
of the "code" contains this sen-
tence:
"The fundamental rights of
labor to organize and to engage
in collective bargaining with
management should be recog-
nized and preserved, free from
legislative enactments which
would interfere with or discour-
age these objectives."
UNFAIR WAGNER ACT
Does this mean that the three
men pledge their respective
bodies or that they pledge them-
selves to support no changes in
the Wagner Labor Relations
Act? It is quite possible that
Mr. Murray would so interpret
this statement.
The Wagner Act is palpably
unfair to management. It is only
half what a fair act should be.
It does not give management
access to a quasi court which is
supported by all taxpayers and
which compels the obedience of
all Americans.
If this proposition supports
the freezing of all so-called la-
bor enactments without any con-
sideration of the right to post-
war reconsideration or revision,
it cannot claim the interest of
fair-minded Americans.
FINE PRINCIPLES
Beyond this, the principles
indorsed by Messrs. Johnston,
Green and Murray are admi-
rable. Article I is an assurance
to labor of a policy of joint
efforts to sustain wages at a
level which will assure an in-
creasingly higher standard of
living. This, by inference, we
must attain not by assigning to
labor a larger relative share of
industrial Income, but from "im-
proved productive efficiency and
technological advancement."
Management gets some recog-
nition in Article 3: "The inher-
ent right and responsibility of
management to direct the op-
erations of an enterprise shall
he recognized and preserved so
that Industry may develop and
expand and earn a reasonable
profit. Management must be free
as well from unnecessary gov-
ernmental interference or bur-
densome restrictions."
CAREFULLY WORDED
The section on foreign trade
is so carefully worded that both
high and low tariff people can
sleep peacefully therein. Tariffs
are not mentioned, and opposi-
tion to "unreasonable and arbi-
trary" restraints of trade per-
mit a wide latitude of inter-
pretation. On this matter of the
tariff it is probable that the la-
bor signatories of the code are
more sensitive than is Mr.
Johnston. In the postwar era,
labor is likely to be much more
protection-minded than is man-
agement.
The suggestion in this Joint
statement of a national commit-
tee of representatives of busi-
ness and of labor organizations
is all to the good.
WHAT IS NEEDED
It is hight time that, in a coun-
try that boasts of a free econ-
omy, labor and business create
their own committees. Joint
committees sponsored by the
President and the Secretary of
Commerce' have, over the past
few years, been little more than
A JOKER IN THE CODE?
stooges for a government which
is far from being always truly
impartial.
And now, with a Secretary of
Commerce selected against the
wishes of management and with
the support of labor, govern-
ment sponsorship of free econ-
omy committees would be ridicu-
lous. Let's have committees of
management and labor which
are sponsored by management
and labor,
