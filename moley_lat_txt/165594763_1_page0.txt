Yugoslavia, itself a federation
of Slavic peoples, is working
hard to achieve a larger feder
ation of Slavic states, extending
from the Adriatic to Turkey.
Russian influence may be
brought to bear in favor of this
plan, if, in fact, it is not already
the motivating force behind it.
Russia's interest in such a fed-
eration lies not only in its tradi-
tional Pan-Slavic policies, but in
its desire to establish its position
in a great new Mediterranean
balance of power.
Britain is concerned. There
has been no official statement of
the British position, but it is
clear that there would be great
fear there lest such a federation
might press heavily on Greece-
a vital link in Mediterranean
politics.
The Mediterranean world,
since the building of the Suez
Canal, has witnessed the passing
of two successive rivals of Brit-
ish domination. For a long time
it was Turkey, with at least a
theoretical empire in North
Africa and Asia Minor and with
the control of the Dardanelles.
Slowly the power of the "sick
man of Europe" ebbed and, with
the end of the first World War,
Turkey retained little but the
Dardanelles.
Then Italy had her little day.
Mussolini claimed the whole
Mediterranean, "mare nostrum,"
among his miscellaneous illegit-
DARDANELLES TO GIBRALTAR
imate offspring. Now all that
passes, with Britain still power-
ful, with France and Spain little
more than onlookers and with
Russia determined to realize the
old desire of Peter the Great for
a window on the Mediterranean.
Modern Russia, however, has
a Mediterranean concern beyond
that of Peter. She now claims
membership in the international
group controlling Tangier. That
strange international zone, which
looks north upon the Strait of
Gibraltar, has been governed by
Britain, France, Spain, Italy and
the Sultan of Morocco. Russia's
claim to participation is a sign
of a new factor in the western
gate of the Mediterranean.
No doubt, the memory of
Stalin goes back to the bitter
end of his "volunteers" in the
civil war in Spain. He will also
not forget the role of the "blue"
division, sent by Franco to fight
with Hitler. Stalin's position is
that Fascism will not be exter-
minated in Europe so long as
vestiges remain in Spain, and
that, with a share of the Medi-
terranean, he will be in a posi-
tion to finish the job by diplo-
matic pressure. Also, he will be
able to make sure that Russia's
exit through Gibraltar will not
be barred by a hostile Spain.
Russia's demands upon Turkey
for free use of the Dardanelles
can hardly be denied. Turkey
deserves little consideration
after its greedy opportunism in
the war. The Arab world is not
unsympathetic to Russia. And
the reality of Britain's life line
can be maintained, even after
Russia moves into second place
in the waters between the three
continents. This will be a major
question at Potsdam, which will
require sympathy and media-
tion by the United States.
