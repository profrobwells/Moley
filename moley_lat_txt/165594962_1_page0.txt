It's strange that John L. Lewis
did not think of royalty pay-
ments on coal in the first place.
Mr. Petrillo beat him to the roy-
alty idea and made it a part of
his settlement. But Mr. Lewis
now has the Petrillo precedent
to go on and can be counted on
to make the most of it.
The Lewis proposal is a roy-
alty tax of 10 cents on each ton
of coal mined. This tax, for it
is a tax, is to be paid by the oper-
ators to the United Mine Work-
ers. It is thus a private tax
which would become operative
either upon acquiescence by the
operators or by order of the gov-
ernment.
'EXPLANATION' MADE
The text of the union's de-
mand, which is unique in the
long history of the miners'
struggle with the operators, sets
forth the following explanation:
"Such royalty shall be deemed
partial compensation in equity
to the mineworker for the es-
tablishment and maintenance of
his ready-to-serve status, so vital
to the profit motive of the em-
ployer and so imperatively es-
sential to public welfare.
"Funds resultant from accrued
royalties will be available to
the union to provide for its mem-
bers modern medical and sur-
gical service, hospitalization, in-
surance, rehabilitation, and eco-
nomic protection."
INFLATION MENTIONED
Mr. Lewis, in his customary
fulsome way, asserts that this
demand is in conformity with
the government's purpose to re-
strain inflation. He said:
"The revenue would not be
available to purchase goods and
chattels. It would be used for
investment and insurance, which
are considered to be noninfla-
tionary. It does not increase
values. It does not lower the
purchasing value of the dollar.
PRIVATE TAXATION
It does make a contribution to
economic stability. It expresses
those dreams and those hopes
which lie close to the heart of
every coal miner and his wife."
CURIOUS COMBINATION
It is thus an investment by
the public in the bodily health
and productive capacity of the
miners.
In principle, this royalty busi-
ness is a curious combination of
extreme individualism and of
collectivism. It is not a govern-
ment grant. The government
does not touch the money or
directly authorize its collection.
It is a taxation for a private
purpose, but it is taxation of pri-
vate property by private indi-
viduals for the benefit of a
wholly nongovernmental unitâ€”
the union. Its distribution and
use is not by the miners, but
the union.
SOFT SPOT FOUND
In Petrillo's case, it was final-
ly agreed to by the companies
after Mr. Petrillo had refused to
obey the W.L.B. or to appear
before it and had also refused
to heed the President's request.
The whole procedure is a sort of
private collectivism, with the
government looking on with
mingled amazement and skep-
tical sympathy.
It shows, however, how dan-
gerous it is when government
permits a precedent such as that
established by Petrillo. This
method of strengthening unions
can be applied to almost any
commodity produced by union
labor. The sums collected can
be very large, since the method
is similar to a sales tax. And
the control of the funds under
present law gives neither gov-
ernment nor the workers them-
selves anything like adequate
control. Once more John L.
Lewis has found a soft spot in
the government's leaking wage
ceiling.
