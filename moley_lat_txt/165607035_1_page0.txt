A group of leading German
Communists in Russian-occupied
Berlin have issued a manifesto
which not only denies any inten-
tion of Sovietizing Germany, but
favors forms of political and
economic life closely resembling
those of the western powers.
That this was done with the
hearly approval of the Russian
government is obvious. The
manifesto was given wide prom-
inence in the Moscow press.
The German Communist party
in its statement declares that
conditions in Germany do not
favor a Soviet system and that
"the real interests of the German
people require a democratic par-
liamentary republic with all
democratic liberties."
SHARP CONTRAST
No program of confiscation of
property is suggested, beyond
the taking over of the big es-
tates of the Nazis, the Junkers
and other imperialists. Beyond
this, the manifesto advocates
private enterprise on the basis
of private ownership. The lead-
ing signer of this declaration is
Wilhelm Pleck, whose adherence
to Communism goes back to the
days of Lenin. He was an asso-
ciate of Rosa Luxemburg in the
abortive revolution after the
first World War and during the
republican regime was a Reichs-
tag Deputy. Since then he has
regularly visited Moscow and
was always a faithful adherent
of the Comintern.
The contrast between the pol-
icy of the present German Com-
munists and that of the Com-
munists in Germany after 1919
is sharp. The Communist party
then precipitated bloody fighting.
This time, it takes another
course.
SOME REASONS
One of the reasons for the
present policy is, no doubt, to
reassure anti-Russians in all
countries, including the United
States, about Soviet intentions.
It is a denial of the charge that
Stalin intends to communize
Europe. It is a declaration that
Russia wants friendly, but not
Communist, governments as
neighbors.
Another reason is economic.
The Russians realize that any
sweeping proposals to Sovietize
German farms would paralyze
food production. The memory
of what happened in the earlier
days of the Russian revolution
is still fresh. The communiza-
GERMAN COMMUNISTS
tion of land resulted in such
sabotage and confusion in farm-
ing that starvation and death
ensued. The food problem in
Germany will be serious enough
next winter without additional
troubles.
ONLY SMALL GROUP
The problem of large estates is
not serious in what will remain
of the Reich, in any case. Most
of the big Junker estates are east
of the Oder and will fall within
the new borders of Poland. A
further economic reason behind
the Communist policy is that
Russia wants to maintain Ger-
man industrial production so
that the Germans can work on
reparations. German industries
will need credits and other ap-
pendages of capitalism, if they
are to produce the goods re-
quired by the victorious nations.
This is no time for experiments,
and the Russians are practical
enough to realize it.
German Communism was
never strong. It never had more
than 12 or 18 per cent of the
vote. Hitler exaggerated its
power to advance his cause. The
attempted domination of Ger-
many by such a minority would
do little but introduce confusion
and end in failure.
