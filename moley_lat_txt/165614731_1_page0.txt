The pathetic struggles of the
O.P.A. over the fixing of prices
on forthcoming new automo
biles suggest how much easier
it is to get government into pri-
vate business than to get it out.
The car-pricing example illus-
trates the pains that are ahead
in months to come with many
other kinds of business.
It has been announced that
the ceiling has been fixed for
Willys-Overland Jeeps. But these
cars have been in war produc-
tion, and the revised model is
new to the civilian market.
THE PROCEDURE
The O.P.A. has approached the
task of fixing the prices on mod-
els discontinued during the war
with the boldness and confi-
dence of a wren trying to steal
food from a kingfisher. Ques-
tionnaires went out on which
manufacturers of parts labored
for periods as long as six weeks.
Conference dates with the large
manufacturers were set and
then postponed. A meeting in
Washington was held, and the
manufacturers found that the
O.P.A. experts were able to
speak only in generalities.
Then "task forces" of Wash-
ington functionaries appeared in
Detroit and sat down with man-
ufacturers' accountants. These
labors went on and on. Now
WHAT PRICE AUTOMOBILES?
the "task forces" have returned
to their base in Washington.
The reasons for the difficulties
in fixing prices on the new cars
are not hard to see. Some pro-
ducers of the many parts which
go into automobiles have gone
into other lines of manufactur-
ing. Other manufacturers of
parts don't know whether they
will make the same products
again. All their basic elements
of cost have changedâ€”wages,
transportation and materials.
In most cases, manufacturers,
both of finished cars and of
parts, must move into civilian
production gradually. War con-
tracts involve profits. Civilian
production will involve initial
losses. The job of balancing war
profits and civilian losses in a
given year is practically an im-
possible one, since the rate of
transition is not uniform as
among companies and can hard-
ly be predicted.
SOME PROBLEMS
If the O.P.A. sets prices ap-
plicable to the industry as a
whole, weaker companies will
be badly squeezed. If each com-
pany is dealt with separately,
the public will be subsidizing
the weak ones. If ceilings are
set by models, some manufac-
turers point out that nothing
will be the same but the name.
One manufacturer was asked if
he would accept the 1942 price
on Model X. "What Model X?"
he answered. "We will not be
making that model again. There
will be a hundred changes."
If the O.P.A. sets prices on
finished cars and lets parts
prices go natural, the car manu-
facturers, who are fierce com-
petitors and tough buyers, will
hold prices down themselves.
Such a policy might work in the
automobile industry, but it prob-
ably would not work in many
others.
PRECEDENTS TO BE SET
If the government should de-
cide that automobile price-fixing
is too hard to work out and de-
cides on no controls, there will
be demands for similar treat-
ment by hundreds of other in-
dustries. Finally, if delay and
hesitation are the rule, civilians
will be denied their needs, and
unemployment will pile up.
This complex situation faced
by the O.P.A. is only one side
of a larger situation with many,
many more sides. Precedents
set here will apply to hundreds
of other articles. And no one
knows better than the O.P.A.
how difficult it is to set prece-
dents and to hold them. When
we bring government into busi-
ness, we weave a tangled web.
