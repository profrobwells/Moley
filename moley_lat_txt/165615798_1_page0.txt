In the midst of resounding
news from Asia and the Pacific,
little attention has been given
to the War Crimes Committee
report issued in London and to
Justice Robert II. Jackson's
statement explaining it. But this
report makes history of great
significance. Justice Jackson
and his British, Russian and
French colleagues have done a
remarkanie jou in a short time.
New principles and new law
have been created which ought
to live for all time.
To appreciate the significance
of the War Crimes Committee
report we must understand that
despite big talk all through the
war about punishing war crim-
inals, no practical means ex-
isted to carry out that talk.
There was no international
court, no law, and no procedure
to try war criminals, except
those who were guilty under the
specific jurisdiction of individual
countries. Efforts after the last
war to bring evildoers to jus-
tice ended in a fiasco. A whole
system of justice had to be built
from the bottom.
These were serious difficulties.
International dealing with the
chief officers of an offending and
defeated state had never been
done on a real judicial basis.
These difficulties have been
A NEW CRIMINAL COURT
overcome by a simple document
issued on the authority of the
United States, Great Britain,
Russia and France. It first sets
up a court—called an interna-
tional military tribunal—with
four judges, one for each nation
concerned. Its jurisdiction is
limited to the trial and punish-
ment of major war criminals of
the European Axis.
It then sets up a brief code of
criminal law, describing in very
general terms the offenses that
shall be regarded as criminal.
Then it sets up a simple code or
procedure, unfettered by the
complicated provisions now in
the laws of all nations. Finally
it tells what punishments may
be prescribed and how judg-
ments shall be carried out.
Justice Jackson, in this state-
ment, makes the point that a
fairly satisfactory agreement
has been made between the Con-
tinental theory, in which enor-
mous latitude is permitted for
all manner of evidence, and the
Anglo-Saxon restrictions on evi-
dence. Also, agreement between
the theories of the presumption-
of-guilt and the presumption-of-
innocence has been made. In
general, the new system leans
to the Continental side, and this
Justice Jackson justifies by
pointing out that the German
and Italian accused have them-
selves lived under the Conti-
nental system. Justice Jackson
also says that we must be
patient, since the trials may
take considerable time. He says
that these must not be regarded
as political trials. The accused
persons are just ordinary male-
factors to be treated as such.
And finally, Jackson asserts that
the German people must realize
that these people “are not on
trial because they lost the war,
but because they started it.”
