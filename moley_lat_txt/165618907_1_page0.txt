Raymond Moley._ CONTROL WITHOUT NATIONALIZATION
The faith of the British Labor
party in the old principles of
Fabian Socialism is shown in
the proposal of the British occu-
pation forces to "nationalize" the
coal operations in the Ruhr. The
old Fabians, including the
Wehhs, George Bernard Shaw,
H. G. Wells. and others, had a
magic formula for all the world's
ills. If anything went wrong na-
tionalization could cure it. And
so we find the British Socialist
government proposing the na-
tionalization of coal as a cure
for war.
The basic formula in the cur-
rent proposal is to create a sort
of Ruhr Valley Authority. (Here
the British Socialists take a leaf
from the New Deal book.) This
authority would be supervised
by the occupying powers, with
minority representation from
Holland, Belgium and little Lux-
embourg. The French, who want
the Ruhr themselves, would,
nevertheless, accept, such a plan
as second choice.
It is plausibly argued that,
as long as the occupying powers
are, in fact, the government of
Germany, this plan would pro-
vide control of one of the de-
cisive pillars of a possible arma-
ment Industry.
However, to nationalize coal
will not check German means
to arm. Coal and iron are so
closely related economically that
their control has, in fact, for a
long time been interrelated into
a combined iron and coal works.
This combination, in turn, has
been interwoven with the elec-
tric industry. Coal is not the
only source of power, and sci-
ence may find still newer ones.
But as has been pointed out
ever since Socialism became pop-
ular in England, nationalization
cannot stop with a single indus-
try. One industry depends on
another, and so the process of
nationalization, once started,
goes on and on.
It is now fairly generally rec-
ognized that the Potsdam plans
for reparations and control are
inefficient and clumsy. Manufac-
turing equipment removed now
can be replaced. Occupation is
not the lasting answer, since
its utmost limits will be under
10 years.
German industry, in whole or
in part, need not be nationalized.
Private enterprise should be per-
mitted to a degree. But there
might and should be created a
"German Manufacturing Author-
ity," which would be a partner,
not the sole owner, of every in-
dustrial enterprise employing
more than a few employees. This
authority, controlled by the pres-
ent occupying nations and such
others as are directly interested,
should have full power of in-
spection, of membership on
boards of directors and some
sort of veto on activities which
might breed war. Reparations
might be handled through shares
of profits coming through such
a partnership. Sufficient control
could be exercised over a long
period, while within industry it-
self there could be room for pri-
vate capital and management
to operate. This form of control
would thus avoid the dead hand
of nationalization, keep a watch
over rearmament and offer Ger-
man initiative a chance to re-
build legitimate prosperity.
