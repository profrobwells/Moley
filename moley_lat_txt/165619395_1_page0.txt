Raymond Moley- WHY NOT SELL MORE SURPLUS GOODS?
One of the most astonishing
figures in the President's budget
was his low estimate of receipts
from the sale of surplus prop-
erty. The figure for the fiscal
year 1946-47 was $2,000,000,000.
Scheduled surplus property re-
ceints for the years 1945-47 were
probably less than $8,000,000,000.
This is conservatism with a ven-
geance.
The contrast between this
modest estimate of sales and the
figures of stuff available for sale
is striking. The Surplus Prop-
erty Administration says that by
June, 1947, property worth $52,-
000,000,000 which was produced
for war will be declared surplus.
SALES ABROAD
Almost half this will be
abroad, and $28,400,000,000 will
be here. This includes $11,100,
000,000 in plants and industrial
real property, $5,700,000,000 in
production materials and plant
equipment and $4,800,000,000 in
consumer goods. It apparently
does not include surplus ships,
the value of which is declared
by the S.P.A. to be $15,000,000,000.
Ships are to be sold at 50 per
cent of prewar cost, except for
Liberty ships, which are to bring
31% per cent.
The conservative estimate of
what is to be realized on this
property in the near future is
based on the fact that, both here
and abroad, a considerable
amount of spoilage has taken
place in goods which might go
to consumers. Also, that plants
are not likely to go like hotcakes.
It is reported in Kansas City,
however, that surplus plants are
meeting a brisk demand. The re-
gional director there is getting
excellent prices for five-year
leases.
The S.P.A. reports proudly
that one-fourth of its food sur-
pluses has been sold and that
it actually brought a profit of 6
per cent over cost. This shows,
of course, that there is an active
demand and that the public
would probably have taken the
remaining three-quarters, had it
been available.
SLOW TO APPEAR
Surplus consumer goods are
exceedingly slow in appearing in
the retail markets. We do not
know exactly what is covered
by the $4,800,000,000 of "con-
sumer goods." It is a lot of stuff,
however, since we do know that
the value of retail sales in the
United States is about $6,000,-
000,000 a month. It is quite fair
to say that, if the government
could market, say, $1,000,000,000
a month more, many of our pres-
ent embarrassing scarcities
would be relieved.
One of the major complaints
which is heard around the coun-
try is the slowness with which
the vehicles, on which veterans
are given a priority, are com-
ing out. Jeeps and trucks and
cars are only trickling into the
hands of eager buyers, and many
of the vehicles are in a deplor-
able state of efficiency.
OFFERS IN FRANCE
We hear from France that
the offers of surplus goods there
are beyond the reach of French
buyers. And we hear, too, that
there is considerable black mar-
ket in Germany in some mill-
tary equipment.
Since the general picture of
the budget fo. 1946-47 comes so
close to balance, it is deplorable
that the government is so back-
ward and so pessimistic about
its sale of surplus goods. For un-
less all the S.P.A. figures are
wrong, there is ample stuff to
provide the magic four or five
billions needed to put Uncle Sam
in the black.
