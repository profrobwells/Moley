William H. Davis, Director of
Economic Stabilization, seems to
have a casualty-of-war psychol-
ogy. His proposal that the gov-
ernment shape its economic pol-
cies to permit a large wage in-
crease over five years, without
increasing the cost of living, as-
sumes that war controls are to
remain for that period. It is the
O.P.A. forever with him.
But no one in his right mind
believes that Congress will agree
to continue that agency beyond
next June. Or that the assorted
labor agencies of the government
can, even with their present
powers, stand rigid against the
forces of supply and demand.
The Davis broadside must be
regarded, therefore, as part of
the political campaign now go-
ing on to provide a big alibi in
1046 against the consequences of
considerable unemployment. Mr.
Wallace's talk of 60,000,000 jobs
is another side of the same cam-
paign.
In order to establish his prop-
osition that wages can be in-
creased without raising the cost
of living, Mr. Davis uses for
comparison the years 1919 and
1944. He says that wages in
1944 were 47 per cent higher
than in the earlier year, but that
the cost of living was virtually
the same. The year 1919, of
course, was most abnormal. The
public invented the alphabetical
H.C.L. to describe the greatest
problem of the year. Commodity
prices broke in 1920, and living
costs went down.
The proposition that wages can
be increased 40 per cent in five
years without an increase in
prices, moreover, is intended to
mean that the standard of living
of Americans can be increased at
the rate of 8 per cent a year.
This never has been done. In
the 10 years from 1919 to 1929,
the total annual consumption,
plus investment, increased only
about 2.7 per cent a year. Al-
lowing for an increase in popula-
tion, this means that Americans
had only about 2.5 per cent more
per year per person in 1929 than
in 1919. Yet that was a time of
great prosperity.
If, as Mr. Davis seems to as-
sume, Congress should continue
the O.P.A. beyond next June,
wage increases would be allowed
only after the O.P.A. had deter-
mined whether the increases
were to be absorbed. This means
that profits would be rigidly reg-
ulated over a period of five
years. It means, besides, that
the sources available for taxes
will be compressed still further.
It goes without saying that
wage increases of the amount
suggested are quite possible in
some highly efficient industries
and in certain industries in
which labor costs are propor-
tionately small. But in several
industries wage rates will deter-
mine, with great accuracy, the
amount of production in pros-
pect. This is especially notable
in housing. Present wage scales
are already a depressing factor
in this, the greatest of postwar
prospects for expansion. In-
creases of the size suggested
would cut the prospects of build-
ing to a tremendous degree. No
prospective builder can be com-
pelled to invest in a house. Nor
can a contractor be compelled to
undertake the job. The Davis
proposal is one of the most cer-
tain ways to prevent the realiza-
tion of the rosy picture of em-
ployment painted by Mr. Wal-
lace. There are no jobs in houses
which are never built.
Nor will there be jobs in for-
eign trade if American costs are
raised at a moment when other
nations are vigorously seeking
new markets and are willing to
produce on wage scales lower
than ours.
