Americans seem to take it for
granted that England will go
radical after the war. Such an
assumption needs to be severely
qualified. If there is a recession
in the strength of the Conserva-
tive party, as may be proved by
the recent election, what party
will inherit the lost strength?
What sort of radicalism will be
stronger? Will it be a trend to-
ward Communism or toward
something quite England and
unite foreign to Communism?
We don't, of course, know yet
how the election came out. The
highest estimate ventured by
the Conservatives is that they
lost 50 of their 150 majority.
The best that Labor hopes is
that the Conservatives lost 135 of
their majority. Conservative
papers during the past few days
have expressed grave doubt
about Churchill's winning a se-
cure working majority.
Everyone, however, agrees
that there was considerable
apathy and dissatisfaction with
both the major parties. It was
not a pretty election campaign.
Nobody believed the Churchill
charges that the Labor crowd
was a tool of Moscow. And
neither did anybody believe
that the Conservatives were
enemies of the needy and poor.
There was a lot of buncombe in
both appeals.
The Conservatives had certain
initial advantages: They threw
the election into the middle of
a war and then claimed that
their leaders and only their
leaders were suited to deal with
Stalin and Truman. They
sounded like the people a year
ago over here, people who said
that only Roosevelt could deal
with Stalin and Churchill. But
that sort of talk won votes in
both countries.
The Conservatives had a fur-
ther advantage. In 300 constitu-
encies Liberal party candidates
ate heavily into the Labor vote.
Minor groups, called the "splin-
ter" parties, also took their toll
from Labor candidates.
The final result may possibly
be an inconclusive test of
whether England is going left
or right.
The real test of how commu-
nistic Britons have become will
be the relative strength of the
Communist and Commonwealth
parties. The Commonwealth
crowd advocates a type of radi-
calism which is peculiarly Brit-
ish. Unlike Communism, it has
a heavily ethical strain in its
philosophy. Its leading mem-
bers are middle class, and its in-
tellectual head is a baronet. The
party is about as Marxian as
were our Populists 50 or 60
years ago.
If, as seems likely, this small
party polls twice as many votes
as the Communists, we shall
have further evidence that Com-
munism is making no progress
in England. There is plenty of
discontent and plenty of desire
for a change. But England will
not go to Moscow for salvation
