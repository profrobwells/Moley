Prof. Harold J. Laski, the loud
voice of the British Labor party,
is sending chills down Conserva-
tive backs here and in his own
country by talking about na-
tionalizing the Bank of England.
But it is quite certain that more
practical minds in the Labor
party realize that the voters ex-
pect that the first order of busi-
ness will be to do something
about the coal mines. Chilly
houses cannot be warmed by
the old lady in Threadneedle
St.
To do something about coal
mining is going to be a laborious
and prosaic job wholly unsuited
to the rhetorical talents of Mr.
Laski. But no other issue in
the recent campaign so stirred
the feelings of voters. The coal
miners voted for higher wages.
Coal users voted for cheaper and
more abundant coal. Since these
objectives look in opposite di-
rections, it seems as if some-
one is going to be disappointed.
British mines are very old,
yet they are still rich. But their
equipment is antiquated and
their methods of operation are
notoriously inefficient. German
mines were poorer, but German
equipment was vastly better,
The price of coal in Britain rose
during the war almost 100 per
cent. Wages in the mines rose
120 per cent and other costs 73
per cent. But these increases
failed to enlarge production. In-
stead, there was less production.
The government provided
large subsidies, but coal prices
continued to rise. And private
capital hesitated to enter the in-
dustry because of the threat of
nationalization.
If nationalization is tried, what
will be the pattern? Probably
the government will give own-
ers long-term bonds at a low
appraisal. These bonds will be
added to an already heavy na-
tional debt. The bonds can be
paid off only if nationalization
means large economies in pro-
duction. These economies, to be
effective, must be reflected in
the price of coal for export or
in the price of other articles of
export in whose production coal
is involved.
Improved machinery, if se-
cured through government ex-
penditures or through loans
from Uncle Sam, will displace
workers, and the government
will have to shift these workers
to other industries. The govern-
ment may meet spirited oppos-
tion from such displaced work-
ers and, in order to overcome
such objections, the government
will surely have to dig into the
Treasury for workers' benefits
and the like. This again in-
creases the tax burden on indus-
tries not nationalized and which
must get costs down, if Britain's
foreign trade is to be boosted
50 per cent.
Whichever way the Labor
government turns, it will have
to meet the old economic riddle.
Foreign trade can be increased
if export prices can be reduced.
But state socialism, with large
domestic expenditures for work-
ers' benefits, increases the price
of exports. The short cuts out of
this dilemma are subsidies
through foreign borrowing or
currency devaluation. And any
currency devaluation by Britain
during the 18 months before
Bretton Woods goes into effect
would meet stiff objections or
outright counterpressure from
the United States. Britain, un-
der any government, will hes-
itate to risk that.
The world revolution of which
Mr. Laski speaks so glibly will
have trouble getting under way,
even in Mr. Laski's own coun-
try.
