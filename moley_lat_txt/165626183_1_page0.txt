President Truman will have
lots of trouble keeping hands
off in the General Motors strike,
The magnitude of this struggle,
the resources and the extreme
commitments on both sides point
to a national situation of such
gravity that only the Federal
government will be capable of
dealing with it, not to say of
settling it. Sooner or later, Mr.
Truman and his associates will
be deep in the picture and all
political calculations for the next
year will be affected by what
results.
As this column has pointed out
repeatedly, an effort to differentiate
among industries as to the
amount of wage increases to be
favored will lead to a jungle of
tangled relationships. Modern
industry is so interrelated and
General Motors is so big that
what happens will affect national
industry as a whole. Moreover,
the General Motors market is
so broad that vast numbers of
the population will feel price increases.
And the people thus affected
will include almost all
farmers and white-collar workers—not too sympathetic to the
demands of a rich union like the
U.A.W. The administration will
be dealing with economic and political
principles which may affect
American life for years to
come.
What is more, an effort to generalize
wage increases will draw
attention to a basic flaw in the
U.A.W. demand. The high average
of employment in manufacturing
industries was not 48
hours. It was 45.6 hours in December,
1944, according to the
Manpower Commission statistics.
It was 44 hours last July. This
means that a cut to 40 hours
would involve much less than a
30 per cent cut in wages. It
should also be kept in mind,
when comparisons of living costs
are involved, that in 1938 the
average weekly employment in
representative industries was
34.3 hours and in 1939 it was
37.6 hours.
The pity of the administration’s
position is that, while it
is well aware of the political circumstances
recited above, it
seems to have no fixed position
on the more significant economic
problems involved. But that
is the way with all pure political
thinking, and this administration
is probably the most politically
minded in history. Political
thinking deals with the shadows
of things, not things. It
deals with the complex and confused
public thinking about situations,
not with the situations
themselves.
Mr. Truman cannot solve this
union labor crisis by any political
yardstick. It involves economic
facts and economic statesmanship.
To illustrate this, it
should be pointed out that the
essence of the U.A.W.’s demand
that production costs be given to
the public will inevitably tend to
break down competition in the
greatest of competitive industries.
Such a pooling of information
as would be involved would
force mergers—in short, force a
cartelization of automobile production
through the force of a
union which encompasses all the
bigger companies and their subsidiaries.
This single fact is one
of the many which the President
must face. And it cannot be
examined through a political
telescope.
