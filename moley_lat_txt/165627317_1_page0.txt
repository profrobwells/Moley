The names of the Germans to
be tried by the new internation
al criminal court include few
surprises. It was not generally
expected that Rudolf Hess would
be included, because there was
whispering of a British inclina-
tion to omit him; hut Russia ap-
parently insisted that he be in-
cluded. Also unexpected is the
name of Krupp von Bohlen und
Halbach, industrialist. Also, two
of the generals, two admirals
and Schacht and von Papen.
Arranged by categories, these
defendants include:
Eleven former members of
Hitler's Cabinet—among them
the terrorists, Streicher and Ley;
Two top generals and two ad-
mirals;
Two "spiritual" leaders—Ros-
enberg and Hans Fritzsche;
Four Gauleiters or Governors,
including Baron von Neurath;
Two other Nazi stooges;
The head of the Krupp works;
And Goering.
The gallows seems certain for
Streicher and Ley. Also for
Frank, infamous Governor of Po-
land; Seyss-Inquart, Reich Com-
missioner for the Netherlands;
and von Neurath, oppressor of
Czechoslovakia. The court may
provide dramatic hangings for
these men at the scene of their
former authority.
Von Ribbentrop and von
Papen will claim diplomatic im-
munity and, no doubt, will cite
the precedents of Talleyrand and
Bethmann-Hollweg.
The two generals, the two ad-
mirals and Albert Speer, head of
the Todt construction organiza-
tion, will make a defense on the
ground that they were profes-
sionals, subject to the authority
of the political heads of the state.
Herr Krupp will argue that
he did no more than any indus-
trialists must do. Dr. Walther
Funk, Minister of Economics
and president of the Reichsbank,
will deny his part in warfare
or in political persecutions.
But the greatest of interest
will center in the immensely
clever Hjalmar Horace Greeley
Schacht. This American-born
financier has had many friends
in British and American banking
circles. He may offer some as
character witnesses.
Finally, there is the nerve-
racked Goering, who can do lit-
tle more than to turn state's
evidence to buy a flitting span of
life.
It is well that the new court
can create its own tests of guilt,
even though such a process is
contrary to Anglo-American tra-
ditions of justice. The Nazi con-
spiracy was without precedent.
It was the most cynical denial of
precedent that the world has
known. Hence, the conscience
of men everywhere, except in
Germany, can hardly be af-
fronted if this group is denied
the right to appeal to past his-
tory. The court before which the
trials are to be held is unique.
Its procedure is unique. Its pun-
ishments will be unusual. But
this is an unusual case.
