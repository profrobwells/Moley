After the first impact of the
news of the atomic bomb, two
questions have occurred to most
people. Is there enough mate-
rial to make a considerable num-
ber of the bombs? Can the
principle behind the atomic
bomb take its place in the non-
military world in the near fu-
ture?
For obvious reasons the gov-
ernments concerned are not an-
swering the first question. But
people familiar with the long
history of prewar experimenta-
tion on the subject are certain
that we have enough of the es-
sential materials to continue un-
believable attacks on Japan from
here on.
The postwar possibilities of
the new source of power are still
speculative. Carbon will be with
us for a long time doing our
heavy work. There is no imme-
diate occasion to grow panicky
about the future of the universe.
But no one can brush aside
the ominous lesson that we must
learn from the bombing of
Hiroshima. Those who refused
to heed the fact that this has
been a changing world from the
dawn of time must take note of
this sharp reminder from the
material world. The military
INTELLIGENCE OR CHAOS
Importance of this new weapon,
as well as collateral weapons
already known, is that war has
become a luxury too expensive
for the world's budget. That
this is generally realized is
clearly shown in the countless
times that observation has been
made since the atomic bomb
fell.
The danger is that we shall
accept that tremendous fact and
then proceed as if past habits
or loose thought in political and
economic affairs would suffice
for the future. It will not be
enough, for example, to assume
that the United Nations charter
will solve things, or that mere
acceptance of our position as a
world power will suffice.
If the scientists had been will-
ing to accept a few formulae as
a substitute for a completed
fact, Hiroshima would still be
intact. The general ideas be-
Fishworms
Cincinnati Enquirer
"The Department of Agricul-
ture has issued a bulletin on
how to make a noise like a fish-
worm." This bulletin was paid
for, of course, by another variety
of worm, the lowly American
taxpayer.
hind this discovery were the
common property of the world
before 1939. But the necessity
of war drove the intelligence of
many men and women to the
labor of seeking practical means
of filling up the outlines.
Some such intelligence and
unremitting labor will be re-
quired in the political and eco-
nomic world if the natural
forces we have discovered are
not to outrun our capacity to
master them. No ordinary or
commonplace people were at
work in the laboratories which
saw this discovery. Had the
carelessness we have shown in
selecting people to run our gov-
ernments been applied to this
massive force, it would have
killed more Americans and Brit-
ish than Japs.
We can no longer select men
to make great decisions as Am-
bassadors and Foreign Ministers
on the basis of considerations
wholly unrelated to the work
they are to do. We cannot do
it, to a degree never known before.
To a degree never known before,
detailed knowledge, extraordi-
nary intelligence and devoted
labor must go into government
and economic affairs.
This is a lesson that the first
atomic bomb must teach us.
