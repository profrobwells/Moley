Isolationism in the United
States, if it returns, as it did
in 1920, will not come from
those over here who preach it
every day. It will result from
the mounting frustration of
those who are dealing directly
with the occupation and from
what we hear and shall hear
of growing difficulties in Eu-
rope.
It is now reported that re-
searches by our military intel-
ligence reveal that the Germans
do not like us; that they like
us less than the French, Rus-
sians and British. And that some
of the clerics in Germany are
suspicious of our actions and
intentions.
This news, taken by itself, is
not startling. The German ob-
session for years to come will
be that they were denied vic-
tory by the United States. After
the other war, they hated Wood-
row Wilson more than other
Allied leaders, because he tossed
the decisive sword into the bal-
ance. It is hard to believe that
our military-intelligence investi-
gators appraised German feeling
in the Russian zone, for it is
not clear how they could operate
there. It is equally hard to be-
lieve that Germans prefer Rus-
sians or French to Americans.
But nonetheless, the situation
is not improving. Essential coal
is not being produced, because
Germans in sufficient number
and with suitable physical ca-
pacities are not available for the
hard work of mining. Germany
formerly used husky Polish min-
ers who were attracted by good
pay. Now Poles are not forth-
coming for that work. The Rus-
sians are using them. Transpor-
tation is still wrecked. Food is
scarce. A dire winter is setting
in.
Our frustration is increased
by difficulties over Germany's
neighbors. They suffered from
Nazi highhandedness before and
during the war, but over the
years they have had many ties
with the Reich, and these sur-
vive.
Early this year, when Ger-
man defeat seemed certain, the
Swiss gave what seemed to be
a guarantee not to allow Ger-
man capital to ship in or out of
Switzerland. But the fact is that
in the present year the Nazis
could buy some gold in Switzer-
land. Now that the Allies are
masters of Germany, they are
seeking to expropriate German
property abroad. Until last week
the Swiss seemed unwilling to
deliver anything to the Allies
that is not openly marked as
the property of the German gov-
ernment. The Swiss banks ap-
parently cling to the tradition
of a "banker's secret," and will
act only when advised by those
who deposited money.
Denmark is not too strict with
collaborators or with the thou-
sands of Nazi refugees in that
country. Dr. Best, Hitler's for-
mer personal representative, was
recently reported to be living
pleasantly in Copenhagen.
Early Dutch demands for a
mile of Germany for every mile
of flooded Holland have not been
reiterated. The Dutch are thrifty
and they are anticipating a
restoration of former trade re-
lations with their big neighbor.
In the slow return of Europe
to normal conditions, these at-
titudes of Germany's neighbors
will grow more friendly. And our
occupation will grow more diffi-
cult to maintain.
