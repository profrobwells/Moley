Reassurance in the Budget
Raymond Moley, Journalist and
professor of public law, an early
member of the New Deal, brain
trust is a noted analyst of domes-
tic and international affairs. His
associate in this article, Julius
Hirsch, is a prominent economist
of New York and senior consultant
of the Office of Price Administra-
tion.
The facts revealed in the budg-
et message for 1946 will be re-
assuring to the American people.
They will strengthen their con-
fidence that our economy is bas-
ically sound and that our dollar
can remain sound.
The budget message tells the
world that we have already dis-
continued increasing our na-
tional debt. We are even on the
way to reducing it, although only
on the balance sheet. This will
greatly strengthen our financial
reputation abroad.
WORLD'S SANTA CLAUS
While we are looked upon as
a sort of Santa Claus all over the
world, recent visitors from
abroad have expressed the con-
viction that a reduction in the
value of our dollar will come.
They had read, day by day, in
our newspapers and in their
own, that huge deficit spending
would raise our national debt to
astronomic figures and that the
rise would continue.
Now the message states that
no further increase in our debt
will be necessary for years to
come, be it by additional borrow-
ing from the commercial banks
or from the Federal Reserve
System. This is, in itself, a
great political asset for America.
Our situation can be even bet-
ter if we can exact the utmost
receipts from surplus goods and
plants.
One year ago we were alarmed
by rumors that $50,000,000,000
worth or more of surplus goods
were going to flood the markets.
Business was relieved when an

excellent study, done for the
Committee for Economic Devel-
opment by A. D. H. Kaplan, said,
evidently on the basis of official
data, that only $15,000,000,000
worth of such goods would be
immediately available; of these,
there would be $3,000,000,000 to
$4,000,000,000 worth of textiles,
clothing and equipage and
$3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000
worth of motor vehicles, parts
and accessories.
But, according to the budget
message, only $2,000,000,000 are
expected from the sales of sur-
plus goods in the fiscal year 1947.
Thus, the Truman budget esti-
mate seems to have cut the ex-
pected receipts from surplus
sales to less than half of that
estimated by the Kaplan study,
at least with reference to the
current and the next fiscal year.
And that leaves us with the
question: Where are the brand-
new plants and equipment for
which Uncle Sam paid $16,000,-
000,000? Are the receipts from
their sale included in the $9,000,-
000,000?
NOW IS TIME TO SELL
If there ever was an opportune
time to sell these goods which
are left over from the war, it is
now. Today they are an asset;
later they will be a liability.
Doubt begins with the em-
phasis laid in the message on the
assertion that the budget of the
years after 1947 "can hardly be
expected to be reduced to less
than $25,000,000,000." This would
mean, if the States and local
communities continue to spend
$8,000,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 a
year, that all combined must
constantly raise $33,000,000,000
to $34,000,000,000 a year. This is
"only" about 20 per cent of the
huge wartime national income;
but it would be 45 per cent of
our dollar income of 1939 and 75
per cent of that of 1933.
It has become an almost gen-
erally accepted theory that the
income of government cannot
exceed substantially 25 per cent
of the national income. There-
fore, the national income, as
anticipated by the budget mes-
sage, may be around $132,000,-
000,000 to $136,000,000,000.
WHAT GUARANTEE?
But, provided we can keep
the value of the dollar stable, is
there any guarantee that such
an enormously high national in-
come will be sustained? If we
want to have a balanced budget
in the future, built on solid
ground, we must, despite the
warning of the budget message,
try to find substantial savings
in the projected expenditures.
After all, there is a great dif-
ference between a government
expenditure of less than $9,000,-
000,000 before the war and the
expected $25,000,000,000 of a
"normal" postwar budget.
It must be admitted that a
good deal of increase is inevi-
table. Four billion more for the
interest of the national debt and
$2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000
more for veterans and similar
aftermath expenditures will be
needed.
IT'S UP TO CONGRESS
Taken all together, the budget
message is reassuring. Less re-
assuring is the fact that some
of its underlying ideas are based
on the hope of an unparalleled
expansion.
To build on such hopes a per-
manent $25,000,000,000 budget
would be a hazardous gamble.
Congress must eventually be
more realistic. If it can bring
the overoptimistic planning of
the administration back to earth,
it will make real the reassuring
facts of the budget message and
a more solid basis for balanced
budgets in our future.
