Democratic politicians in
Washington regard local elec-
tions in New York and else-
where as a ringing national vic-
tory. But such an interpretation
may prove to be a dangerous
inducement to overconfidence.
For the results, in general, were
marked by apathy and confu-
sion, rather than a national
It can be successfully argued,
however, that the election
showed a great deal of machine
vitality in northern cities. Bos-
ton took back its prodigal son,
Jim Curley. Cleveland elected a
Democratic Mayor by a big mar-
gin. Pittsburgh took David Law-
rence, State Democratic chair-
man. Mayor Frank Hague's
candidates did not do well in
Jersey, but Mr. Hague himself
received a big vote of confidence
in May. Machine regularity was
the order of the day.
It was rumored that national
Democratic headquarters was
sympathetic to Richard T.
Frankensteen's run in Detroit.
But even that failed to elect him.
The sum total of the results
means, if it means anything,
that voters have emerged so re-
cently from war psychology that
they are not interested in politi-
cal decisions. At such a moment
regularity prevails.
Such a state of mind will pass
within a few months, and dis-
crimination and interest will
come back. By next year politi-
cal thinking may well show dif-
ferent tendencies and for that
reason President Truman and
his party may well avoid over-
confidence now.
