The Labor Party's Budget â€” BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When the Labor Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Sir Hugh Dal-
ton, presented his annual budget
to the House of Commons, the
London stock market went up
like a balloon. For months there
had been fears of a great capital
levy and that there would be
rich gifts for the low-income
groups. It was further expected
that there would be plenty of
deficit spending and socialization
projects.
But none of those fears were
realized, and the capitalists were
agreeably surprised. Perhaps,
they are now saying, the Labor
party is once more going ortho-
dox in finance. The Labor party
under Ramsay MacDonald had
an exceedingly orthodox Chan-
cellor, Philip Snowden.
It is a little early to celebrate,
however. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer says that his favor-
able picture can be realized only
if the American loan goes
through. Only that sum will
bridge the gap between British
purchasing power and earnings
through exports.
One point on which Sir Hugh
follows the Labor party line is
the estate tax. On an estate of
$8,000,000 or more, the heirs
must pay three-quarters to the
government.
The deficit of Britain for the
last year was $8,400,000,000. But
the total budget for next year is
$15,500,000,000, with a deficit of
$2,800,000,000, which is probably
more than we shall have. Sir
Hugh promises a balance two
years hence. Sir Hugh makes
the dry remark that Britain is
"paying reparations to Ger-
many." $300,000,000 is marked
for German occupation and feed-
ing.
The low-income groups will pay
a lower tax because of the in-
crease in personal exemptions.
But there is no indication of a
full return to the old habit of
exempting all who earn less
than $750. All other incomes
pay "9 shilling of the pound,"
which means 45 per cent. During
the war the rate was 50 per cent.
Some sales taxes will be reduced
in proportions varying from 33
to 100 per cent.
The entire impression given by
the Chancellor is that his budget
and the speech accompanying it
were aimed at America. Sir
Hugh bears the reputation of being
one of Britain's most intelli-
gent labor leaders. He is trying
to say to our Congress that the
Labor government does not intend
to equalize income and assets
artificially, roughly and mechanically. He is saying that a
balanced budget and sound
financing are his objectives. For
this reason he wants us to know
that, if a loan is made, Britain
will live up to her obligations
under it. This will, under the
Dalton plan, be quite possible,
for the first payment under the
proposed loan will not be due
until 1950.
The net of the Labor government's gesture to us is that, if
we make the loan, Britain will
conduct her finances on traditional lines.
