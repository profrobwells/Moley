We have had no residential
building since 1942. A great deal
of normal construction has been
lacking for four years. This, in
itself, would cause a tremendous
housing shortage.
In addition, the rate of mar
riages, as well as of births, has
gone up sharply. Three and a
half to four million G.I. families
are already looking for shelter
and, for the most part, unsuc
cessfully. In addition, better in-
comes are causing families to
seek the expansion of their liv-
ing quarters.
DOUBLING UP
It is cold comfort for the O.P.A.
to declare that "for the next few
years 4,000,000 families will have
to double up." Since there are
35,000,000 families and house
holds in the United States, this
means that every ninth family
must double up.
That is, they will double up
if something is not done about
it. But in the face of this dire
need, the American people will
certainly do something about it.
We are not the sort of people
who must wait for government
to think something up. For a
century and a half Americans
sheltered themselves through
private enterprise. We have
not lost the habit of building
homes.
TO BE TORN DOWN
The planless government plan-
ners have made no provision for
this situation, in any event.
Moreover, our war-housing legis-
lation contains an ingenious stip-
ulation that war-emergency
housing is to be torn down
within two years of the end of
the war.
This stipulation originated in
the belief of those who drafted
and passed the legislation that,
after the war, labor and mate-
rials would be abundantly avail-
able for good residential con-
struction and that flimsy, make-
shift houses would, in the na-
ture of things, be empty,
NOT AVAILABLE
Our housing wizards have
forecast that in 1946 some 400,-
000 to 450,000 dwellings will be
built. It was recently reported
that Mobilization Director Snyder
and his assistant, Robert
Nathan, are working feverishly
to get 100,000 units ready next
year. It seems clear to almost
everyone that material for any-
thing like 400,000 dwellings will
not be available.
But Mr. Snyder predicts that
we shall have from five to seven
million unemployed by April
and possibly 8,000,000 by au-
tumn. This reservoir of labor,
with what material is available,
should be adequate for provid-
ing temporary housing over the
next two or three years. For
we clearly must not only retain
the temporary houses we have,
but we must put into effect
sweeping plans for still more
temporary shelters.
PRINCIPLES SUGGESTED
The principles which should
govern this emergency job
should be these:
1—For greatly congested areas
there should be large construc-
tion of trailers and the organ-
ized moving of Army barracks.
2—Temporary housing, built
with what materials we have,
should, as far as possible, be
built on permanent foundations,
since there is more foundation
material than lumber.
3—In large cities vast areas of
roof space are unused. Here is
space for additional upper floors
and penthouses. Metals, in-
cluding aluminum, and plywood
would provide very satisfactory
materials for such additions.
OFFERING RELIEF
4—Single residences in rural
and small towns and suburbs
can, with great economy of ma-
terial, be enlarged into double
houses.
5—The construction of ready-
made parts should be started on
a large scale almost immediately.
This might be introduced as an
activity of city governments,
without serious strain on their
budgets, since such parts could
be sold to eager buyers.
Such suggestions as these are
the product of imaginative
Americans. They offer employ-
ment, economy of material and
definite relief for a need which
is bound to be serious for two
or three years.
