The Murray-Green objections
to the Truman fact-finding and
cooling-off plan are quite under-
standable. Union labor wants
its road to government to con-
tinue as a one-way street. De-
spite their assorted differences,
Messrs. Green and Murray are
united on a policy of getting as
much from government as pos-
sible, but of avoiding any re-
straints by government. That is
the principle of the Wagner Act
and most other national labor
legislation.
Their emotion rises also from
a genuine fear of that course of
action which government may
take when all other measures
fail â€” compulsory arbitration.
Life must go on in a nation, and
the ultimate power is govern-
ment. The President is the
head of that government.
A HEAVY LOAD
Those who have seen the
Presidency at close hand all tes-
tify to the lonely sense of re-
sponsibility which hovers over
the White House. A President
lives with an awe-inspiring
sense of ultimate power. He
rises with it in the morning and
goes to sleep with it at night.
He can see anyone and ask ad-
vice of everyone. But finally he
alone must decide. Even a weak
President comes to realize this.
In seeking office, Presidents
count prospective votes and
angle for all sorts of minorities.
They create obligations and later
try to pay for them. They
know, most of them, that rough-
ly half the people want to put
them out of office and will try
to do so at the first opportunity.
But the force of circumstance
compels a President to realize
that he is really the servant of
all the people. He cannot act
merely as the agent of a part of
the people, because he can never
be quite sure which part of the
people is his support.
When, as in the present in-
stance, it becomes crystal clear
that the vital interests of the
whole country are being endan-
gered by the failure of two pow-
erful minorities to agree, he
must, regardless of conse-
quences, stand against those mi-
norities and serve a general in-
terest. And he must be the
single judge of what he shall do.
At an ultimate moment all his
advisers and subordinates are
silent, The Great White Father
must decide.
WHAT IT MEANS
Mr. Truman has made a de-
cision of that sort now. Assum-
ing that Congress agrees, he has
pushed the power of government
deep into the field of private
initiative and decision. If an-
other step must follow, he will
be the one to decide what that
step shall be.
The current decision is, in ef-
fect, that a great industry, de-
spite lively commercial competi-
tion within itself, is a single
sphere of essential production.
It has been made a single sphere
of production because union la-
bor within that sphere is a
single, united body. With such
power as is possessed by the
C.I.O., the A.F.L., or the United
Mine Workers, the issue of an
industrial strike has got out of
private hands, and the govern-
ment of all the people must
move in.
That is the essence of the Tru-
man decision, and it may well
be the end of an epoch.
