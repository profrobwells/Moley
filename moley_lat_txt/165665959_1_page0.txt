Diogenes From Dallas.
Chairman Hatton W. Sumners
of the House Judiciary Commit
tee has announced that his re-
tirement will take place at the
end of this term, after 34 years'
service. The loss to the House
will be amply compensated, how-
ever, by the advice which this
philosopher will, unfettered by
routine after his retirement,
give to the country. For he is
our foremost advocate of local
and personal responsibility in
government.
Some years ago, at the re-
quest of the President, it was
my duty to consult Hatton
Sumners about some adminis-
tration bills concerning Fed-
eral crimes, including racketeer-
ing. The bills were hastily
drawn and, in effect, proposed
dangerous extensions of Federal
power. The President, who was
then running Congress over the
White House telephone, had
told Mr. Sumners that he wanted
them passed. The sturdy Con-
gressman from Dallas was no
man to suffer executive direc-
tion. He told the President in
his quiet way that the Judiciary
Committee and the House would
use their own judgment about
the bills. He was clearly angry
about it. The bills were ex-
amined, sorted over, and the
less harmful ones passed. The
rest were killed, President or no
President.
On that occasion, as in many
instances since, Mr. Sumners
delivered himself of his views
on government power, local self-
government and individual re-
sponsibility.
Mr. Sumners, who has pru-
dently laid aside a property
basis for independence in years
ahead, will give his efforts to
hammering home to his fellow
countrymen a number of salty
and sound truths. He has deep-
ly deplored the trend toward
Federal help for this or that,
over the last 13 years. It has, he
says, encouraged people to be-
lieve that Washington can do
everything, provide everything
and never reckon the cost.
But it isn't the cost alone
which disturbs the Dallas Di-
ogenes, as he was once called.
It is the sinister drug which is
thus administered to local com-
munities and States and persons.
When the pride and self-reliance
of local communities are weak-
ened, Mr. Sumners says, the na-
tion's strength is gone. When
Washington cares for the poor
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
and unfortunate, the community
grows callous and cold. When
Federal law pursues criminals
everywhere, local law enforce-
ment becomes a lazy onlooker.
This passionate belief of Mr.
Sumners is in his speeches,
linked with a reverential bow to
the Deity. His close association
with the Lord is always clear,
and the Lord is a Jeffersonian.
"In God's economy," he once
said, "there is no attempt to pro-
tect people against difficulties.
In fact, He creates difficulties.
The difficulties which we ob-
serve in operating a free system
of government constitute the
gymnastic paraphernalia pro-
vided by God Almighty."
And in Mr. Sumners' interpre-
tation of American history, the
founding fathers were finding
fathers. Those who made the
Constitution were successful be-
cause their guide was nature and
experience. They merely looked
to eternal laws and then gave
those laws a local habitation and
a name.
Hatton Sumners, the crusader
for eternal verities, will have a
wider audience than the House
of Representatives he is leaving.
For he tells a story that people
are waiting to hear.
