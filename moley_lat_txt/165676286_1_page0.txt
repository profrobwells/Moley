One of the dark spots in the
booming 1920's was the farmer's
sinking share in the national in-
come. Years of brimming em-
ployment and large industrial
profits did not prosper the farm-
er. He worked more and more
for less and less. When the
great depression came this trend
was accentuated. Cash income
from farm products, which was
$11,300,000,000 in 1929, went
down to $4,700,000,000 in 1932.
The farmer felt like the nation's
stepchild. He developed a fierce
antipathy toward the Republican
party, and Mr. Roosevelt capital-
ized his discontent with im-
mense success.
Roosevelt's farm program
promised to give the farmer
"parity" prices. This meant
that the purchasing power of a
bushel of wheat or a pound of
cotton, measured in industrial or
agricultural products needed for
the farm or farmer, should be
the same as for the average of
1909-1913. That period, called
"normal" by the farmer, was,
in the eyes of some observers,
a golden period.
The formula devised to estab-
lish parity prices was embodied
in the A.A.A. legislation, revised
_ THE FARMER'S INCOME
after its destruction by the Su-
preme Court. But despite the
processing tax and its soil ero-
sion payments and other premi-
ums the New Deal never
achieved more than 70 per cent
of parity up to 1939. Measured
in dollars, the farmer's income
in 1939 was one-third lower than
it had been in 1929.
The war changed all this. The
farmers' cash income fluctuates
from year to year, but in 1945 it
will be about $22,000,000,000,
which is almost 4½ times as
high as in 1932. Even if produc-
tion expenses are deducted a net
farm operator income of at least
$15,000,000,000 to $16,000,000,000
must result, which compares
with a net farm income of less
than $2,000,000,000 in 1932.
Parity was not only reached
but exceeded during the war.
A price guarantee has been
extended to two years after the
end of the war. For this period
a parity of 90 per cent has been
established for most farm pro-
duction. Supported prices com-
prise two-thirds of the whole pro-
duction. Economists believe
that in a year or two, however,
prices may drop by 30 per cent
to 40 per cent—supported ones
less; nonsupported ones more.
The Agriculture Department an-
ticipates a 15 per cent drop in
farm income next year. The re-
covery of Europe and the in-
crease in production in other
parts of the world will certainly
bring about a serious change in
the farm market. However, even
in 1946, the farmers will get a
very favorable share of the na-
tional income.
The danger now is in a polit-
ical treatment of the question.
Farm-bloc Congressmen and Sen-
ators are trying to avoid even
this relatively unimportant
drop in 1946. The Pace bill
would completely overhaul the
parity formula and drive prices
up. The Secretary of Agricul-
ture has denounced this extreme
proposition.
The bright spot in the picture
is the possibility of reducing
costs of production through
mechanization and increased
efficiency. These natural meth-
ods of maintaining the farmer's
good position are what should
be depended on, and not arti-
ficial legislative stimulants.
Every reasonable American,
therefore, should support the
policy of Secretary Anderson.
