As the die is cast for a union
of Western Europe, the Paris
conference must get down to
specifications,
The greatest needs come first,
and the most urgent of these
is coal. Before the war, three-
quarters of the coal used in Eu-
rope came from the United King-
dom and from Germany. Now,
since most of Germany's coal is
in the British zone, the whole
problem is Britain's. The first
questions we want answered by
Europe are: What can Western
Europe do to increase rapidly
and before winter a supply of
European coal? What can the
United States do to help? In
1918-1922, Europe accomplished
a miracle in the recovery of coal
production. Can this be re-
peated?
Food comes next. The need
is greatest in Germany and Aus-
tria. In most of the other coun-
tries it is not so much a question
of food production as of distribu-
tion and stabilized finances.
France has always fed herself,
but now the peasant prefers to
feed his cattle rather than to
sell his food to city people. Sim-
ilar situations appear in Italy,
Southern Germany and Austria.
Europe must tell us how we can
help stabilize their currency and
-THE INDISPENSABLE ITEMS
distribute their food. Peasants
want money for their products,
not paper substitutes for money.
Transportation comes next.
All kinds of European transpor-
tation are slow and irregular.
Most Americans wonder at this,
because they fail to realize the
extent to which Europeans are
dependent on inland waterways.
A third of German coal was nor-
mally transported over rivers
and canals which are usable only
eight months in the year. The
barges formerly used for haul-
ing coal have been taken away.
Seagoing craft have been de-
stroyed or removed. Here is
dire need.
Fourth on the list is fertilizer.
One ton of synthetic nitrogen,
properly used, produces 20 tons
of grain or 100 tons of potatoes.
The problem thus comes down
to rebuilding German factories
in which fertilizer can be pro-
duced from German air and Ger-
man coal. Meanwhile, the Unit-
ed States may be called on for
immediate supplies.
The need for iron and steel
under the new European align-
ment will probably result in the
scrapping of the so-called "level
of industry plan." It may also
result in the scrapping of the
Potsdam plan for holding down
German production of iron and
steel to one-third of prewar pro-
duction. Control of armament
production will probably have to
be accomplished by some other
means. But Europe will most
certainly claim from us a large
proportion of the metal prod-
ucts necessary to rebuild the
industry.
Seven years after the first
World War, all European na-
tions, except the Soviet Union,
created the so-called steel cartel
system. The Paris conference
may seek a similar plan. Here
American prejudices against
cartels may interpose objections.
It is possible that out of Paris
may come long-term proposals
for a Western Europe customs
union. A small beginning al-
ready exists in agreements
among France, Holland, Bel-
gium and Luxembourg. The
break with Russia may hasten
the grand economic alliance
which has been the dream of
many statesmen, businessmen
and economists.
The creation of order and of
ultimate self-sufficiency may
well come from this Paris meet-
ing. Urgent need, a prospect
of generous help and the final
breaking of the Soviet spell may
accomplish what has never been
possible before.
