Henry at Armageddon
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The first and most practical
political question raised by Hen-
ry Wallace's third-party candi-
dacy is numerical. How many
votes can he get, and how many
of these will be taken from Tru-
man?
A second and more pointed
question is geographical. Where
will these Wallace votes be cast?
Polls of all sorts will soon be
pouring out, but they cannot be
conclusive for a long time to
come. The fuli Wallace strength
is not visible and audible now,
because support of his candidacy
at this time is most unpopular,
The average Wallaceite, con-
fronted with the question of sup-
port, is likely to give either an
equivocal answer or a renuncia-
tion of his former support. Only
in the secrecy of the voting booth
will he come clean,
The reason for this hesitation
about public support of Wallace
is that Wallace. has taken a
course which will subject him
and his followers to severe and
at times unjust criticism. True,
many of his followers will be
scheming enemies even of the
things Wallace wants. His camp
will be the dwelling place of Com-
munists and other subversive
people. And the presence of
these people there will make sin-
cere critics of our foreign policy
hesitate about openly acknowl-
edging Wallace sympathy.
It is clear that. Wallace's
chance of upsetting Truman is in
cutting the Democratic vote in a
few States like New York, Cali-
fornia, Illinois, Ohio and Wash-
ington, Last summer, Robert
Kenny, the Wallace leader in
California, told me of a poll he
had taken among California
registered Democrats. His fig-
ures gave Truman 60 per cent;
Wallace 40. These figures can
hardly apply to the present situa-
tion, for they were cast on the
assumption that Wallace would
run as a Democrat against Tru-
man in the primary. Breaking
from the party is another matter.
But if Wallace can take 10 per
cent of California's vote from
Truman, a Republican can proba-
bly carry the State.
In New York, Wallace's only
chance rests with Rep. Marcan-
tonio's American Labor party.
That party can scarcely hope to
poll anything like its former
vote. Perhaps 100,000 is the
limit of what can be expected.
Wallace may well be deluded
by the large attendance at his
meetings, by his mail and by the
memory of his past strength.
Father Coughlin suffered from a
similar delusion in 1936, when he
put Rep. William Lemke in the
race. There was brave talk of
9,000,000 votes for the Coughlin
candidate, but when the returns
were in, Lemke had only 891,858,
or 2 per cent of the votes. And
the Lemke votes were cast in
about a third of the States.
Coughlin's popularity never re-
covered from this shock.
