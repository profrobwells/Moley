Internal Soviet Troubles BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Fresh evidence of friction in
Soviet Russia appears in news
of the troubles of one Prof. Eu-
gen Varga. He has been re-
moved from his position as chief
economic adviser to Stalin and
to the Soviet government.
The bureau of which he was
head, the Institute for World
Economics, has been merged
with the National Economic In-
stitute. All this because of the
views expressed in Varga's re-
cent book, "Changes in the Capi-
talist Economy as a Result of
World War II."
From time to time, over four
years, this column has had oc-
casion to mention Prof. Varga.
That has been because, while
he is not well known in this
country, his utterances were an
excellent indicator of Soviet pol-
icy. It could be assumed that
whatever he said had the stamp
of official approval.
Four years ago, for example,
he was the first to set forth the
Russian specifications for repa-
rations-in kind and manpower.
The Varga figure is still the in-
flexible demand of Molotov,
His occasional articles or
speeches which reached this
country showed that he careful-
ly scanned American economic
affairs through American publi-
cations. The very fact that his
first slip from orthodoxy has
brought about his downfall in-
dicates the importance which
his views and his institute had
in shaping Soviet policy. Varga,
now more than 70, is a deeply
convinced Communist. Of all
Soviet economists he is the
greatest authority on non-Soviet
countries.
His chief sin now is that he
denies the firmly held and vig-
orously exploited Soviet asser-
tion that a capitalist depression
is imminent and that the United
States will be the point from
which a general crash will ema-
nate.
Varga does not look for a big
depression before 1955. He flatly
denies that profit hunger of the
capitalist monopolists is respon-
sible for the foreign policies of
the western powers. He says
that democratic and socialist
governments in the western
countries have for the time be-
ing mastered their major dif-
ficulties.
In Europe, he says, the capi-
talist system has had no profit
from the war. The major coun-
tries there have given up or lost
much of their empires, and the
free development of those over-
seas areas is more important to
Western Europe than the loss
of the trade of the Soviet satel-
lites.
Hence, Varga concludes that
it is wrong to believe a clash
between the Soviet Union and
the western countries is essen-
tial to the preservation of capi-
talism. Quite the contrary is
true, he says. There needs to
be economic collaboration be-
tween the western powers and
the Soviet Union in the years
immediately ahead, and this
would be fruitful for all.
Thus, he contradicts the of-
ficial Soviet dogma that Russia
and its satellites must develop
in isolation because of the dan-
ger of a capitalist collapse fol-
lowed by capitalist aggression.
This heresy brought Varga be-
fore the party court. It is inter-
esting that 20 Soviet economists
chose to follow the venerated
Varga and risk all consequences
by agreement with him.
It is important for Americans
to note that, while Varga has
lost his influence in the Soviet
machine, he retains his great
reputation and his influence on
thinking in nonofficial circles.
It is, moreover, important to
note that Molotov represents the
more extreme view of nonco-op-
eration, which Varga has of-
fended and opposed.
And, most important, the cour-
age of Varga may have been
strengthened by his belief that
Stalin and the more moderate
official elements may be more in
line with the Varga thesis than
this summary demotion may
suggest. The issue of impor-
tance to us is whether, in the
internal struggle, the Varga
point of view may ultimately
prevail.
