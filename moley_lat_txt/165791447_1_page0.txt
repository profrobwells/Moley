Two Parties in Texas BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Political changes slowly but
Inevitably follow economic de-
velopments. This is clearly
shown in what is happening in
Texas.
The State is in the midst of a
far-reaching political transition.
Nominally, it is a Democratic
stronghold. Those who are elect-
ed to national, State and local
offices are the choice of Demo-
cratic conventions and pri-
maries. But in political, social
and economic affairs, Texans
run the entire spectrum of opin-
ion. Elected to office, they sup-
port measures that range from
immovable conservatism to the
pink center of New Dealism.
They vote the same ticket, but
they feud and fight.
It is idle to believe that this
situation can last, although it
may be some years before two
genuinely rival parties will ap-
pear. A change must come be-
cause almost all the factors
which made a one-party system
have vanished from Texas.
There is no fear of Negro power
in politics, as there is in other
Southern States. Texas agricul-
ture is not dominated by a sin-
gle crop. Nor is agriculture all-
important, because a vast indus-
trial development is already
present. Texas cities are vital,
progressive, wealthy and grow-
ing at a tremendous rate. The
State has an enormous interest
in foreign trade.
These factors are all contrib-
uting to the ordeal of the Demo-
cratic party in the State, Allen
Duckworth of the Dallas Morn-
ing News says in the Southwest
Review: "The strength of the
Democratic party in Texas has
become its greatest weakness. It
is strangling itself in the coils
of a self-imposed political mo-
nopoly. By eliminating effective
opposition, the party has become
a public utility with little power
to govern itself and practically
no control over the rank and file
of voters who cast their ballots
in the Democratic column."
The Democratic party, there-
fore, is not a collection of like-
minded people. It is an instru-
ment—the only instrument—by
which government can be car-
ried on. But after officials are
elected through the mechanism
of the party, they go their sev-
eral ways. W. Lee O'Daniel, aft-
er election to the Senate, moved
to the extreme right in that
body. The two Nestors of Texas
politics, John N. Garner and Hat-
ton W. Sumners, find escape in
broad philosophic perspective on
life and government in general.
The present Governor, Beauford
Jester, prevailed over the left-
wing Homer P. Rainey in a
great conservative victory. Jes-
ter paid his party a doubtful
compliment. He said he always
voted his party ticket, "although
I sometimes had to hold my
nose." A lot of Texas noses
have been held in national elec-
tions since 1936.
The Republican party in Tex-
as is small and bitterly torn by
dissension. Much of the ma-
chinery of that party is held by
a rather small group of leaders
who claim they are seeking to
build up the party, but who are,
according to their opponents,
trying to keep the party weak
and manageable.
Its delegates to national con-
ventions are selected by meth-
ods that are almost wholly un-
provided for in the election laws.
This is not a question of ille-
gality. It is due to the fact that
the election laws provide almost
wholly for the Democratic party.
At the moment Republican Na-
tional Committeeman Robert B.
Creager makes it clear that he
is trying to enlarge the party
and that he hopes a national Re-
publican victory will greatly aid
that purpose.
He has on his hands, however,
a powerful insurgent movement
which centers in Dallas. He is
also confronted with a division
between those who favor Taft
and those who favor Dewey,
with Stassen steadily gaining
strength.
The first step toward building
up a real two-party system in
Texas would appear to be a dras-
tic revision of the laws dealing
with primaries, conventions and
elections. The next would be a
pacified Republican party, or-
ganized down to the grass roots
in the counties. The third would
be the emergence of vital young
men and women of both parties
who are determined to win for
this State a political system in
keeping with its massive impor-
tance in the economic life of the
nation.
