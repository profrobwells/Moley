Press-Gallery Boom.
This piece is not written to
disparage Sen. Arthur Vanden-
berg as a possible Presidential
candidate. Nor is it written to
take issue with those who be-
lieve him to be the best-equipped
man to receive the Republican
nomination. Vandenberg is a
man of stature. He has served
and is serving the cause of inter-
national co-operation with great
capacity and devotion. His posi-
tion in the Senate has been well-
He may or may not harbor an
ambition to be President, al-
though he has repeatedly dis-
claimed any intention of being
a candidate. He has also as-
serted that there can be no draft
unless the draftee connives at
it. He is not to blame for the
situation described below.
It is of interest to readers of
our magazines and newspapers
to know something of what is
happening in the processes
through which news and opin-
ion are created in Washington.
Although buyers of news de-
serve to get unbiased informa-
tion, they do not always get it.
They are not well served by
writers or commentators who,
by innuendo or lack of perspec-
tive, promote one candidacy and
disparage others. Such innuen-
dos and such distortion of
emphasis have characterized the
outpourings of several people of
late in writing about the Michi-
gan Senator. There is apparent-
ly a small and possibly inte-
grated boom for Vandenberg
emerging from an influential
group of writers, and this col-
umn is written to call attention
to it.
The boom takes form in what
purports to be authentic inside-
dope. We are told that Tru-
man's advisers are worried about
Vandenberg. They don't want
to have to run against him. They
would, it is said, much rather
contend with Taft. This, ladies
and gentlemen, is a back-handed
suggestion to Republicans that
they had better nominate Van-
denberg.
Another item came to us over
the air. It was said that betting
in the press gallery was 3 to 5
that Vandenberg would be nomi-
nated. I have been reliably in-
formed that this was a single
bet of 30 cents against 50 cents,
and since the alleged news of
these odds went to several mil-
lion people, the 30 cents was
well spent.
Day after day and week after
week, dibs and dabs of this sort
appear and, from what I already
know, a great deal more is in-
store on a more pretentious
scale.
Digs at Taft in connection with
.BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Vandenberg boosts are common.
Stassen and Dewey are occasion-
al victims.
Some of this press propaganda
comes through contacts with
Senators who for one reason or
another have been befriended by
Vandenberg and who are miffed
at Taft. This is not surprising,
since Taft has had to bear more
real responsibility in steering
legislation and in committee se-
lections than has Vandenberg.
But it is the duty of a smart re-
porter to judge the authenticity
of prejudiced opinions.
Another source is in the pref-
erence of some reporters for
Vandenberg's internationalism
and in their opposition to Taft's
limits on foreign aid.
Still another source is New
Dealers who anticipate Tru-
man's defeat and who hope the
new Republican President will
not be too persistent in clearing
out the administration. The opin-
ion of these people—and one of
the most persistent propagan-
dists has said this in print—is
that Vandenberg is by nature
leisurely and not too fond of
hard work. Dewey, Taft or Stas-
sen, on the other hand, would
very vigorously comb the bu-
reaus if elected.
Vandenberg deserves a fair
press, but he has been getting
some notices which quite over-
reach the true nature of news.
