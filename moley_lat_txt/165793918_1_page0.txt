State Department Is Not Suited to Run E.R.P.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Secretary Marshall's argu-
ments before the committees of
Congress leave the major ques-
tion about E.R.P. exactly where
it was two months ago.
Is the State Department quali-
fied to direct and administer the
program suggested? Marshall's
answer is that he is "concerned
in finding the best possible or-
ganization and management for
the program." But since it is
clear that he intends to operate
the program within the organi-
zation and authority of the State
Department, his answer is not
sufficient to bring forth the con-
fidence and support of the coun-
try. It is now up to Congress
to supply a better answer.
The inadequacy of the State
Department to administer E.R.P.
is rooted in the very nature and
functions of the diplomatic arm
of the government. The materi-
als with which a foreign service
deals are ideas, policies and in-
formation. A foreign service
does not deal, except through
words written on paper, with
actual construction of concrete
things or even with the prudent
spending or investment of
money. By training, experience
and temperament, men in the
foreign service are unsuited to
what Secretary Marshall admits
is "primarily a business, tech-
nical and engineering job."
A similar situation arose in
1933 when Congress authorized
$3,300,000,000 for public works.
The President handed the job
of administration to Interior
Secretary Ickes. The money was
not spent rapidly, due in part
to the extreme caution of Ickes.
But it was spent honestly and
fairly efficiently. The advantage
of giving it to Ickes, however,
was that the Interior Depart-
ment, with which public works
were closely related, was an in-
stitution dealing with concrete
things like land management,
reclamation, parks, mines and
the like.
But the State Department is
not even distantly related in na-
ture and function to the Interior
Department. To set up an engi-
neering show in that atmosphere
of sealing wax, spats and gos-
sipy reports would be like put-
ting an iron foundry into a hos-
pital.
It is no disparagement to sug-
gest that Gen. Marshall's train-
ing does not suit for such a job.
Undersecretary Lovett is a very
able man who is familiar with
large business enterprises. His
contact, however, has been that
of a banker, not a manager.
There are strong reasons for be-
lieving that Ambassador Lewis
W. Douglas is under considera-
tion for the European end of
E.R.P. Again, we have distin-
guished ability in many lines,
but little managerial experience.
Former Sen. Robert M. La Fol-
lette is being suggested for the
American end of the job. Here,
also, are great honesty and dis-
tinguished ability. But La Fol-
lette's experience has been in
politics and legislation. Even
William Clayton's experience
was in trade and commerce.
As we go down the line into
the rank and file of the Foreign
Service, the unsuitability of per-
sonnel for a recovery program
grows more pronounced. To give
this job to such personnel
would be like permitting the
faculty of a liberal arts college
to run a steel plant.
