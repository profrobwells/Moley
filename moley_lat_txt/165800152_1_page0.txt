The Republican Race_
At this moment, no one is
qualified to predict the choice
of the Republican convention in
June.
The following approximately
represents the present picture,
as far as I have been able to
gather the information.
It should be noted at the out-
set that pieces of the final an-
swer are being added every
week. The season for State
conventions is under way. In a
great majority of States there
are no Presidential preference
primaries and delegates are se-
lected either in district primaries
or in State and district conven-
tions. Delegates to these local
conventions are being selected
every day. Hence, wheels are
turning which are making ir-
revocable decisions and these
decisions, pieced together, will
spell the probable fate of the
various candidates.
The observer must caution
himself against generalized con-
clusions about such matters as
the effect of Truman's weak-
ness on the choice of the nation-
al convention. The fact that
it may look as if any Republican
can win will only partially influ-
ence the decision of the con-
vention. A convention has no
single mind which rationalizes
like yours and mine. It is a
vast complexity of many minds,
most of which have commit-
ments, prejudices and personal
preferences. So beware of the
conclusion, often heard, that Re-
publicans don't need Dewey (or
somebody else) to win.
First, let's look at Dewey. His
fate does not depend on Wiscon-
sin on April 6, although many
writers are saying so. He will,
in all probability, take a terrific
beating from MacArthur. It may
be a defeat that will look worse,
delegate-wise, than in popular
vote. In other words, it is pos-
sible that Dewey may win no
delegates. He may run, dele-
gate-wise, behind both MacAr-
thur and Stassen and still be the
choice of most Republican vot-
ers in the primary. In that case,
he will suffer what may be
called a psychological or pres-
tige setback which he can later
overcome. The Nebraska pri-
mary will take place the follow-
ing week, and if Dewey wins
that, he will be back where he
is now.

selected. Over all, a conserva-
tive estimate of his present
strength gives him nearly 200
delegates.
Taft, counting his probable
southern support and most of
Ohio, looks like a present assur-
ance of 150.
Stassen claims 270 as a final
figure, but unless surprising
things happen, this is high. Be-
cause of his incredible campaign,
he will pick up a good many
votes here and there and is as-
sured of about 100.
From here on, Dewey is like-
ly to gain most up to June 1.
It is entirely possible that he
will appear to be a winner by
that time. In politics, appear-
ances count heavily, and if
Dewey looks like a winner, many
favorite-son delegates may veer
his way.
The favorite-son States will be
Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Illinois and Cali-
His probable delegate strength
now is impressive and it is grow-
ing. He starts with the assur-
ance of New York's 97 and 6
from New Hampshire. He will
have 20 or more from South
Carolina and perhaps half of the
quotas of Florida and Louisiana.
He seems almost certain of 15
from Texas and 13 from Kansas.
Missouri is getting ready for its
State convention, and Dewey is
certain to have a good propor-
tion of the national delegates
fornia. The second choices of
those States will be important.
They will be decisive only if
Taft wins considerable support
in the North and West or if
Stassen reveals unexpected
strength in a number of spots
where he seems to have made a
very favorable impression.
MacArthur, despite his prob-
able victory in Wisconsin, has
no real delegate-getting strength
anywhere else, unless it is in
Illinois.
