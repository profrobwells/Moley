Why the South Is Angry
Wherever conversation turns
to politics these days, three
questions are asked. What is
it that the southern Governors
are so angry about? What can
they do about it? What are they
likely to do about it?
It may be useful to spell out
the answers to these questions,
since the President's civil rights
program is a rather bulky docu-
ment which few Americans have
had a chance to analyze and
since most Americans are hazy
about the way Presidents are
elected.
In December, 1946, President
Truman by executive order cre-
ated the President's Committee
on Civil Rights and directed it
"to inquire into and to deter-
mine" how Federal, State and
local laws and governments
might be "strengthened and im-
proved to safeguard the civil
rights of the people." Most of
the members of the committee
were Northerners, and several
of them have long been identi-
fied with movements favoring
Federal action against discrim-
inatory laws and practices.
Charles E. Wilson was chair-
man.
The committee apparently
took its job very seriously and,
after a year of work, turned
in a long report packed full of
specific recommendations for
new legislation and administra-
tive action by Federal, State and
local governments. Many of the
old and controverted measures
were recommended, such as a
Federal antilynching law, aboli-
tion of poll taxes as voting re-
quirements, Federal acts to pro-
tect the right of qualified per-
sons to vote in Federal elec-
tions, repeal of State laws es-
tablishing discrimination, pro-
hibition of discrimination in the
armed services, a Federal fair
employment practice act and a
number of other measures
aimed at abolishing discrimina-
tion. The report, in short, is a
catalogue of the issues which
in years past have stirred the
anger of southern people who
want such matters to be left
to their States.
Perhaps the recommendations
would not have disturbed the
South so much if the report
had not proposed to give its
measures a full set of very
sharp teeth. The first recommen-
dation was for a powerful Fed-
eral prosecuting and policing
agency in the Department of
Justice, with regional offices,
trained personnel, a special
FBI unit and even police train-
ing programs and schools. I
think it is no overstatement to
conclude that the report pro-
posed to lay a very heavy Fed-
eral hand on States which have
been most sensitive to interfer-
ence in what they regard as
State concerns.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gov. William Tuck of Vir-
ginia has taken the lead in
pointing out what Southern
States can do to punish the
President for what they regard
as a complete surrender to
northern Democratic and Re-
publican demands for Federal
action. He proposes that the Vir-
ginia ballot contain only the
names of the Presidential elec-
tors nominated for that State
and that such electors be free
to ignore the nominees of the
national conventions for Presi-
dent and Vice-President. This
is legally and morally possible
although it is a break with tra-
dition. Under this plan, after
election the Virginia electors
would be free to vote for some-
one other than the candidate of
their party or, possibly, to re-
fuse to vote at all. I say "pos-
sibly" because it can be argued
that by the use of the words
"shall vote," the Constitution
requires the electors to vote for
someone. By denying to Tru-
man their electoral votes, such
States as agree with the Vir-
ginia Governor would assure his
almost certain defeat.
The answer to the question
about what is likely to happen
is speculative. All that can be
said is that, if this is a bluff,
it is the most concrete bluff that
the South has made in many
years of protest. And it may be
the expression of an intention
of deadly seriousness.
