Wisconsin's Bad Primary Law BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For half a century Wisconsin
has been a laboratory of experi-
ments in government. Many
Wisconsin innovations have been
copied by other States and have
been excellent. Some, however,
have been bad, and the worst is
the Wisconsin primary law.
The essential evil of this law
will appear on April 6 when
Dewey, Stassen and MacArthur
will contest for delegates to the
National Republican Convention.
This primary will be big national
news and it will have a heavy
bearing on the Republican Par-
ty's choice of a candidate.
Under the Wisconsin law, vot-
ers in a primary may, without
declaring their choice, vote for
either Republican or Democratic
delegates. Hence, in such a pri-
mary as the forthcoming one,
Democrats with no real contest
in their own party may vote for
a Republican. It is assumed by
Dewey supporters that a great
majority of Democrats who will
cast Republican votes will choose
MacArthur. Independents who
switch back and forth will, it is
believed, likewise vote MacAr-
thur. Thus, the handicap imposed
on Stassen and Dewey is very
great, since they have both be-
come clearly identified as strictly
Republican.
Republicans in Wisconsin are
therefore prevented from making
a deliberate choice in what
should be a party primary. If
such a law prevailed in all States,
party government would be al-
most impossible to maintain, and
party responsibility would be nil.
If the Wisconsin primary were
restricted to Republicans, Dewey
would probably get most of the
delegates; Stassen would be a
good second, and MacArthur
would be third. As it stands,
MacArthur is likely to get a
majority of the delegates; Dewey
will probably get from 6 to 12 of
the 27 in the State, and Stassen
will probably get a lesser num-
ber. This is the estimate of
qualified observers at this time.
There may be changes later.
A personal campaign by Dew-
ey would help him a great deal.
Until recently, he took it for
granted that he could not go.
His duties in Albany are very
heavy because of the 30-day pe-
riod in which he must act on
bills passed by the Legislature.
His advisers have urged the ad-
vantage of showing himself in
Wisconsin and of making a num-
ber of aggressive speeches.
In evaluating the results in
Wisconsin, a heavy discount
must be levied against a MacAr-
thur success. The real test will
be the relative showing of Dew-
ey and Stassen. It must be borne
in mind that this is perhaps the
only place where MacArthur
can hope to get a considerable
number of delegates. Despite
strident support in certain news-
papers, information from various
parts of the country indicates no
real MacArthur sentiment. And
what there is, can hardly be in-
creased by what the general can
say on the issues.
In Wisconsin, it is said that
MacArthur is against universal
military training. What can he
say publicly on this subject? He
is still in government service
and the President is all out for
UMT. This is only one of the
many subjects on which it will
be hard for MacArthur to take a
stand. And no candidate is like-
ly to be nominated whose views
are limited to generalities—how-
ever nobly they may be ex-
pressed.
Heeling a Ward
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
An entirely new technique of
ward-heeling has been developed
by 60 high school girls at Sud-
bury, Mass., and the political
boss who doesn’t adopt it isn’t
swaying the electorate the way
he could.
These girls volunteered to
serve as baby sitters free for all
parents who wanted to go to
town meeting and vote. As they
received the names of applicants,
they began buttonholing them
to vote for a $15,000 gymnasium.
The gymnasium was voted.
Political machines have long
thrived by supplying the voters
with such little services as giv-
ing them buckets of coal and
fixing their parking tickets. But
the machine par excellence will
have been developed, we dare
predict, when a harried parent
in need of a baby sitter can call
the Fourth Ward Republican
Club and tell them to hurry
over a politician.
