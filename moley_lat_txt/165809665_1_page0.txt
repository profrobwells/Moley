Behind Political Fogs: a Brighter 1948
As the average American
reads the accounts of the politi-
cal jockeying that goes on in
Washington over European aid
and domestic inflation control,
he is likely to acquire a dark
picture of what 1948 has in store
for him. This is because this
political warfare deals in terms
of dire contingencies and of
blame-fixing. It views with
alarm.
The administration prepares to
blame the Republican Congress
for the consequences of ignoring
its remedies. And the Republi-
cans prepare to blame the Pres-
ident for badly handling our
economy yesterday, today and to-
morrow. It is not surprising
that the shades which emerge
are darker than are warranted.
The average American, how-
ever, is not primarily concerned
in what this or that party suc-
ceeds in proving. He is not
seeking public office or political
patronage. A most generous es-
timate of the number of people
whose personal interest is in-
volved in political affairs cannot
exceed two or three million or,
if we include all public job-hold-
ers, two or three million more.
This is a lot of people, but it
means that the great majority of
Americans—average Americans
—are interested in what hap-
pens to the country, rather than
to the parties. And so for the
moment it may be well to lift
our sights above the party con-
flict and see what we can see.
If, as many wise economists
believe, the key to inflation is in
food prices, the prospects are
not dark. From various reliable
sources, the following generali-
ties can safely be made:
In 1947, because of a bad win-
ter followed by drouth in the
summer, European crops were
worse than in 1946. Our own
corn crop was 850,000,000 bushels
less than in the preceding year.
A better wheat crop helped, but
did not equalize the situation.
Hence, because of exports and a
reduced supply of feed, our meat
supply was and is shorter, and
it may be short into and through
the summer.
The prospects for this year de-
pend, of course, on conditions
that cannot be exactly predicted.
But the expectations of long-term
observers are very hopeful. Such
observers say that two succes-
sive bad corn crops are possible
but not probable. There will be
less demand for corn for animal
feeding because there will be
fewer animals.
The wheat prospects are not so
good as 1947, but the Department
of Agriculture has estimated the
crop at 1,100,000,000 bushels.
Since that estimate was made,
weather conditions have been
more favorable. Some people in
the Department of Agriculture
now suggest, unofficially, that
the earlier estimate could be
raised to 1,200,000,000 or 1,300,-
000,000. That should be com-
pared with the 800,000,000 to 000,-
000,000 prewar "average.
In Canada, the auspices for a
good crop have been favorable,
and that will help materially.
The Argentine wheat crop,
which has just been harvested, is
much greater than was anticipat-
ed. The corn crop prospects in
Argentina are very good.
In Europe, prospects are much
better than they were last year
and the year before. The acre-
ages planted are larger. In Italy,
the acreage is close to the pre-
war average. The winter weath-
er in Europe has been favorable.
Europe has more fertilizers,
more draft power and better
seeds than last year.
Over the world the situation in
fats and oils is better. Rice pros-
pects are somewhat better than
last year, especially in Burma.
Russia is expected to export a
large amount of grain this year,
mainly to iron curtain countries
and to England. This is not cer-
tain, however, because Russian
production is less than it was be-
fore the war.
These favorable signs are
greatly discounted in the propa-
ganda circulated by various
agencies concerned in European
aid, which predict great scarci-
ties for years to come. But over-
all, a fair interpretation of avail-
able facts throws a rather favor-
able light on the prospects of
natural checks on inflation in
1948. For food is the heart of
the problem.
