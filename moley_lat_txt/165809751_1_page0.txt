Politics in Government Medicine
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The demotion of Dr. Thomas
Parran from the office of Sur-
geon General of the United States
Public Health Service has al-
ready turned loose a flood of po-
litical talk. Friends of Dr. Par-
ran are bitter. They charge this
up to the President's desire to
rid himself of all reminders of
F.D.R., to the management of the
Inner political circle and to the
pressure of medical politics on
the White House.
The action is defended as an
appeasement of Republican Sen-
ators who believe that Dr. Parran
has permitted his bureaucracy
to advocate too actively the prin-
ciple of "socialized medicine."
Dr. Parran himself wants no
fight that might injure the Pub-
lic Health Service to which he
has given so many years.
The situation shows that when
medical politics is mixed with
party politics and sprinkled with
bureaucratic politics, you have a
brew which is not good for the
health of the nation.
There is no question about the
singular capacity of Dr. Parran.
He has given his life to public
health—13 years as an officer of
the U.S.P.H.S., six years as
Health Commissioner of New
York State, then 12 years as Sur-
geon General in Washington. His
was, in fact, one of the best ap-
pointments ever made by the late
President.
Since Dr. Parran was a Roose-
velt "find," he enjoyed great sup-
port. More and more money was
provided in Presidential budgets
for his work. His ideas on legis-
lation had White House backing.
And the service of which he was
head became outstanding in the
world.
The Public Health Service has
undertaken new and vastly im-
portant functions. The National
Institute of Health, which is the
research branch of the service,
has been broadly increased. It
is, as one commentator put it,
"the most powerful death-fight-
ing laboratory in the world."
Dr. Parran has greatly ad-
vanced the progress of cancer re-
search and the control of tuber-
culosis. He has broken down the
veil of public reticence about
venereal diseases and has pro-
moted improved methods of
treating such diseases.
But the problems of public
health are bound to be enlarged
by complex political currents.
Within the medical profession
the bitter controversy rages be-
tween those who would intro-
duce more government into med-
icine and those who oppose them.
The Murray-Wagner-Dingell bill
is the center of this fight. Presi-
dent Truman has approved the
plan, as did his predecessor. Dr.
Parran was between two fires—
loyalty to his chief and loyalty
to the majority of the medical
profession. In all big public
health situations the influence
of private foundations is felt, and
sometimes this creates serious
conflicts. Finally, there is the
pressure of plain old-fashioned
ward politics.
It is noteworthy that the head
of the Federal Security Agency,
in which the Public Health Serv-
ice is located, is Oscar R. Ewing,
who was for a considerable time
assistant chairman and later vice-
chairman of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee. Ewing makes
the point that the office of Sur-
geon General should rotate, as
does that of the Army Chief of
Staff.
But the best guess is that the
President in an election year can
hardly afford a fight with Sena-
tors who oppose Dr. Parran on
the government medicine issue.
Still, the President will suffer
the wrath of those who feel that
this is another Roosevelt man
overboard.
