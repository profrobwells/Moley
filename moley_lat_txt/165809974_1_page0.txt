'Eventually-Why Not Now?' _ _BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The advertising slogan, "Even-
tually-Why Not Now?" char-
acterizes a feeling which has
rapidly gained ground in this
country in the last few weeks.
Pollsters report that half of our
people now regard war with
Russia as inevitable. Some-
fortunately not all believe in
letting the war come at once.
This, we must remember, is a
state of mind, not, a conclusion
based on solid facts. But it
hardly needs to be said that a
state of mind is often as dan-
gerous as a set of facts. It must
be approached, the psychologists
tell us, in two ways. The first
is to calculate whether the im-
mediate irritants which caused
the state of mind can be or are
likely to be removed. The sec-
ond is to examine the facts which
lie back of the mental reaction
to see whether they justify the
mental condition and whether
they are likely to change for the
better. This piece concerns it-
self with the first of these ap-
proaches.
It can be taken for granted
that the great majority of us do
not want to have a war now,
even if we believe a war is
bound to come sometime. That
majority takes the position that
even if our semipeace is living
on borrowed time, it is well to
use that time to the best possible
advantage. Our lives themselves
are borrowed from the infinite.
And our moral nature tells us
that we should try to live as long
as we can, despite the inevitabil-
ity of death.
But to use this figure with the
eventually-why-not-now people
brings a quick answer. They
say, "We are not talking about
suicide. We are talking about a
serious but necessary surgical
operation. Bring on the an-
esthetic and the knives now,
while our health is good and be-
fore the disease has made further
progress." And so the argument
ends, as arguments usually do
end, with no hits, no runs and
plenty of errors.
However, if we examine the
probabilities immediately ahead,
we can anticipate the weakening
of the melancholy sooner-the-
better conclusion. One factor in
the building up of this feeling
has been official propaganda for
ERP. Over and over in hearings
before Congressional committees,
witnesses have painted black
pictures of the crisis in Eu-
rope. These were, for the
most part, true and sincere. But
it is only human in such a case
to lay on the color a bit too
thick.
Since ERP is calculated to help
matters, we may assume that as
soon as it is passed we shall
hear from its advocates a bright-
er story about Europe. Secre-
tary Marshall may have gone
too far in calling the Czech
crisis a reign of terror. Certain-
ly, he could hardly have expected
the public to follow his advice
about keeping calm when he
was also telling us that there
was nothing to be calm about.
When high officials use words
to create public opinion, they
can never be sure how effective
their words may be. President
Roosevelt started a recession 10
years ago by some strong words
about prices. As the record
stands, Messrs. Truman and Mar-
shall have been none too astute
in selling ERP to the public.
There is bound to be some re-
action from the stress created by
their pronouncements.
The Italian election in April
will probably be the next crisis,
and if that is passed successfully
there will be some further easing
in the war of nerves.
All this, however, is based on
the uncertain assumption that
Russia will not provoke further
fear in the near future. The war
spirit may spread here if things
begin to happen in Berlin, in
Austria or in Scandinavia. But
barring that, we may expect an
easier spring.
