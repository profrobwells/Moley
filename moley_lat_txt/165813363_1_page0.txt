Is Berlin Next?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Communist Influences working
through German language news-
papers suggest that the western
'power's may evacuate Berlin.
This is taken, in our present
state of apprehension, to mean
that the next Soviet move may
be to claim the German capital.
This line of Soviet propaganda
has apparently been going on a
long time, since letters received
here from German leaders have
for some time expressed the fear
that the evacuation may be con-
templated.
The idea that some Russian
move in Berlin may be consid-
ered cannot be wholly dismissed.
If further expansion is planned,
Berlin may be the next point of
pressure.
In considering this possibility,
it may be useful to recall the ex-
act situation of Berlin. It is vir-
tually an interallied island with-
in the Russian-occupied area.
To the east is the Polish frontier,
25 miles away. The British zone
at its closest point is 100 miles
distant.
Within greater Berlin are four
zones. The Russian part contains
the university and the major
libraries. The British zone has
much of the remains of the en-
gineering and electrical indus-
tries. The American zone con-
tains some of the best-preserved
suburbs of the city. And the
French zone is a sector of diver-
sified industry.
If Russia is determined to take
over all of Berlin, what might
be the course of action?
One method might be an ulti-
matum followed by an attempt
to push out the troops and ad-
ministrative setups of the three
western powers. This is hardly
likely at the moment, because
such a move would be an act of
war.
Another procedure would be
to make traffic between Berlin
and the western zones practical-
ly impossible. This would im-
mediately invite retaliation
which would be serious for the
inhabitants and for the Rus-
sian occupying forces. All of Ber-
lin's industry, as well as most of
the Russian zone outside the city,
is dependent on coal from the
Ruhr. Russia could hardly gain
by such a move.
A third move might be the fos-
tering of a revolt within the city,
followed by the emergence of a
stooge German Communist gov-
ernment. In such an event, there
would be no reason for the
evacuation of the western pow-
ers' troops and administrators.
Again, any move by a Commu-
nist political group in the west-
ern zones would meet physical
resistance, and that might also
lead to war.
It is more likely that for the
time being Russia intends to car-
ry on propaganda designed to
frighten non-Communist German
politicians and trade unions and
to win them away from the
West. Such methods have al-
ready had some success. In the
nation-wide conventions of the
Social Democrats, there were
sharp differences between the
representatives from the Russian
zone and the others. Differences
have been even sharper within
the Democratic Party. A former
Democratic Reichsminister,
Kuelz, was ousted from office
in the party at a recent meet-
ing in Frankfurt because, it
was charged, he was too pro-
Russian.
No one can tell from day to
day where the bear's paw will
fall. But there are more likely
places than Berlin.
