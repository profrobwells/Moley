A Sound German Labor Leader
Some years ago, this column
pointed up the importance to a
reconstructed Germany of Fritz
Tarnow, a German trade union
leader then in exile. In charac
ter, antecedents and viewpoint,
Tarnow represented the best in
pre-Hitler Germany. He now
appears as zonal secretary of
trade unions in the United States
zone or occupation. His views
on the place of trade unions in
a democratic state appear in a
statement by him in the AFL's
February Labor Monthly Sur-
vey.
Tarnow's views underline the
best in past AFL doctrine con-
cerning the relationship of un-
ions to the government and to
political parties.
Unions should, he says, be in-
dependent, although they should
expect political parties to press
for legislation favorable to un-
ions.
Moreover, he raises his strong
voice to define the nature of a
democracy in which trade unions
can be safe. It is, in short, the
antithesis of all that Soviet doc-
trine and policy stand for.
The use of Tarnow by our oc-
cupation government and this
recognition by the AFL becomes
more significant as we review
Tarnow's public career.
When Hitler came to power,
Tarnow was the head of one
of the oldest and most powerful
of German unions--that of the
lumber and wood workers. Un-
der the Nazis he was promptly
jailed and promptly escaped. Hit-
ler took pains to denounce him
personally, over the radio. He
used against him the familiar
smear that he lived too well.
He said that Tarnow occupied
a luxurious office decorated with
wood carvings paid out of the
laborers' pennies.
Some years ago, Tarnow wrote
a little book, after a trip to
America in 1927. The book was
called "Why Stay Poor?" In it
he pointed out that the German
worker, if he followed American
methods of efficiency, would
never be brought to the Marxist
status of "pauperization." He
might bring himself to wealth in
a "reasonably" organized and
only partly socialized world.
Shortly after the publication of
the book the great depression
arrived, and, as a plan for im-
provement, Tarnow, together
with two economists, proposed
something similar to our RFC.
This was rejected by the Social-
ists. It also was contrary to
Hitler's plans for the enslave-
ment of both the managers and
workers in industry.

In 1933, Tarnow fled to Den-
mark and there became head of
the trade union underground
movement. When Hitler seized
Denmark, in 1940, Tarnow es-
caped by sea to Sweden and tried
to continue his work there. This
was more difficult because many
of his fellow exiles fell into the
trap of Communist propaganda.
He was allowed to return to Ger-
many in 1946.
Tarnow's strictures on the re-
lations of trade unions with pol-
itics set forth in the AFL pub-
lication must be considered in
light of his background. He al-
ways belonged to the Social
Democratic Party. In principle,
therefore, he was in favor of a
very gradual nationalization of
business and wealth. The real
interest of workers, he held, was
in the efficiency of workers as a
precondition to larger shares in
the national income.
It would be a great national
service if the AFL would per-
mit Tarnow to extend his re-
marks in their publication to in-
form American labor of this
considered opinion of efficiency
as a basic obligation of labor.
Such a pronouncement would
help more than all the pleas of
management. But is the AFL
willing to sponsor such doc-
trine?
