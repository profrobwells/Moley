On Predicting Elections_
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In an issue of this column
written for release the day be
fore the irresistible ex-Governor
met the immovable Senator in
Ohio, there appeared the state-
ment that Stassen would get
"S to 10 delegates." He won
9. This is not now recalled
to win for the author of this
column any acclaim as a prophet.
It deserves to be said that what-
ever credit is due belongs to
Richard Maher, political reporter
for the Cleveland Press, from
whom I solicited the informa-
tion
On the other hand, a Pulitzer
prize winner in Washington
made an estimate of 16 for Stas-
sen. There were other bad
guesses along the Potomac.
This column is written to
make a point which should be
noted by any enlightened citi-
zen who is interested in the flow
of political news. Reporters, as
well as other people, reflect what
is close to them. Only in rare
cases can they project them-
selves mentally into another en-
vironment. Hence, Washington
reporters are best on Washing-
ton news.
But in a national election the
best guidance comes from the
many reporters in the many lo-
cal areas. The local political re-
porter has the "feel" of his com-
'munity, he knows the politicians
and officeholders; he meets
many people, hears a lot of gos-
sip and lives in an environment
which is constantly reacting to
political events. Moreover, he
has a pride in his workmanship.
He wants his copy to be right,
regardless of his personal preju-
dices and wishes. Objectivity
makes him a good reporter.
In light of this, I studied the
Congressional campaign two
years ago by traveling from
State to State seeking advice and
information from political re-
porters in large and small cities.
Then, on the basis of their col-
lective judgments, first obtained
by personal contacts and later
hy telephone and mail, 10 days
before the election I put into
print an estimate of the number
of seats the two parties would
win in the election. That esti-
mate was within two seats in
the House and one in the Sen-
ate. Again, local political re-
porters had provided the correct
answer.
Although polls are useful in
political evaluations, they must
be b√•lanced against many other
considerations. It takes time to
take a poll and to compile the
returns. Public opinion is a mov-
ing pattern. Opinion polls are
based on sampling, and there are
always dangers in the size and
locale of the sample. The peo-
ple interviewed do not always
interpret the question properly,
and they are likely to answer
without premeditation. And
when they are asked to appraise
a general situation, they are
heavily handicapped by their
own wishes.
Above all, never take at face
value the prediction of a candi-
date or of his manager. Their
statements are intended to in-
luence, not to inform,
Finally, it should be said and
said again that the real contribu-
Lion of any political reporter or
commentator is not prophecy.
His joh is to give his readers
the material for wise judgments..
Most important in politics is
what ought to happen, not what
might happen.
