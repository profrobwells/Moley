No Smoke-Filled Room.
To Raymond A. McConnell
Jr., editor of the Journal news-
papers in Lincoln, Neb., credit
is due for making possible the
only real test we shall get of
the relative popularity of Re-
publican candidates.
Wisconsin was not a good
test. It was in Stassen's front
yard. He had a long-standing
organization there and enjoyed,
as did Dewey in New Hamp-
shire, the support of the Repub-
lican organization. MacArthur
was set up as a favorite son.
Hence, Dewey was licked from
the start.
Nebraska is another story. All
candidates were entered on fair-
ly even terms. The avowed can-
didates spread their wares. The
voting population is representa-
tive of most of America-partly
urban, partly rural.
The nation-wide attention this
test received reveals in an ex-
ceedingly forceful way how
wretchedly undemocratic is our
method of choosing Presidential
candidates. The Presidential pri-
mary, hailed 35 years ago as a
great progressive step, has failed
miserably. For many reasons
candidates warily avoid such
tests. The favorite-son idea of-
fers an excuse to keep outside
candidates from participating.
As a result, nominations are
made by all sorts of conventions
and committees. And every na-
tional convention runs the risk
of a deadlock, which can and
almost always does give us a
candidate who is not a popular
choice and who usually makes
a poor President. No dark horse
President ever succeeded him-
self. That is the verdict of his-
tory.
The Nebraska lesson should
provide guidance for delegates
from all States. It will provide
guidance for those who are suf-
ficiently conscientious to want
to give the people the candidate
they prefer. Such delegates
might well resolve that one of
the three Nebraska leaders
should be nominated. That is a
valid conclusion, because Stas-
sen, Dewey and, Taft are likely
to have most delegates. To per-
mit these three to reach a stale-
mate would be a reflection not
only on these candidates them-
selves, but also on the delegates.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There will be plenty of people
at the Philadelphia convention
who will try to overturn all
three and foist upon the country
a "smoke-filled room" choice.
The great States of Illinois and
Pennsylvania will have 129 votes
to throw around. There will be
devious and selfish attempts to
seek a candidate whose roots are
in the past. Two such men are
already talked about.
But Taft, Stassen and Dewey
have distinctions which entitled
them to special consideration.
They will probably lead in dele-
gates, and their public careers
belong with the generation
which has come of age since
Roosevelt entered the White
House. This is a year when
youth should have the call. The
next President will have a stu-
pendous burden to carry. He
must not only be incredibly vital
and active; he must have a mind
sufficiently flexible to marshal
policies which are in harmony
with postwar facts.
All the leading candidates can
answer those specifications.
Delegates need not look else-
where for a candidate.
