THE WINNING OF WARREN_
The nomination of Earl War-
ren was the outcome of 12
hours of intense negotiation,
consultation and cogitation. No
one knew, except perhaps War-
ren himself, whether the Cali-
fornia Governor would accept
second place on the ticket. War-
ren is slow to make a decision
and is, moreover, scrupulous
about his obligations to Cali-
fornia.
Hence, the question was not
merely to bring about agree-
ment on a candidate among the
various factions. It also involved
winning the consent of Warren
himself.
Dewey was the central figure
in both proceedings.
As is generally known, War-
ren was Dewey's first choice in
1944. When Warren reached
Chicago in that convention, he
was greeted by emissaries of
Dewey, who attempted to win
his consent to run for the Vice-
Presidency. The inducements
were, first, to make the job
tolerable on the material side
and, second, to make it more ac-
tive and interesting. Dewey sug-
gested that he was not the man
to let a person of Warren's ad-
ministrative capacities rust in
the Vice-President's chair in the
Senate.
At the recent Philadelphia
convention the effort to reach
unanimous agreement on a can-
didate began soon after Dewey's
acceptance speech. After his re-
turn to his rooms in the Bellevue-
Stratford around midnight,
Dewey summoned representa-
tives of the unsuccessful candi-
dates, together with other influ-
ential people.
There was no direct represent-
ative of Warren present. But the
man there who knew most about
Warren was Kyle Palmer, vet-
eran political writer of the Los
Angeles Times. Throughout the
proceedings which ended in the
nomination Friday, Palmer was
a major figure. He had the full
confidence of both Dewey and
Warren, although he represented
neither. But Palmer was in a
position to say positively that,
although Warren was not a can-
didate, he would allow his name
_ By Raymond Moley
to go before the convention-if
that were the wish of Dewey and
if it met the approval of the
party leaders.
The conference in Dewey's
room lasted until after 4 a.m.
Intense concentration prevailed,
with Dewey acting not only as
moderator but as chief question-
er. One name after another was
suggested, discussed and elimi-
nated. Palmer was the chief
source of information about the
California Governor and, accord-
ing to those present, his lucid
and objective description con-
vinced the conferees that they
had found their man.
Then, at 4:30 a.m., Warren was
awakened and invited to come
to Dewey's headquarters. No
offer of the nomination was
made, but Dewey thoroughly ex-
plored Warren's reasons for hesi-
tating to take the job. Finally,
without any commitment on
either side, the situation was
clarified.
At 9:30 a.m. the conferees met
again, without Warren, and voted
their decision. Warren then
agreed to run.
