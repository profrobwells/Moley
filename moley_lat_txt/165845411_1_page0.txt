Tennesseans Are Enjoying
a Brisk Senatorial Campaign
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Nothing quite like this color-
ful, complex and unpredictable
campaign has ever been seen in
Tennessee.
The center of national inter-
est, of course, is the fight for a
precious and perhaps indis-
pensable Republican seat in the
Senate. Carroll Reece may lay
this prize in the lap of an
anxious Republican Party, and,
if so, he will be acclaimed with
much more vim than was ap-
parent for his effective work as
chairman of the national com-
mittee in the years before Dew-
ey's nomination in Philadel-
phia. Whatever happens, he is
waging a remarkable battle.
Reece is more like the Will
Hays of earlier days than any-
one who has appeared in poli-
tics in 30 years. He has the
same lean, nervous, hungry
look of the born politician. He
speaks in generalities in which
Americanism is Republicanism,
and Republicanism is the gos-
pel. He is very, very conserva-
tive and he has a shrewd way
of welding many elements into
a workable political organiza-
tion.
Since getting crowds and win-
ning their attention is the first
requisite of a political appeal,
Reece has a major advantage.
Roy Acuff, Republican candi-
date for Governor, is an enter-
tainer. Tennessee has paid good
money to Roy for a long time
for the music of his Smoky
Mountain voice and his fiddling
virtuosity. The thrifty citizens
of the hills and valleys are now
getting for nothing what they
used to buy, and they are tak-
ing advantage of the opportu-
nity. And in every pause Reece
tosses in a golden Republican
word. That means that Reece
is in the news and in the
rhythmic consciousness of his
countrymen.
Reece has other, less colorful
but solid advantages. He was
long a Congressman from East-
ern Tennessee and has a good
machine out there. He has good
contacts among moneyed men
nationally because of his expe-
rience as national chairman.
No doubt, therefore, there will
be ample finances for the final
days of the campaign.
He is opposing Estes Kefau-
ver, a man who has won the
burning ill will of Boss Crump
of Memphis. Crump is not no-
ticeably active, but it would not
be in character if he did not
quietly work for the defeat of
his enemy. He was beaten by
Kefauver in the primaries, but
a boss struck to earth can rise
to boss again.
Kefauver was not helped by
an indorsement from Henry
Wallace. This may not have
been a kiss of death, but it left
red lipstick on the Democratic
candidate which is hard to
erase.
All in all, the Senate race is
an even bet. The final result
may depend on whether Dewey
or Truman carries the State,
and on this point observers are
about evenly divided.
