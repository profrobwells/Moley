Our Russian Policy.
The State Department has now
issued another blast at the
U.S.S.R. in the current cold war
of hot words. It is a listing of
37 cases of Soviet violations of
international agreements. It is
a list which will probably be
followed by an answer impres-
sive only to the Communists and
Henry Wallace. There has been
quite an exchange since Ambas-
sador Smith accidentally threw
the ball into play.
True, Gen. Smith says he was
imposed upon. Considering the
fact that he is no diplomat, that
is not surprising. But of all
places where we need a diplo-
mat, who won't be imposed
upon, it is the Kremlin. Gen.
Smith is only the latest of a
long series of Ambassadors, be-
ginning with William Bullitt 15
years ago, who seem to have
been inept. This is not to argue
that the Soviet government has
a case. It is merely to say that
we have not sent a represent-
ative there whose personal quali-
fications seem to be equal to
the job.
The Kremlin in these days is
a place for an American Ambas-

sador of the quality of Charles
Francis Adams, who held off
Britain during our Civil War,
or John Bigelow, who accom-
plished the same thing in France
at the same time. It may be
hard to get a man of that cali-
ber, but certainly there are
many American business and
professional men who are more
skillful in negotiation than is
Gen. Smith.
The character of the Soviet-
American exchange — as evi-
denced by the State Depart-
ment's statements and some hos-
tile and misleading press com-
ments which have appeared — is
hardly favorable to American
prestige in Western Europe
and in Asia. There are increas-
ing suggestions that Gen. Mar-
shall himself might step down
and give somebody else a
chance. As one man put it: "A
manager in big league baseball
may be a great fellow, but if he
can't win games, somebody else
must step in."
Our government is dealing
with a power which has little
diplomatic principle, it is true.
Also, the Soviet government has
developed the art of exaspera-
tion to an astonishing degree.
But that makes it still more es-
sential that we turn such moves
of the Soviet as their first state-
ment and Stalin's answer to Wal-
lace to better account in West-
ern Europe and the rest of the
world. It is not sufficient to say
that we use only American
methods.
As it is, we are creating the
impression that our diplomatic
moves are determined in the
light of a political campaign at
home. That is what the Wallace
exchange suggested to the world.
We are dealing with a situa-
tion in which our answers can-
not all be negative. Nor can
they be confined to the repeti-
tion of propositions we have
made in the past and which Rus-
sia ignored or rebuffed. We
must invent new propositions
which would show no weaken-
ing in our position but which
would put Russia to the pains
of finding new reasons for dis-
agreement.
In short, we must re-establish
the diplomatic offensive which
we have surrendered to Russia.
