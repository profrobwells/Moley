TRIMMING THE ERP.
A little less heat and more
light would be helpful in ap-
praising the cut in the ERP
made by the House of Repre-
sentatives. Some of the eastern
denunciation of the reduction is
downright hysterical.
It is "a stab in the back," "a
boon to Russia," "selfish isola-
tionism" and other things 100
terrible to repeat. The cut hard-
ly measures up to such infamous
terms, although it may have
been unwise from the stand-
point of domestic and interna-
tional politics.
There was nothing sacred or
irrevocable about the original
figure of $6,533,000,000 for the
first year of the plan. Some of
the circumstances were bound
to change, and some but not all
have changed.
In the beginning the Euro-
pean beneficiary countries asked
for $29,000,000,000 over a four-
year period. After some cutting
the administration came up with
a figure of $6,530,000,000 for the
year. Then some more was add-
ed for China and some other
countries, bringing the total to
more than $7,000,000,000.
At that time it was assumed
in Congress that the administra-
tion's $7,000,000,000 figure was
set as the basis of bargaining.
Sen. Taft suggested a consider-
ably lower amount, as did for-
mer President Hoover. Then
came the rapid deterioration of
Russian relations, the rape of
Czechoslovakia and the Italian
elections. The administration
took heart and stuck to the orig-
inal figure. Finally the advo-
cates of a lower figure gave
ground, and $6,533,000,000 was
agreed upon. At the same time
demands for national defense
were lifted by $4,000,000,000.
All this, of course, increased
very greatly the prospects of
"super-inflation"â€”a fact which
enabled the Truman administra-
tion to look more hopefully to-
ward November.
