The Boeing Strike.
The current strike at the Seat
tle plant of the Boeing Airplane
Co., now in its fifth week, has
national significance on two
counts. First, it has halted vital
defense operations and, second,
it involves the integrity of a
basic principle of the Taft-Hart
ley Act. In addition, there is a
question of elementary justice
to the company and to the city
of Seattle.
The company has a backlog
of orders amounting to $300,-
000,000 from the government
and from private companies. As
a part of the government's arma-
ment program, Boeing is turn-
ing out the B-50, which is a
super edition of the famous B-29.
It is also producing the C-97
stratofreighter, which is an Ar-
my cargo and troop transport.
Furthermore, there is the XB-47
jet bomber, an incredible jet
and rocket dreadnaught. On the
civil side is the immense strato
cruiser.
The manufacture of these
planes at the Seattle plant has
virtually reached a standstill.
The origins of the trouble go
back more than a year. At that
time, the Aeronautical Mechan-
ics' Union was operating under
a wartime contract with the
company. That contract had a
no-strike clause. Negotiation
with the company for a new
contract began early last year.
The company offered 10 cents
an hour pay increase and asked
for a modification of a partio-
ularly restrictive seniority rule
which, the company asserted,
prevented the transfer of em-
ployees and hampered the di-
rection of the working force.
The union rejected the offer and
voted to strike at that time. The
parent machinists' union re-
fused permission to the local to
strike, and work went on under
the old contract.
In January of this year, after
negotiations had been reopened,
the company offered a 15-cent
increase. The union demanded
35 cents and other concessions.
Also, it took the position that
it would not arbitrate, under
the contract provision that the
old contract should stay in effect
until a new contract was agreed
upon. When the company re-
fused this ultimatum, the local
called a strike. No membership
vote was taken on this strike
order by the union officials.
They held that the year-old
strike vote held, despite the fact
that two-thirds of the present
15,000 union employees did not
work for the company a year
ago.
The old strike vote, moreover,
was not taken on the basis of
the company's latest offer. At
that point, the Taft-Hartley Act
came into the picture. Boeing
holds that no 60-day notice was
given, as that act requires. The
Taft-Hartley Law states that
when this provision is violated
the strikers shall lose their
status as employees for the pur-
pose of collective bargaining.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The company therefore feels
that it has no right under the
law to engage in collective bar-
gaining with the union and it
has notified the government of
that position. Meanwhile, the
union has filed charges with the
NLRB. The company has se-
cured an injunction from the
Federal court against mass pick-
eting.
This is the first strike the
Boeing people have had in their
32 years of life. Competitively,
they were at a disadvantage at
the end of the war because they
were at that time almost exclu-
sively engaged in manufactur-
ing the B-29. They were com-
pelled when work stopped on
that war model to take time out
to develop new models for
peacetime production.
The plant at Seattle labors
under some difficulties because
of its strategic position. It is re-
garded as a vital industry at the
very frontier in the event of a
war with Russia. Increasing di-
version of its work to other
cities might be anticipated. This
is where the concern of the
city of Seattle comes in. Clear-
ly, the city would suffer from
such diversion. Moreover, if the
red flag of industrial trouble
is raised, the effect would be to
keep new industry from moving
to the Pacific Northwest. The
region as well as the nation is
deeply interested in this critical
test of the efforts of Congress
to bring order into industrial
relations.
