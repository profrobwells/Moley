Plain speaking is in order on
the critical importance of the
health and energy of a Chief
Executive of the United States.
Physical qualifications should be
foremost among the require-
ments for that office. A solemn
responsibility rests upon all dele-
gates who will select candidates
and upon those who write and
speak for public guidance to take
health into consideration in
judging candidates.
To see intimately the day-to-
day life of a President is to re-
alize that his is the most de-
manding job in the nation-per-
haps in the world. Some Presi-
dents, like Coolidge, have given
the appearance of calm and lei-
sure. But that was an illusion.
Even Coolidge died after only
four years of retirement, at 61,
which was far short of the span
which might have been expected
in a man of such hardy stock.
The day of a President begins
early, with bedside or breakfast
conferences, messages and prob-
lems. He must then make deci-
sions about what he shall do
with his day. No one can make
these decisions for him. Then
he blocks out a good part of his
office time into 5-10-15-minute
conferences and interviews. Ev-
eryone who sees him wants
something. These short visits
are hard work for the President.
He must think fast about how
he can answer the requests, re-
spond to the obvious or pass the
buck to a subordinate.
And he must at all times sedu-
lously guard his tongue, for even
a President's most casual utter-
ances are carried forth and re-
peated dozens of times, despite
injunctions of secrecy. He must
eat his lunch in the midst of
this intense mental strain, which
any adult knows is not good for
the system.
Afternoon passes with more
conferences, public appearances
and the study of grave matters
of state. His Cabinet members
are exacting in their demands.
They are anxious to cover or
reinforce their decisions with
Presidential approval. They dis-
agree and often quarrel among
themselves. These rivalries are
always carried to the President.
It must be remembered that
a President cannot delegate top
decisions. Every big problem
must pass his desk, and only he
can say the final word. This is
true, no matter how competent
his advisers may be.
Evenings are often taken up
with dinners, speeches or con-
ferences. Official dinners are
hardly enjoyed by anyone, espe-
cially by the host. Then, later,
there is the inevitable pile of
documents at the study table or
beside the bed. How a President
can sleep after such a day and
before another similar day is a
problem that each President has
had to figure out for himself.
F.D.R. was fairly fortunate in
his temperament. But we all
saw the wear and tear of years
finally pinch out the flame of
life.
Four Presidents have died
from causes that were at least
aggravated or precipitated by of-
ficial strain. Another, Wilson,
was hopelessly broken.
These are a few of the consid-
erations that conscientious dele-
gates to the Republican conven-
tion should have in mind as they
meet in Philadelphia.
