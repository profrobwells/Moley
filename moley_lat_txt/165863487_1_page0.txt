Although the campaign for the
Republican nomination is getting
very warm, the articulate candi-
dates-Taft, Dewey and Stassen
--reveal only small differences of
opinion on the issues. The real
choice is among personalities,
And each candidate, whatever he
may be saying, is trying to get
over to those he meets or ad-
dresses his personal qualifica-
tions for the job.
Perhaps this is for the best,
and it may be hoped that the per-
sonal appeal will not become too
personal; in short, that the rivals
will not get to the point of per-
sonal attacks on each other. So
far, it has been a gentlemanly af-
fair, with none of the name-call-
ing which characterized the
Theodore Roosevelt-William H.
Taft primary fights in 1912.
The general agreement on prin-
ciple among the Republican as-
pirants once more reveals how
greatly the public really makes
issues. Stassen, Dewey and Taft
are trying to sell themselves to
a vastly conglomerate public.
One day Stassen may be address-
ing a group of extremely con-
servative businessmen. The next
day he may be speaking to a
group of farmers who once be-
longed to the Nonpartisan
League. In all cases he is con-
cerned with the general impres-
sion he leaves. It is much the
same with Taft and, to a lesser
degree, with Dewey. Candidates
for a nomination do not ordi-
narily raise broad issues of pol-
icy. They hesitate to divide their
party.
In the present case, the bipar-
tisan foreign policy prevents a
real attack on President Truman,
except to point out deficiencies in
administration.
In the present state of the
campaign, the real business is
being done behind the scenes.
Unless the Stassen momentum
becomes sufficient to start a pre-
convention stampede, the three
candidates will, on the first bal-
lot, have in all less than 700
votes, and no one will be within
150 or more of a majority. Sec-
ond choices are being eagerly,
even desperately, sought. Man-
agers of all candidates are hunt-
ing out delegates and State lead-
ers and working on them with
all the persuasiveness of light-
ning-rod salesmen. A good many
king-makers not officially at-
tached to any camp are abroad
in the land, working for various
candidates, including some not-
so-dark, or perhaps we should
say gray, horses like Martin and
Vandenberg.
Among the publishers and edi-
tors assembled in New York re-
cently there was unlimited talk
of the Republican candidates.
One would be foolish to gen-
eralize too much about such a
vast assortment of opinions. But
it is clear that when the clans
gather in Philadelphia there will
be several favorite sons who
will passionately believe they
have a chance. It is also clear
that both Martin and Vanden-
berg are really bitten with the
Presidential bug.
It is becoming more and more
clear that the convention may
see protracted trial runs. In
other words, after the leaders
seem to be at a halt, there will
be trials for Vandenberg and pos-
sibly Martin. If the leaders hold
firm, these trials, it is said, will
fail. Then will come a series of
trial runs for favorite sons—per-
haps for Green of Illinois, Bald-
win of Connecticut, Warren of
California and others, and even
for some Governors who are not
now favorite sons. If that skir-
mishing fails to produce a candi-
date, the swing may go back to
the leaders.
Hence, the leaders—Stassen,
Taft and Dewey—are taking no
chances now on alienating any
powerful interest. And hence the
tendency now on the part of all
articulate candidates to raise no
real differences of opinion.
