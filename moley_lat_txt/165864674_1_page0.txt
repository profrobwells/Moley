Desperate Democrats, notably
hosses like Jacob M. Arvey of
Chicago, are frantically looking
toward Eisenhower as the man
to save their party and the in-
numerable local jobs, privileges
and perquisites that pertain to
power. Likewise, the James
Roosevelt faction in California
is agonized to see the likelihood
of Wallace's snatching away its
doubtful majority in that State.
Gen. Eisenhower can hardly
be unaware of the embarrassing
position that this creates for
him. No doubt, he privately ex-
presses views of the draft-Eisen-
hower business in language that
would endear him forever to
every top sergeant who ever
served in his great army.
It is not enough to say, as he
did with dignity and precision,
that he could not run for the
Republicans. It is not enough
for him to accept a job which
sought him on the basis that Co-
lumbia needed a President, not
a candidate. The draft-Eisenhow-
er Democrats simply refuse to
listen.
Nor does the logic of the case
seem to settle the question. The
logic is that a man would be
foolish to reject a Republican
nomination this year and then
accept a nomination from a par-
ty that is desperate, divided and
apparently headed for defeat.
As Hamlet said to his mother:
Could you on this fair moun-
tain leave to feed, and batten
on this moor?
A much greater issue rises,
which Eisenhower undoubtedly
sees very well. How would his-
tory judge a great general, de-
servedly the idol of his country-
men, if he took advantage of
that popularity to push aside
his civil Commander in Chief,
who appointed him Chief of
Staff and under whom he served
for three years? That is what
an Arvey-Roosevelt coup d'etat
would mean.
History is full of precedents,
good and bad, of military men
who have pushed aside civil
leaders. The conquering general
is always more popular than
the frock-coated civilian. When
it was arranged that Abraham
Lincoln should attend Ford's
Theater on April 14, 1865, the
original plan was to have Gen.
Grant accompany him. But such
was Grant's popularity in Wash-
ington that his presence would
have precipitated a friendly riot.
Grant was no man to steal the
show. He also was irked by
public attention. He slipped out
of town that day. Lincoln went
almost unnoticed.
Latin-American history is full
of instances in which a popular
general has gently or urgently
set aside an elected President.
Occasionally, however, the gen-
eral has risen above the tempta-
tion. In 1861, the long civil
war in Mexico had reached its
end. Gonzalez Ortega, the mili-
tary commander of the Consti-
tutionals, captured the capital.
Ortega was the hero of the hour.
The quiet, unromantic Benito
Juarez, the legitimate President,
was in Vera Cruz. The slight-
est disposition to capitalize on
popularity would have deposed
Juarez and elevated Ortega. But
Ortega was a man of singular
honor and foresight. He induced
Juarez to stop at the outskirts
of Mexico City while he pre-
pared the way for a great entry
for his chief. Juarez, entered
in triumph, and Ortega lives in
history for his refusal to take a
short cut to power.
Eisenhower must know this.
And those who are trying to
draft him are not serving the
general's true fame. They are
serving their own selfishness.
