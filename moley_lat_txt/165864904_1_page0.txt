Since former Secretary of
State Cordell Hull, in his cur-
rently published memoirs, has
chosen to open the tomb of the
1933 London economic confer-
ence and since I am made the
central figure in two of Mr.
Hull's installments, I am con-
strained to offer a brief reply.
Summed up, the nest of Mr.
Hull's long-standing complaints
seems to be that President
Roosevelt chose to invest me
with more direct responsibility
than was consistent with a prop-
er status and dignity of the dele-
gation; second, that I received
too much publicity in the Euro-
pean press.
With reference to the first of
Mr. Hull's complaints, the issue
was between Mr. Hull and Mr.
Roosevelt. Since similar senti-
ments have been entertained by
Mr. Hull over the years since
regarding George Peek, Sumner
Welles, Harry Hopkins, Joseph
E. Davies, William J. Donovan,
Patrick Hurley and many oth-
ers, the infection seems to have
been chronic and not due to any
act of mine.
In my case, the rationale of
Mr. Roosevelt's habit of dealing
directly with a subordinate was
rooted in a specific agreement—
fully understood and agreed to
by Mr. Hull and me before we
accepted our respective positions
in the government. It was an
unfortunate administrative ar-
rangement; I knew it and made
my doubts clear to the Presi-
dent. It was to be temporary,
however, and, weeks before the
London affair, I had agreed to
enter a publishing enterprise in
which I am still happily en-
gaged. The 12 years' unhappi-
ness of Mr. Hull over Mr. Roose-
velt's habit of direct dealing was
rooted in the respective natures
of the two men, Mr. Roosevelt
was a man of impulse; Mr. Hull
a believer in formality.
Mr. Hull's complaint that I
received too much attention in
Europe is made clear by what
Mr. Hull himself says. The oth-
er nations at London hoped for
three things, he says: First, re-
lief from the war debts owed to
the United States; second, cur-
rency stabilization; third, tariff
reform.
As Mr. Hull says, I had been
vested by the President with re-
sponsibility for the debts. He
also says that stabilization was
a Treasury responsibility which
the delegation had been instruct-
ed to leave alone. As a general
Presidential assistant, I had au-
thority to negotiate a stabiliza-
tion agreement and I also had
Secretary Woodin's full con-
fidence. I had—and have—docu-
mentary proof of this which has
never been published.
These two concerns of the
conference, therefore, were mat-
ters in which I did have specific
rights.
The third concern of the for-
eign nations, described by Mr.
Hull, was tariff reform, with
which I had no concern. But as
Mr. Hull says, Mr. Roosevelt
had paralyzed this function by
refusing, after Mr. Hull was in
London, to ask Congress to en-
act a reciprocal agreement bill.
Thus, since the various na-
tions in London were confronted
with a delegation without pow-
er, it was not strange that they
anticipated my arrival with
some hope. I was unable to
fulfill this hope because after I
negotiated an agreement which
was completely within my writ-
ten instructions, the President,
for no good reason ever re-
vealed, rejected it. That rejec-
tion ended the conference. Since
that ended my mission, I re-
turned, made my report to the
President and left the govern-
ment to take up my duties as
a magazine editor.
Mr. Hull now fails to mention
that when I left the government
he made a public statement
that never at any time had he
"offered the slightest sugges-
tion to the President or to Mr.
Moley relative to any present or
future change of the official
status of the latter as Assistant
Secretary of State."
A minor point: Mr. Hull com-
plains further that I made a
radio speech on May 20 express-
ing some doubts about the con-
ference and that I did this with-
out his approval. That speech
was an exact prediction of the
difficulties that later appeared.
I was authorized to make that
speech by the President, who
had read and approved it.
And now, as far as I am con-
cerned, we can once more seal
the tomb and get on with living
and more important issues,
