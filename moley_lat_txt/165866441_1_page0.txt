Irresponsible war talk is seri-
ous enough in itself, but some
of it is now taking a turn which
is very dangerous indeed.
This writer enjoys neither ex-
pert knowledge nor inside infor-
mation on military plans. He is
content to let that be a monopo-
ly of the armed services. But he
is capable of appraising the sin-
ister effect on public opinion of
the writings and talk of the ama-
teurs who are telling us when,
where and in what manner we
are to meet and defeat Russia.
We are now hearing that we
can have "just a little war."
That has a familiar sound. A
famous commentator told us,
just before we arrived at Arma-
geddon seven years ago, that
our participation would be rela-
tively light. Just a little shoot-
ing in the Atlantic to keep our
supplies going smoothly to those
who would do our fighting for
us.
President Roosevelt himself
suggested the notion of a lim-
ited war in speeches in May
and September of 1941.
One of the very commentators
who is now talking about a
token war with Russia wrote,
some time before hostilities be-
gan, that Germany and the
United States could not have a
real war because they could not
get at each other. It was a case
of an elephant and a whale.
Wiser people pointed out that
war could not be limited by any-
one's choice, any more than a
little gas can be let out of a
toy balloon with a lighted
match.
The suggestion is made now
that only Napoleon and Hitler
tried a total decision with Rus-
sia. Presumably, the British and
French were wiser in the Cri-
mean War. But the Crimean
War was brought on by a literal
comedy of errors. Then, no vast
issue of European domination
was involved, as there is now.
The danger of talk about a
limited war deepens when we
consider that, while one side
may choose the time and place
for an attack, the other side may
have some ideas about places
and methods, too.
Amateur strategists are also
arranging the chessboard, on
the assumption that this or that
other nation will be on our side.
It would be wiser, however, if
amateurs insist upon planning
this war, to assume nothing
about allies.
We are already witnessing the
ghastly results of the uncondi-
tional surrender policy of Roose-
velt and Churchill. Goebbels re-
veals in his currently published
diary that the one thing he
feared most was an Allied decla-
ration against Nazism but not
against the German people.
Roosevelt, Churchill and, later,
that station wagon Hannibal,
Morgenthau, relieved Goebbels
of his worries and provided him
with unlimited propaganda ma-
terial.
If our pen-pushing strategists
would devote some attention to
the invention of ways toward
peace and let our expensive mili-
tary establishment worry about
the next war, they might make
a minor contribution. As it is,
they are deluding the public
with the idea that a war with
Soviet Russia can be fought by
token armies, with little cost and
under Marquis of Queensberry
rules. If war comes it will be
catastrophic, world-wide and un-
believably costly. That is all
that can safely be assumed.
