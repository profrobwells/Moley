Hurley's Senate Campaign
Has National Importance
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since New Mexico is one of
the two States where the Re-
publican Party has the best
chance to pick up sorely needed
Senate strength, there would be
national interest in the cam-
paign there in any event. But
with Maj. Gen. Patrick J. Hur-
ley running, there is not only
importance in the contest but
vitality, drama and intense con-
troversy. And the extraordinary
background of the State adds
still more spice to the show.
Hurley's life is a tremen-
dous story of adventure, contro-
versy and achievement. It cov-
ers three wars and public af-
fairs in the old Indian Territo-
ry, Oklahoma, New Mexico and
Washington. He has seen serv-
ice in at least three administra-
tions and under two party re-
gimes.
At an age when most men
think of retirement, he was as-
signed by President Roosevelt
to the hazardous task of run-
ning the Japanese blockade in
the Far East and was wounded
in action. Later, as a traveling
Ambassador, he had important
missions in many lands. He
vigorously defended his record
before the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, and it must be
added that his judgments ex-
pressed there have in general
been vindicated by subsequent
events.
Hurley's Democratic opponent
is former Secretary of Agricul-
ture Clinton Anderson, who is
no novice in politics and, if nor-
mal conditions prevailed, could
win in this normally Democrat-
ic State. But normal conditions
do not prevail this year.
Two years ago Hurley lost a
tremendous slugfest with Sen.
Dennis Chavez by a narrow
margin. Chavez won because
of his strong hold on the so-
called "native" population of
the State. He himself is a na-
tive. This year, while Ander-
son may be stronger among the
former Texans who are numer-
ous in the eastern part of the
State, Hurley will have a bigger
vote among the natives. And
his campaign will be directed at
those who supported Chavez
two years ago.
Issues will be of subordinate
importance. Hurley will make
it an adobe-to-adobe campaign.
He will shake thousands of sun-
browned hands. Already there
is evidence of desertions from
the Democratic party by sev-
eral vitally important native
leaders.
The Republican candidates,
especially Hurley, will receive
plenty of help from national
headquarters, for this small
State has immense significance
this year.
