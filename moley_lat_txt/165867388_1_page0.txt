RAYMOND MOLEY:
Campaign Began Too Early
and Already Is Too Long
The ironical thing about the
Dewey-Warren plea for unity is
that the more the plea is ac-
cepted, the less there is to talk
about. The end result of achiev-
ing peace and unity is complete
uniformity, and uniformity is
not exciting.
This campaign started too
early and is destined to last too
long. But there is nothing to do
about it. The candidates must
make appearances; their trains
must move: news must be print-
ed; and contributions must be
collected.
There has been no Presiden-
tial campaign like this for many
years. When Bryan used to run,
there was a showâ€”even though
the Great Commoner was al-
ways ticketed for defeat. When
T. R., Wilson or F. D. R. was
on the scene, there were color
and excitement. When Smith
ran against Hoover, 20 years
ago, he drew large crowds, al-
though everyone, except per-
haps Smith himself, knew he
had no chance.
PLAYING IT OUT
This year, those who must
write about politics, those who
must manage politics, those who
must keep on running for
President, and the public gen-
erally must look forward with
dismay at having to play out
the schedule when the outcome
is no longer in doubt. It is like
a pennant race in which one
team is 20 games ahead in July.
This unmistakable apathy is
mostly due to Dewey's great ad-
vantage. There is not only the
virtual certainty that Dewey
will be elected. There is the piti-
ful fact that Truman could not
do what he promises, even if he
were elected. The election of
Truman would be a mandate for
nothing. It would merely show
that the country agreed that the
80th Congress was bad. So
what? Repeal the Taft-Hartley
Act? Even so, that is no pro-
gram for a brave, newly re-
elected administration.
For all of Truman's trucu-
lence, he has not created the
impression of a man who, if
elected, would present an affirm-
ative program to the country.
He is against Wall Street and
reactionaries. But what would
he do about Wall Street and re-
actionaries if elected? Keep
them for the next election, pre-
sumably, as villains for his
play.
This is not because Truman
would have a hostile Congress.
It is because he would have
nothing much to suggest for
Congress to oppose. The public
realizes this, and its reaction is
total indifference.
The Wallace parade is dwin-
dling down to a vague, nonde-
script scattering of the perpet-
ually dissatisfied. While the
prospect of a Wallace vote in
the spring was about 5,000,000
and in early September had
dropped to 3,000,000, it is hard
now to see where he can get
2,000,000. There is no reality to
the Wallace protest. Few can
believe his charges and if they
did, they would still have no
reason to vote for him.
Dewey and Warren are the
beneficiaries of this frustrated
opposition. They are also its
victims. It leaves very little
to talk about. Unity and pros-
perity are all right for a while,
but as concepts they elicit no
enthusiasm. There is measur-
able unity at the heart of the
country, but it is like the at-
mosphere you breathe without
comment or reflection.
There are Senatorial races
which will come to life in a few
States, but they cannot stir the
whole country.
So let us reconcile ourselves
to a fairly dull period before the
election. The World's Series
helped for a while. And then
there will be football and au-
tumn walks.
