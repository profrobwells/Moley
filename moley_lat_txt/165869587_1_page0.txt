TAFT'S CHANCES.
While this writer has no pre-
dictions to make, he feels cer-
tain that the public greatly un-
derestimates Taft's chances in
the race for the nomination.
There are many reasons for this
neglect.
One reason is Taft's relatively
poor showing in the polls. An-
other is the fact that most Wash-
ington political writers are too
close to the trees to see the
woods. In a recent Newsweek
poll of 50 Washington corre-
spondents, only six believed Taft
would be nominated. The firm
belief that there will be a dead-
lock is shown by the fact that
28 of the 50 correspondents indi-
cated that Vandenberg would be
the nominee. This is a gross
overestimate of Vandenberg's
strength, even in case of a dead-
lock. A deadlock is possible but
not probable.
A careful check of everything
procurable regarding delegate
preferences shows Taft to be
quite strong. Dewey will have
more strength on the first ballot,
but Taft will be close behind on
the second or third. At this
writing a fairly conservative es-
timate gives Dewey about 300 on
the first ballot and Taft about
200. On the second ballot Taft
will gain more than Dewey. His
strength then will be about 350;
Dewey's nearly 400.
After that a great many fac-
tors will be operating, some of
which distinctly favor Taft. The
convention will be fluid, with
delegations deliberately divided
and ready to move wherever the
best chances seem to appear for
landing on the winning side.
At that point a heavy psycho-
logical factor will appear. Tru-
man's weakness is so obvious
that the convention will not be
forced to pick the most popular
candidate. Hence the poor show-
ing of Taft in the polls will be
ignored in political thinking.
The bugaboo created by sev-
eral political writers that if Taft
is nominated Eisenhower will
run against him is hardly cred-
ible. Taft is no isolationist, nor
is Eisenhower likely to change
his determination not to run.
Hence the delegates will feel
confident that Taft can win if
nominated.
An exceedingly important fac-
tor in the mind of the average
delegate-politician is "regular-
ity." He will ask himself which
of the two-Dewey or Taft-is
more "regular." Which one will
he more likely to listen to or-
ganization requests? Which one
will best remember his friends?
In this respect those who favor
Taft have a persuasive argu-
ment.
It is undoubtedly true that
By Raymond Moley
Dewey has been as "regular" as
Taft. Certainly Dewey has re-
sponded to the legitimate patron-
age requirements of the New
York Republicans. He has main-
tained harmony in his State
party. Ed Jaeckle, his early
manager, was set aside in 1944,
but he is back now and is ap-
parently happy. The loyalty of
Dewey's intimates has been re-
markable through the years.
However, it is argued that
politicians like Taft better than
they like Dewey. It is said that,
despite Taft's obvious intellec-
tualism, he has a warmer per-
sonality than Dewey. This, it is
argued, will swing the unat-
tached to Taft if he has a chance
to be nominated. And he cer-
tainly will have a chance-an ex-
cellent chance.
