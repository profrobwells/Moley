RAYMOND MOLEY:
Charles Beard Lived to See
Events Justify His Vision
It is ironical that the New
York Times in an editorial at
the death of Charles A. Beard
used as its own the word "re-
actionary" in describing the
Columbia University trustees of
1917. Beard himself used that
word against them when he re-
signed in protest 31 years ago.
On that subject the New York
Times as well as Time caught
up to the vision of a great man.
For when Beard resigned the
Times gleefully greeted the
news as "Columbia's deliver-
ance."
Columbia too lived and
learned. Almost every member
of Beard's former department
there, including this writer, is
a former student of that great
teacher and, it may be added,
warmly devoted to him. He
was induced nine years ago to
return for a short term of
teaching, and four years ago
the university conferred upon
him a lamentably delayed hon-
orary degree.
INTELLECTUAL LIBERTY
The incident 31 years ago
which provoked the resignation
of Beard was tacitly repudiated
by Columbia. That incident
was the summary dismissal of
two faculty members in the
heat of war psychology. It is
pretty clear that such an action
will not happen again. Beard
greatly contributed to that gain
for intellectual liberty.
After leaving Columbia Beard
moved into a wider field of vast
influence. Unquestionably he
influenced the social thinking
of his generation more than
any other man. Statesmen can
move into new lines of policy
only when they find the minds
of people conditioned to new
adventures in government.
Beard's texts flowed into every
range of education from the
grades to the graduate schools.
Advanced students of his be-
fore 1917 have attained high
place and influence, and all of
them, to my knowledge, are be-
lievers in Beard's thinking.
BEFORE PEARL HARBOR
Which raises the serious
question of Beard's more re-
cent views on the diplomatic
preliminaries of the war which
have been violently attacked by
many pro-Roosevelt reviewers.
Who can tell but in 30 years
Beard will not again be vindi-
cated.
His thesis is that the United
States blundered and vacillated
into Armageddon before Pearl
Harbor, and that at the moment
of crisis the failure of Kimmel
and Short stemmed from high-
er-up failures in Washington.
Beard's critics may remain on
earth longer than their target,
but the present course of cloudy
peace may not justify their
glib judgments.
Beard felt the need to lay
these facts before the world was
so great that he labored pas-
sionately at an advanced age to
bring them out. Two big books
were already published by him
on the subject, but he kept on.
Three weeks ago when this
writer saw him last he said
with a gleam of his old fire,
"There will be more, if I live."
There will be more all right,
despite the fact that Beard did
not live to write them himself.
