Oregon Is Politically Quiet;
Washington Has Contests
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This survey allowed two
days in Washington and one in
Oregon. That ratio represents
the relative interest of the po-
litical campaign in these two
States.
In Oregon there is scarcely
a contest. All is quiet after the
Dewey-Stassen show in May,
when this reporter last visited
the State. Traditional Re-
publicanism prevails after four
Roosevelt victories.
The four Congressmen will
be Republican, and the capable
Sen. Guy Cordon will succeed
himself. John Hall, who found
himself acting Governor after
a plane crash killed the Governor
and Lieutenant Governor,
lost in the primary and is now
in difficulties over some pur-
chases made by the Liquor
Commission. The successful
Republican nominee will be the
next Governor.
One of my days in Washing-
ton was primary day. No Sen-
atorship is on the line this year.
The present New Dealish Gov-
ernor, Mon Wallgren, Harry
Truman's friend and playmate,
won over a former Governor,
Clarence Martin, by a big mar-
gin. Martin is a conservative
Democrat, and some people in
conservative Eastern Washing-
ton thought he had a chance.
Republicans can vote for Dem-
ocrats in a Washington pri-
mary, and many probably did.
But the votes in the more
radical Seattle-Tacoma district
were overwhelmingly for Wall-
gren. Arthur Langlie, another
former Governor, won the Re-
publican nomination with ease.
A distinct sign that the State
might not be a sure thing for
Dewey is that the total Repub-
lican primary vote was not so
large as had been expected by
good observers in Seattle. This
was, in part, due to cross-vot-
ing for Martin, but there was
ominous Republican apathy, in
contrast to the vigorous out-
pouring of labor for anti-Taft-
Hartley candidates.
Five of the six Washington
Congressmen elected in 1946
were Republicans. Now the
party ratio of Congressmen
may be the same this year,
but in the 1st District which,
prior to 1946, was heavily
Democratic, Hugh Mitchell,
who had been Democratic Sen-
ator, won his party's nomina-
tion and will be hard to beat.
And so the Republican major-
ity in the House may be clipped
by one vote in Washington.
Washington is an excellent
place to study the Wallace
movement. When I was there
in May, it was predicted that
Wallace would get 12% of the
vote. The same good judges of
politics who said that doubt
now whether Wallace will get
10%. They say that after the
Philadelphia Wallace conven-
tion the movement noticeably
slipped.
The Communist support of
Wallace in the State has been
dragged into the open by a
State Committee on Un-Ameri-
can Activities, and its serious
import is recognized. Many of
the names mentioned in the
Thomas Committee hearings
were first brought out in the
State investigation in Washing-
ton. As the Communist blight
appears more vividly, the Pro-
gressive Party grows weaker
in Washington, as elsewhere.
