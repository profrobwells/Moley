RAYMOND MOLEY:
More Fiscal Moonshine
From President Truman
President Truman is distin-
guished for his loyalty to his
friends and advisers. But a point
comes when loyalty suggests
obtuseness that cannot be good
for the country. His blithe con-
fidence apparently still rests
with fiscal advisers who have
made him look silly three years
in a row.
Or can it be that some fancied
political advantage accounts for
his erroneous budget estimates?
For "fiscal 1947" (1946-1947)
he predicted a deficit of no less
than $4,500,000,000. There
proved to be a surplus of $800,-
000,000. For "fiscal 1948" he first
predicted a surplus of $200,000,-
000. In October he revised this
upward to about $4,600,000,000.
It turned out to be closer to
$8,000,000,000.
Now he forecasts for "fiscal
1949" a deficit of $1,500,000,000.
This is so grossly incorrect that
any casual reader can see the
error. There will probably be a
surplus of almost $3,000,000,000.
And it will be considerably high-
er if a Republican administra-
tion acts decisively after Jan.
20.
It may humbly be suggested
that the President's resources in
financial advice and information
are massive and overwhelming
compared with a person who
writes a column. But the econo-
mist, Dr. Julius Hirsch, who
advises this writer, enabled him
to question the President's fig-
ures these three years and to
attain a much higher degree of
accuracy. Early in 1946 this
column predicted a surplus, not
a deficit, for fiscal 1947. In 1947
I said that the surplus for fiscal
1948 would be $7,500,000,000 to
$8,000,000,000, which, before al-
lowing for the tax cut, is about
what it was. The present esti-
mate for fiscal 1949 speaks for
itself.
The principle that President
Truman and his advisers seem
to miss and that my economist
friend has steadily adhered to
is easy to state and to under-
stand. It is that so long as the
national income rises—be it by
real performance or by inflation
—the national expenditures can
never increase to the same de-
gree. As long as price inflation
continues, Federal income will
rise faster than expenditures.
This is the case now.
That principle applied to a
deflationary cycle means that
receipts fall far behind expendi-
tures.
The reason is, of course, that
so much of the Federal schedule
of expenditures is in fixed
amounts, salaries, interest and
the like.
The Senators and Representa-
tives who have attacked the
Truman estimate for fiscal 1949
are more correct than their ar-
guments. They are attacking the
President's figures from the
wrong angle. It is true as they
say that out of the huge surplus
of last year $3,000,000,000 has
been set aside to pay for ERP
deliveries, partly made in fiscal
1947. That, however, is not the
real fallacy. It would still leave
the suspicion that we might
sink into the red after the tax
cut because nothing for 1949
can be changed back to fiscal
1948.
But the already sharply in-
creased national income assures
a rise in revenue. It may be
added that none has boasted so
loudly of that big income as
did the President and Barkley
at Philadelphia.
