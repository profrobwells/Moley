Moley Views Platform
as Usual 'Double Talk'
BY RAYMOND MOLLEY
PHILADELPHIA, June 22—
In this cave of winds officially
known as the Republican Na-
tional Convention two subjects
are of interest on this second
day.
The first is the platform
which seems to please almost
everybody. The second is a
batch of rumors of deals that
please few and deceive only the
gullible.
The platform is no master-
piece despite Sen. Vandenberg's
praise of it. It is short and that
is good. It is pretty inclusive of
issues and that is good. But
in many respects it embodies
the same political double talk
that has become a tradition in
American politics.
Civil Rights Program
To illustrate. Every effort is
made to present the Republican
Party as the enemy of statism.
In fact, Joe Martin's keynote
is a denunciation of Statism.
The party is presented as op-
posed to controls, mainly, of
course, economic controls. But
in the case of a very special
concern, the Negro vote, the
platform is all stateism. The
whole Truman civil rights pro-
gram is included down to a
fair employment practices
commission. There is included
under civil rights anti-lynching
legislation, presumably Federal.
Abolition of poll tax is urged,
and segregation in the armed
forces is condemned.
Thus the party believes in
controls when votes are in-
volved, but opposes them when
the victims also have votes. And
since these controls are Federal
the party thus denies its brave
words about States' rights. But
all this is part of the game. The
rumors of deals may be clouds
that pass in the night. Thurs-
day's voting is what counts.
And all this talk may be for-
gotten then,
But this reporter, who has
written many words in this col-
umn in admiration of Harold
Stassen, deeply regrets some of
them. He regrets them chiefly
because he feels that Stassen
may have injured himself in the
past few days in ways that may
impair his influence for years
to come. To be blunt, Stassen
seems to be a little too anxious
to get something—anything—
and to get it now. It may be
added that other and nearer
friends of Stassen share this
view.
No possible tie can connect
Col. McCormick and Stassen
than a desire to win a near ob-
jective. With no desire unfairly
to suggest motives, a Taft-
Stassen ticket means victory
for McCormick's man and the
vice-presidency for Stassen. But
what of the differences in out-
look of Stassen and McCormick?
What of Stassen's idea of send-
ing 10% of our production
abroad and the Colonel's views
on the ERP? What of the many
editorials and cartoons on Stas-
sen in the Tribune?
Perhaps this is all a part of
the reported Taft-Stassen deal?
Did or did not Stassen say that
he would not run with Taft?
All these are questions that are
going to disturb the many
young people who have grown
to idolize Stassen in the past
three years.
