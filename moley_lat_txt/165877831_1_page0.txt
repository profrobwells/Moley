RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nobody Knows What
Price Action Will Do
After a week of bickering
over the President's anti-infla-
tion program in Congress, in
the press and over the radio,
the average citizen must be
thoroughly confused.
It should be explained that
nobody really knows what ef-
fect any action by government
will have on prices and condi-
tions as a whole. Not even ex-
perts know, and politicians can
only hope.
TRUMAN'S ROUND
Clearly, the President scored
something of a first-round vic-
tory in calling Congress, al-
though he deserves censure for
using his great emergency pow-
er for purely political ends. It
would be politically foolish for
the Republican high command
to do what some Republicans
have suggestedâ€”to toss every-
thing overboard and adjourn.
What are those measures and
what value will they have in
cutting prices without econom-
ic collapse?
Certainly, Congress will not
pass the roll-back, which of all
proposals is the most shoddy
political trick. A roll-back mere-
ly takes money from an al-
ready overburdened treasury
and gives it to sellers so that
they can sell goods below cost.
Certainly Congress will not
pass wartime price control or
rationing, because that would
compel most Republicans and
many Democrats in Congress
to stultify themselves. It would
be politically ruinous to them.
Also, price control must go all
the way. Partial control accom-
plishes nothing.
RATIONING MEAT
The President probably
meant meat when he suggested
rationing. But as soon as the
feed situation catches up with
meat production, there will be
relief anyhow. And if price con-
trol were to be imposed, meat
would not be put on the mar-
ket.
Regulation of commodity ex-
changes is a joke. Speculation
does not cause high prices.
Beyond all this, there is a
chance that the Republicans
may give the President a bit of
rope, some of which, they hope,
he will use as a halter for him-
self.
Authority to impose controls
on consumer credit may be re-
stored to the Federal Reserve
Board. This would have little
effect on the general economy,
since the total increase in con-
sumer credit since controls
were removed is less than
$1,000,000,000. This amount is
insignificant compared with the
increase in the national income.
Authority may be granted to
the Federal Reserve Board to
curb bank credit. This, how-
ever, is a hot poker, as was
shown in 1920 when conditions
were similar to those prevailing
today. The Federal Reserve
curbed credit then, and when
a depression came it was called
a Federal Reserve depression.
The agricultural bloc in Con-
gress was especially critical.
Probably Messrs. McCabe, Sny-
der and Truman are quite
aware of that history and for
that reason are somewhat hesi-
tant about curbing bank credit.
We may be certain that in
the weeks to come natural
forces will prevail, while poli-
tics will point with pride or
view with alarm.
