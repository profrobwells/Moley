RAYMOND MOLEY:
Open Season Declared
on Business Profits
No. 1 whipping boy for 1949
will be business profits. Anxious
to legislate reckless campaign
charges, Democratic leaders will
begin the attack in Congress.
Labor, with its old cost-of-living
argument slipping away, will
fall back on the argument of
excessive corporation profits.
Thus, a money-hungry adminis-
tration and wage-hungry labor
will hunt the same real or imag-
inary game.
Before this chase gets under
way, it may be well to examine
the reality of the so-called prof-
its.
It will be difficult in the face
of partisan statistics to explain
the facts of business life. Su-
perficially, profits seem to be
very large, because not every-
body is talking about the same
dollars. It is true that in gross
dollars business profits have
more than doubled since 1940.
PROFITS AND DIVIDENDS
But units of production have
increased two-thirds. And prof-
its measured in purchasing pow-
er are no higher. Labor claims
increases in line with purchas-
ing power but denies the same
equity for stockholders. What
is sauce for the goose is appar-
ently not sauce for the gander.
There are other equally im-
portant considerations.
Profits are not all used to pay
dividends. They are in consid-
erable part essential to the
preservation and renewal of
productive plants. All plant
buildings, machinery and the
like cost twice as much now as
they did in 1939. The deprecia-
tion rates allowed by the Treas-
ury in tax assessments have not
made allowance for this. But
if 10 years of depreciation at
10% would by 1949 reach 100%
of purchasing value, business
would need twice as much mon-
ey for replacements. Present
tax policies plus a new tax on
profits would tend to destroy
the nation's greatest assetâ€”its
productive plant.
WITHHOLDING DIVIDENDS
Moreover, if a commodity
bought three or four years ago
is now sold for more than it
cost, the difference is figured by
the Treasury as a profit. But
if the dealer tries to repurchase
the same commodities, he must
pay more. Here the Treasury
has admitted a measure of re-
lief. It permits the figuring of
inventories as if the last items
bought were the first sold. That
is, "last in, first out."
Corporations have avoided
bad consequences by another
expedient. They have made
price increases larger than cost
increases, but they have with-
held dividends and ploughed
back earnings into their busi-
nesses. Therefore, they have
more working capital. The rate
of earnings has been returned
at the old capital figure.
But this process of self-fi-
nancing will peter out. It is
contrary to the old principle of
a capitalistic economy. Under
that principle old capital should
be replaced fully by deprecia-
tions and recovered in prices,
with the remainder going to
stockholders: New capital should
be sought from the free capital
market, which is supplied by
the money saved by citizens of
all sorts.
FLEETING OPPORTUNITY
If government policy shuts
down on money ploughed back
and also checks the savings of
the people, the basis of our sys-
tem of opportunity will be eaten
away. Our ancestors were com-
mended for risking their sav-
ings in ventures for which they
expected, if successful, to get
good rewards. Today such sav-
ings are attacked at the source.
If this twofold attack of gov-
ernment and labor is successful,
capital will dry up and the gov-
ernment will be the only sup-
plier of capital. It is easy to see
that at the end of that road gov-
ernment will own business.
All these considerations must
be urged with increasing force
if the drive for new taxes and
new wage increases is to be
slowed down or stopped.
