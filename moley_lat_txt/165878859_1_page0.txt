What's to Be Warren's Place
in the New Administration?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
With President Truman
whirling into California and
Gov. Dewey in hot pursuit, the
campaign officially opened in
California. It had been quiet
until now.
Dewey advantage. The first
Gallup poll showed Dewey
leading Truman by more than
500,000 votes. The astute polit-
ical reporter, Kyle Palmer,
made the comment in the Los
Angeles Times that this pros-
pect was likely to be heady and
dangerous wine for Republi-
cans. It was likely to lead to
overconfidence.
California is a changeable
State.
While Truman and Dewey
were invading California, War-
ren is moving east. The Cali-
fornia candidate for Vice-Pres-
ident will return in October to
spend the last two weeks of
the campaign stumping his
home State.
There is a great deal of
State pride in the Warren can-
didacy and much speculation
about what Warren will do
when he takes over his office as
Vice-President in Washington.
There is, moreover, speculation
in California and elsewhere
about what duties can be given
to an active Vice-President.
When Warren was nominated
at Philadelphia, enthusiasts
said that he would become a
sort of deputy President and
that Dewey had made assur-
ances that Warren would not
be expected to rust away in
the Vice-President's chair.
Neither of those comments
was justified by the facts.
The Vice-President is de-
scribed in the Constitution as
a legislative officer until the
time when he assumes the du-
ties abandoned by the Presi-
dent. He can meet with the
Cabinet, tactfully work with
Congress in behalf of legisla-
tion, make speeches and repre-
sent the nation on occasions at
home and abroad. But the as-
sumption of authority in ad-
ministrative matters would in-
volve the danger of clashes
with department heads and
others.
Warren has become an in-
stitution in California, and
there is much interest in what
will happen in the Governor's
office after he leaves. The pro-
spective and present acting
Governor, Goodwin J. Knight,
prior to his election as Lieu-
tenant Governor two years ago,
was a well-known and popu-
lar State judge. He is a good
speaker, personable and able.
He has been more clearly iden-
tified with the Republican Par-
ty as such than Warren, who
was always more or less of an
independent. Knight will have
plenty to do to fill Warren's
place in the State and to win
the election two years hence.
And he is well aware of that
fact.
