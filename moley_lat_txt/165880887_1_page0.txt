President's Plans May
Not Match Promises
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Whether the warm sun of
Florida, in which President Tru-
man is resting, will sprout com-
prehensive plans for next year
will probably depend on his
companions. So far, the pros-
pect is that rest, mutual felici-
tation and patronage will fill
the agenda. Heavy thinkers
are absent. Perhaps they are
busy with plans in Washington.
Those who are with the Presi-
dent now are mostly campaign
companions and other favorites.
Those who assisted him in
the campaign, of course, know
what he promised. But promises
are not plans. And the pro-
posals which the President will
submit to Congress may differ
in a marked way from the
points he made in his speeches.
Before Mr. Truman launches
himself into the constructive
matters of his new term, he will
have to know a good deal about
business prospects. That means
dependence on his Council of
Economic Advisers. He will
have to consider his budget, in
consultation with his director
and department heads, espe-
cially those of the Defense De-
partment. Taxes call for Secre-
tary Snyder, Sen. George, Con-
gressman Doughton and trusted
members of the Federal Reserve
Board. Price control would
call for Paul Porter, who would
probably head up any new price-
control setup.
The President, however, is
morally and politically commit-
ted to his legislative program
of last July. That committed
him to an excess profits tax,
consumer credit controls, re-
strictions on commodity specu-
lation, rent controls and alloca-
tion, rationing and price con-
trols on scarce commodities.
He got his way with credit
controls. Speculation in com-
modities is unpopular when
prices are going up, but now
that the price tide has turned,
we shall probably hear no more
of that. A gesture toward
restoring excess profits taxation
may be made. But with Dough-
ton and George on guard, we
may expect that a real need will
have to be demonstrated for
new taxes before much more
than nominal excess profits
rates will pass. And if the na-
tional income does not measur-
ably drop in the next few
months, present taxes will prob-
ably keep us in the blackâ€”pro-
vided, of course, that there are
no drastic increases in military
expenditures, health insurance
and Social Security coverage.
That leaves allocation, ration-
ing and price control on scarce
commodities. This will be a
crucial problem in the next
Congress. Its discussion will
probably begin with the intro-
duction of measures to give the
President certain stand-by pow-
ers. This will precipitate debate,
and the outcome may well de-
pend on what natural forces do
to prices in the next few months.
The one thing which business
leaders and others interested in
the size of the budget antici-
pate is a creeping increase in
government spending for all
sorts of direct benefits to groups
and public works. This is a real
danger, because such spending
will be actively pressed by all
elements which helped Mr. Tru-
man win the election.
