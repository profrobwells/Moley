Voters Liked Straight Talk
Better Than Ghost Speeches
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Of all the afterthoughts on
the election, the one which
probably carries the most validity is that Truman's speeches
won more converts than did
Dewey's. The underlying reason for this should be pondered
by all statesmen, would-be
statesmen and young people
who hope to be statesmen.
The ghost-written speech has
reached a stage of refinement
where it either must be greatly
improved or go out of business
completely. The great common
sense of the public has decreed
it, and this popular judgment
is a wholesome thing for us all.
NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS
For many years it has been a
growing practice for public
men to depend on more or less
expert help in preparing
speeches. Only men like T. R.
and Woodrow Wilson tailored
their own utterances. This was
possible because long before
they became national figures
they were professional writers.
Moreover, T. R. and Wilson
were both speakers who, on
occasion, could talk directly and
without manuscript.
In recent years—especially in
the F. D. R. era—the practice
of elaborate speech preparation was accepted as a matter
of course in politics, in business and in many other fields.
No moral stigma was attached
to a man's reading a speech
largely prepared by others. The
demands upon men's time, their
unfamiliarity with literary expression and the danger of
factual errors seemed to require
such expert help.
CYNICAL CHARLIE
The practice was so cynically
accepted by "ghosts" that
speeches were dashed off in
mass production without even
a thought of the person who
might deliver them. The late
Charles Michelson, working for
the Democratic National Committee, would write a speech
first, and decide later which
Senator or Cabinet member
would have the chore of delivering it. The result was hardly
inspiring, but it filled radio
time and it sufficed to keep
party spirit alive.
Beginning with the campaign
of 1936, the successive Republican candidates elaborately developed the practice of multiple
assistance in preparing campaign speeches. Such organized
speech writing reached its dizzy
climax in the campaign just
concluded. A very considerable
staff was assembled which accompanied the candidate on his
travels. There were experts for
nearly every pertinent issue—
labor, agriculture, finance, foreign affairs, etc., etc. There
was a specialist on idealistic
and religious homilies.
DEWEY IN OREGON
The result was that too many
cooks produced a broth which
had no savor. Certainly the
speeches did not represent the
true Dewey personality, which
came out splendidly in Oregon
in May when, fortunately, he
was far from a brain trust and
had to talk straight from his
mind and conscience.
Al Smith's practice of talking
from a few notes on the back
of an envelope was best. The
"ghost" must reform himself or
pass into thin air.
