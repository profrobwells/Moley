RAYMOND MOLEY:
Time Is on Our Side
in the Russian Duel
The hopes and fears of those
who look beyond immediate
stresses and strains in our rela-
tions with the Soviet govern-
ment to the long range prospect
of peace depend upon one ques-
tion.
Do all these conflicts on the
vast periphery of Soviet Rus-
sia—Berlin, Trieste, Greece,
Turkey, Austria, Korea and
China—constitute a closely knit
pattern of Soviet ambition?
The answer is that the pres-
ent rulers in the Politburo
probably do see and operate
on the basis of such a pattern.
They probably also believe that
ultimately they will fight for
the integrity of that pattern
when and if they believe they
can win. The fixed purpose of
the Politburo may be as defi-
nite a plan of conquest as that
revealed by the Nazis in the
Nuremberg trials. Let us as-
sume this and keep our powder
dry so that such an eventuality
may be met when and if it oc-
curs.
ALL MUST PASS
But as we assume this let
us keep in mind another fact:
These present rulers are hu-
man beings. They die and they
are subject to internal quarrels
and conflicting ambitions.
The policies of a great nation
are not fixed in unchanging pat-
terns. New men come to the
top and the ideas and plans of
those men are determined by
external circumstances. In this
case those ideas and plans will
be conditioned by the relative
advantages of a prosperous
Russia as against foreign con-
quest, by the strength of the
Communist principle as it
works out in the economy of
the world, by the rapidity with
which the rest of the world can
recover strength and prosper-
ity, and, what is most impor-
tant, by the advantage to Rus-
sia of trade relations with that
world.
The wisest of those who are
directing foreign policy for the
western powers no doubt are
keeping this future eventuality
in mind. They are working to
provide not only safety for
themselves but to prove to
these and future rulers of the
Soviet that world Communist
expansion is not only a futile
purpose but that it cannot help
Russia.
Against this long range pros-
pect the present situation in
Berlin and in all of Germany
offers some evidences of hope.
The ultimate objectives of west-
ern policy are slowly being
reached.
The Berlin crisis, however
dangerous, was created by these
very gains. The introduction
of the new western currency
forced the Russians to adopt
the very clumsy expedient of
the blockade. The Russians
badly needed the products of
the industry of Berlin’s west-
ern zone. They needed them
not only for their own zone
but for Poland and other areas
under their control. Their own
German currency was effective-
ly counterfeited and lost the
confidence of Germans. The
blocking of bank accounts by
the Russians proved to be a
boomerang because it hampered
the production of German goods
which the Russians needed and
the western powers did not
need.
The whole imbroglio proved
that while the Russians sorely
needed the Germans they could
not gain their confidence and
co-operation.
TWO OBJECTIVES
In the wider field of German
affairs the Russians are still
intent upon two objectives, and
these also may end in frustra-
tion. They want indemnities
which could hardly be wrung
from Germany even with the as-
sent of the western powers.
They want a hand in the con-
trol of the Ruhr. But the long-
er they are denied that con-
trol the faster the Germans
will re-establish the Ruhr in-
dustry and the more difficult
it will be to rearrange new ele-
ments of control.
In short, the western way of
life is winning its race with
Communism. If an accidental
precipitation of war can be
avoided the idea of world con-
quest will be poor fare for
future political rulers of Rus-
sia to offer their people. This
is the hope of our policy. To
realize it requires not only
steady nerves but more and
more efficient hands.
