Ruhr Coal Nationalization
May Be Only a Beginning
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last month the German State
of North Rhine, Westphalia,
adopted a law nationalizing
the coal mines of the Ruhr. The
preamble of the law says that
the Diet "enacts this law as a
trustee of the rights of the Ger-
man nation and without preju-
dice to later uniform legisla-
tion within the framework of
the German economy as a
whole."
The law assigns all mines of
bituminous coal and lignite to
a "self-administrationâ€”coal," a
public corporation governed
by a council of members elected
by the Diet. Ten of the 33 mem-
bers are to be members of the
Diet, 10 from labor unions, 5
representatives of the industry,
and the rest from scattered in-
terests. Thus labor is well es-
tablished in control.
MINE EFFICIENCY
Indemnity to former owners
is to be fixed by a special law,
but war criminals and "activ-
ist Nazis" are to be excluded.
A large share of the mines
whose estimated value is a bil-
lion dollars was owned by big
companies such as Thyssen,
Krupp, Flick, and Farben.
There seems to have been no
political division on the prin-
ciple of nationalization. Dif-
ferences were in details.
The Ruhr mines under pri-
vate ownership were brought to
a state of great efficiency. The
British who saw the mines after
Hitler's fall sadly admitted that
they were, even in their dam-
aged condition, better equipped
than those of Britain.
No doubt the Germans, while
fundamentally preferring pri-
vate ownership, were moved to
nationalization because of fear
that foreign capital would take
over the mines.
FURTHER SOCIALISM.
It is difficult to see how this
act will solve the larger prob-
lem of the Ruhr industry. Coal
production is intimately tied
into the steel and chemical in-
dustries. Altogether the Ruhr
comprises the most complex in-
dustrial system in the world.
The probable reaction of the
Allies will be mixed. The
French ardently want to pre-
vent the reconstruction of an
industry that can make war.
The British government can
hardly actively object to na-
tionalization since it is already
in that business itself. But it
also must think of the devas-
tating competition of an efficient
German industry in the mar-
kets of the world. The Rus-
sians will favor anything that
permits them to get a piece of
reparations.
American taxpayers cannot
object to an outcome that per-
mits Germany to work for ex-
port and thus lighten the bur-
den on us. But our military
people will fear a new war, and
political and the left-wing ad-
visers of our occupation are
probably very happy at this
step toward Socialism and this
large gain for labor.
A general adjustment of all
these interests can be made
by supervision that provides
efficient production with ade-
quate safeguards against re-
armament.
Nationalization, however, may
continue. Coal is essential to
steel production and the vast
uses of coal tar in chemistry
suggest a tie-in with the chem-
ical industry. These may well
follow coal into state owner-
ship
