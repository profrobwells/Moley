Wasteful Ways
of U.S. Hiring
Are Uncovered
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Hoover Commission on
Organization of the Executive
Branch of the Government is
hesitant about exact estimates
of economy. But John Stevenson,
president of the Penn Mutual
Life Insurance Co. and head
of the Hoover task force on Federal
personnel, estimates that
$600,000,000 can be saved
through proper hiring and firing
practices.
The Stevenson study revealed
a large number of amazing facts
about Federal employment. We
have all been informed and disturbed
about the huge increase in Federal
jobs. In 25 years Federal
employment grew from
570,000 to a peak of 3,700,000 in
1945. It is now 2,100,000.
LESS FOR MORE
But this is not the most serious
part of the matter. We are
getting less and less service for
our money. The turnover in
Federal employment is appallingly
high. Since the end of the
war the government has lost
3,900,000 employees and has
hired 2,800,000. This means a
total of 6,700,000 "personnel
movements," which, of course,
involve vast paper work, movements
of men, women and families and
great expense both to those people
and to the government.
It is estimated by former Civil
Service Commissioner Fleming
that the turnover in Federal
jobs is 500,000 a yearâ€”
nearly one in four. This means
3% a month.
INCOMPETENTS' HAVEN
The rate of turnover is so
heavy and fast that normal Civil
Service operations fall far behind.
When the rigmarole of
advertising, competitive examinations
and so forth cannot be
applied, people are appointed on
a temporary basis. Fifteen thousand
a month receive such temporary
appointments.
Because getting rid of incompetents
is such a long and painful
process, very few of these
departures are forced. The incompetents
stay. The ambitious
leave. The great majority of
those who leave the service do
so because they are dissatisfied.
Half of those who stated
their reasons for leaving said
they left because of low pay.
And after they had left, 71%
reported that they were getting
more than they had received
from the government.
A POOR CAREER
Federal employment is thus
regarded by those who have
sampled it as a poor sort of
career.
All of this has been apparent
for some years and, as always
in government, "scientific"
means have been employed to
discover the cause and apply
a cure. But, ironically, the
means employed to help have
simply added new expense
while things were getting
worse.
"Personnel management" as a
direct service was not known
as a separate activity in most
departments 10 years ago. But
beginning at that time, the
government began hiring experts
in "personnel management."
The salary cost of such
specialists has increased six-
fold since 1940. The Budget
Bureau reports that 23,430 people
are engaged in personnel
work at a cost of $76,000,000 a
year. That this service has
hardly paid its way is shown
by the steady deterioration already
mentioned.
OUTMODED SYSTEM
The cure must be much more
fundamental than the mere employment
of personnel specialists.
Employment must be decentralized.
Each department must
run its employment, subject to
standards and auditing by the
Civil Service Commission. Merely
to increase salaries will not
suffice. The laws regulating removals
must be changed. And
lines of authority must be simplified.
The old spoils system was
wasteful, but the cure has become
almost as bad.
