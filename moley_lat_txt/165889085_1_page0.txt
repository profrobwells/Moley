What It's Going to Mean
to Prepare for War
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The meeting of the American
Economic Association and re-
lated groups last week in Cleve-
land devoted major attention
to two topics—the economic
outlook for 1949 and prepared-
ness for war. Academic and
technical people as well as
responsible government officials
participated. Talk was frank
and highly informative.
As these open meetings were
observed in perspective, a pow-
erful reflection was induced.
Why should the Russians or
anyone else from abroad spend
money and risk exposure by
espionage? The vital facts
about our country are open to
any observer. Spying on a
free country is like paying for
the right to breathe. Every-
where the facts about our fac-
tories, offices and homes are
to be had for the asking. Stalin
could learn every essential
about our preparedness
through one trained listener.
NO CHEER FOR STALIN
Perhaps if Stalin listened in
at the Cleveland meetings his
attitude might change. For
there was little in what was
revealed to nourish his hope
for a depression in America.
And the simple facts about our
present and potential power
dwarf his own grandiose plans.
There seemed to be little
doubt at these meetings about
the end of our postwar boom.
It is rapidly subsiding. No
sharp decline is anticipated ex-
cept in a few business seg-
ments. Profits, the speakers
believed, would decline in 1949.
Taxes may be higher. And
general employment will be re-
tarded because of a number of
soft spots.
However, the discussions of
military preparedness revealed
no decline in our “armament
economy.”
ON PREPAREDNESS
The main speakers, although
differing in detail, revealed the
following line of thought:
The first phase of prepared-
ness, in which we are now
moving, is at the rate of $15,-
000,000,000 a year. Its impact
is mainly financial.
The second phase will move
to the gathering in of all raw
materials that the most imag-
inative military minds can dis-
cover. This will involve large
“set-aside” orders and a kind
of allocation of future war
plants in line with the loca-
tion of labor supplies suitable
for war purposes. One official—
a hopeless optimist—suggested
that a financial surplus should
be set aside in the Federal
budget for military purposes.
The third phase envisaged
would be the imminent danger
of war and would involve al-
locations, rationing and price
control.
DEFICITS AGAIN
Many tentative figures were
suggested. For the second
phase mentioned above an an-
nual $20,000,000,000 was esti-
mated. This, according to one
speaker, would mean a budget
deficit of $2,000,000,000. An-
other said the deficit might be
as high as $17,500,000,000.
The spokesmen for prepared-
ness viewed prospective civil
declines and unemployment
with great satisfaction. That,
they argued, would make it
easier for the armament side
of the economy to get supplies
and labor.
All these opinions and prog-
nostications raise the question
of what we are preparing for.
What is the situation of Rus-
sia, our prospective antagonist?
The best figure we can get on
Russia’s 1939 purchasing pow-
er is $30,000,000,000 to $35,000,-
000,000, or about half of our
income then and a fourth of
our income now.
THE RECKONING
We lack figures on Russia’s
present income, but we do
know that the ravages of war
are far from being repaired. If
we must set aside 10% of our
product for war, Russia, in or-
der to match us, would have
to earmark 35% of hers.
This race with a highly con-
tingent danger and a highly
doubtful antagonist entails an
arresting thought. Our arma-
ment—like the rusty equipment
left in foreign fields and the
exploded shells all over the
world—is lost to the produc-
tive uses of Americans. Such
basic losses in all past wars
have ultimately brought a reck-
oning in deep depression. Our
reckoning may be years away,
but it is something for econo-
mists to consider beyond their
present calculations.
