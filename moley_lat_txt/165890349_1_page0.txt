Exporting the New Deal
to Japan and Germany
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two weeks ago this column
discussed the dangers involved
in the "deconcentration" of Jap-
anese industry under the guid-
ance of inexperienced but zeal-
ous New Deal lawyers and
economists.
These reformers were mostly
sent out from the State Depart-
ment to work under generals
and colonels whose experience
in military affairs hardly fits
them to detect what their
subordinates are doing to in-
dustry. If unchecked this pol-
icy will paralyze Japanese re-
covery and put great power
into the hands of labor unions
plentifully permeated by Com-
munism.
There is more to be said about
this process of using Japan as a
guinea pig for New Deal ideas,
never really put over here and
entirely without standing as a
national policy.
But it ought to be noted that
much the same thing is being
done in Germany under the in-
spiration of New Dealers of the
same school of thought.
MORGENTHAU PATTERN
In Japan it is "deconcentra-
tion." In Germany it is "de-
cartelization." These two long
words mean the same thing, of
course.
The main legal instrument
used to atomize German indus-
try is Military Law 56. It fol-
lows the same economic philoso-
phy as the directives appearing
in Japan. Its danger to real re-
covery is equally great.
A wise and experienced
American who has recently
spent several months in Ger-
many writes that it is a won-
der we have any friends left
among German businessmen.
We are, he says, following the
famous Morgenthau pattern
with sufficient definiteness to
make it difficult, if not impos-
sible, for German industry to
take its place in real European
recovery. Communists are get-
ting into the labor organiza-
tions and managers who were
not real Nazis are being driven
out of positions for which their
experience is indispensable.
All this is happening while
we have a plan to raise the
level of German industry, in-
crease its exports in order to
pay for essential imports and
thus to ease the burden on the
American taxpayer. We are
having to send machine tools to
replace German tools sent to
other nations.
The theory of atomizing Ger-
man and Japanese industry is
based upon the assumption that
business interests in both coun-
tries were major factors in
bringing on the war. War in
both countries was promoted
by military and political fa-
natics. Business in both cases
was the tool and instrument of
military and political power.
The idea that atomizing in-
dustry can prevent another war
is wholly unproved. Atomiza-
tion of industry in such nations
merely makes them so weak
that our support will have to
be endless.
This consideration means
nothing to the break-up-busi-
ness school of the New Deal.
These people would have done
the same thing here if they
could have gotten away with it.
One of the leaders of the group
asserted a few years ago that
the automotive industry should
be broken up. When asked how
big his pieces would be he
named one of the smaller com-
panies.
The fact is that while the
company named is one of the
fine factors in the industry it
would itself regret to see its
big competitors broken up.
Moreover, these atomizers al-
ways fail to face the fact that
to break up industry into units
of a specific size and to keep
them so would require iron
regimentation by government.
That, however, is what is be-
ing attempted in Germany and
Japan.
