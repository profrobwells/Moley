The Oregon Trail
In this exciting week in Ore-
gon some local people are ask-
ing why their State has become
the center of political interest
in this big country.
The crop of delegates to be
selected is not so large. Twelve
is a small portion of 1100. Nine-
teen were selected in neighbor-
ing Washington at a convention
during all the Oregon furor, and
there was hardly a word about
it in the papers. And all over
the country hundreds of dele-
gates have been picked with less
fanfare.
One reason for the intense in-
terest in Oregon is the melan-
choly fact that this is the last
chance John Q. Public is going
to have to vote directly for a
Presidential candidate until No-
vember. Another and more im-
portant reason is that this pri-
mary means so much to the two
young men who are running.
Defeat will not kill the chances
of either, but a loss here will
be a real setback in prestige,
which will weigh heavily in the
minds of vacillating and unin-
structed delegates in other
States.
Oregon has not seen the like
of this for many, many years.
Towns and cities are full of po-
litical advertising, noisy head-
quarters and street-corner argu-
ments. The air, night and day,
is full of political broadcasts.
Everybody is enjoying it but the
weary and haggard managers
who have had to do a year's or-
ganizing in three or four weeks.
Even the candidates seem to
be having a good time. The
physical strain is terrific. It is
a good thing that they are young
and sound. This is no game for
an elder statesman. Both candi-
dates travel mostly in busses. No
town is too small for a stop.
Someone remarked of Dewey
that the uses of adversity are
sweet. The Wisconsin and Ne-
braska defeats have brought out
qualities in the man which have
seldom been seen before. He is
a happy warrior, virile, affable,
lively, concise and at times elo-
quent. He ducks no questions.
The harder they come the faster
he answers. And it should be
remarked that Dewey has made
an extraordinary impression.
Six months ago, all good po-
litical judges regarded Dewey as
the leading choice of Oregon Re-

publicans. Then came the Stas-
sen hurricane. Two months ago
it looked like Stassen was a 3-1
favorite. The counterattack by
Dewey has made a basic change
in those opinions. Reporters
who are personally favorable to
Stassen or some other candidate
all admit that the chances now,
a few days before the primary,
are about even. Those who like
Dewey believe he has a much
better than even chance to win.
The fact is that Dewey's cam-
paign has reversed a trend and
that the trend is now in his
favor and is continuing.
The outlaw-Communism issue
is not a particularly happy one.
Both candidates seem to have
blundered into it, and now they
have to keep it up. Because it
is a complicated legal problem,
it is not a good subject for po-
litical debate. And under our
Constitution it is really a State
issue. Many people would like
to hear more pertinent issues
discussed.
But in a campaign like this it
is the personal attractiveness of
the candidates that counts. And
both are showing real political
color,
