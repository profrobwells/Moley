Roosevelt and Rogers
Offer Sharp Contrast
Views of These Sons of Famous Men Vary
on Keeping Pledges, Raymond Moley Finds
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
PHILADELPHIA, July 12 —
The sons of two famous fathers
have contributed no little heat
to the continuous battle within
the California delegation here—
a battle which began even before
they left the home State.
Will Rogers Jr., whose political
views range well left of
center, has a firm belief that
promises should be kept, even
in politics. James Roosevelt
blithely abandoned a pledge to
support President Truman and
chased after the Eisenhower
phantom. He is back with Truman
again, but apparently only
because there is nowhere else
to go.
Feelings Are Bitter
There are bitter feelings in
the California delegation about
Roosevelt’s defection. At a glorious
linen-washing session on
Saturday, Roosevelt’s action was
characterized as a disgrace. A
motion to drop the late President’s
son as California national
committeeman was tabled.
Perhaps the motion was
dropped on the ground that two
wrongs do not make one right.
Roosevelt was pledged to support
Truman from the beginning; the
delegation had committed
itself to make him national
committeeman. As one
delegate put it: “We, at least,
will live up to our commitment.”
Rogers holds no bitter feelings
about Roosevelt. He has often
in the past gone out of his way
to be kind to his colleague delegate.
But he feels strongly that
Roosevelt in supporting the
Eisenhower drive was violating
a solemn pledge.
Resemblance Is Strong
This son of Will Rogers bears
a strong resemblance to his father
in a fundamental respect.
His countenance has little of
the ruggedness of the cowboy
humorist. He never tries to ape
his father’s mannerisms. His
views as a Congressman and as
an unsuccessful candidate for
the Senate in 1946 had little to
do with his father’s philosophy.
But in the present issue there is
plainly to be seen the intellectual
honesty that so endeared
Will Rogers Sr. to the people of
this country.
Under the California law, delegates
are selected at a primary,
and they are pledged to a candidate.
The law prescribes the
wording of the pledge. In this
case, it read as follows: “I personally
prefer Harry S. Truman
as nominee of my political party
for President of the United
States, and hereby declare to
the voters of my party in the
State of California that, if elected
as delegate to their national
party convention, I shall, to the
best of my judgment, and ability,
support Harry S. Truman as
nominee of my party for President
of the United States. And
I hereby enroll myself in the expression
of preference for Harry
S. Truman, Presidential nominee,
as one of the group of the
following named candidates for
delegate.”
This pledge was duly subscribed
to by Roosevelt and the
others on Feb. 24, 1948. The slate
of Truman delegates was elected
at the California primary.
When the movement to drop
Truman gained momentum,
Roosevelt joined in. He may
rationalize his action as a desire
to have Truman release his delegates
from their pledges and
withdraw from the race. And
he may say that, when Truman
failed to withdraw, he was prepared
to vote for him in the convention.
The brief but active Eisenhower
courtship, however, was a
strange way to “support” Harry
S. Truman “to the best of my
judgment and ability.”
No such pledge was violated
by those southern delegates who
have publicly opposed Truman.
Mr. Roosevelt has attained a
somewhat unenviable distinction
in this strange convention.
