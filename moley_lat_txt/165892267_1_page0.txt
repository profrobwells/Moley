RAYMOND MOLEY:
Tito Is Only One Sign
That Moscow Isn't Well
Whether the Iron Curtain is
to become a Venetian blind re-
mains to be seen. What can be
seen now and what has been
seen by some people for a long
time is that nationalism is
stronger than any ideology.
There can be a Communist
Party in Yugoslavia and it can,
in effect, be the government of
that country. But the country
remains more Yugoslav than
Communist. The same goes for
all the satellites of Russia. And
among Western European
countries, the Communist par-
ties can never rule in the strict
interest of Moscow, even if they
attain a majority. In this fact
is the hope that no internation-
al Communist movement can
really conquer Europe.
An additional sign that all is
not well among the satellites is
the news that Stalin has re-
duced the reparation debts of
Rumania and Hungary by one-
half. They have now paid two
or two and a half installments
of the annual $50,000,000 due—
mostly in commodities. Thus,
the Soviet government has
learned that it cannot have
these countries as brothers-in-
arms and also treat them as de-
feated enemies.
HALF OF WHAT?
An additional Soviet move is
almost absurd. The Russians
have made it known to the Ger-
mans that they will reduce the
reparations of their sector of
Germany by one-half. Since
those reparations have never
been fixed, this means half of
an unknown amount. As a mat-
ter of fact, it is just about half
of nothing.
This fraudulent concession to
Germany seems to have been
made because great expecta-
tions have been raised to the
effect that the eastern frontier
of Germany might be revised.
While the puppet Foreign Min-
isters were meeting in Moscow,
the German Communist press
was agitating for frontier
changes in favor of Germany.
But the eight countries decided
to end such talk for good and
declared that the Oder-Neisse
Line is to be permanent. The
reparations declaration is in-
tended to soften this blow to
the Germans.
The Yugoslav-Moscow tiff has
brought various interpretations
from official sources in Wash-
ington. Some of these indicate
great hope that the happy Com-
munist family is breaking up.
Others warn us not to expect
too much. It is apparent, how-
ever, that our State Department
was not ready for the break.
This is undoubtedly due to a
failure, once more, in our offi-
cial intelligence service. (See
Hanson W. Baldwin’s article on
this subject on the opposite
page.—Ed.)
It has been reliably reported
that U.S. Ambassador Caven-
dish Cannon had suspicions that
all was not well in Tito-Moscow
relations, but was caught com-
pletely off base by the sudden
explosion. He was apparently
visiting in Lisbon when the
thing happened.
It has been significant that
Gov. Dewey in several speeches
in the last two months has been
sharply critical of our various
intelligence services. Dewey is
not a man to make reckless and
unfounded charges. And his
long training has made him
sensitive to and expert in mat-
ters relating to intelligence
services. The improvement of
our knowledge of what is going
on abroad may well be a first
fruit of a new administration.
