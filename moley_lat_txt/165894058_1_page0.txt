Last Roundup by Moley:
GOP Will Keep the Senate
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While the business of this
column is not prediction, it may
be of interest to record on the
eve of the election a few personal
conclusions. These are
based on nation-wide travels,
with stopover visits in almost
every State in which any doubt
exists about the outcome of the
national election.
It is easy to predict the election
of Gov. Dewey. The confident
tone of President Truman
and his attacks on polls
can be discounted. There can be
no doubt about the outcome.
Last-minute checks indicate a
progressively increasing sweep
for Dewey and Warren.
Dewey's popular majority
will run beyond most predictions,
even beyond the 3,000,000
guess of Manager Herbert
Brownell. It will be nearer
5,000,000.
Wallace will be lucky to get
2,000,000 votes.
In the Electoral College,
Thurmond will receive a maximum
of 40 votes; Truman, a
maximum of 115; Dewey, a
minimum of 375.
In the House there are now
243 Republicans, with a few
vacancies. It is reasonable to
suppose, with a Dewey electoral
sweep, that this number will
rise, perhaps to 260.
In the Senate, a last-minute
survey makes it clear that the
obstacles now in sight make
Democratic control almost impossible.
If the four States, Oklahoma,
Minnesota, Wyoming and
West Virginia—in which Democrats
have seemed to have a
good chance to unseat Republicans—are
given to the Democrats,
their minority would rise
to a bare majority of 49.
But even if, on the morning
after election, they seem to
have elected that number, their
control would be doubtful. For
it is almost certain that Johnson
of Texas would be barred until
his qualifications have been determined.
That would bring the
vote to 48-47.
If it is impossible to bring
Sen. Wagner to Washington because
of his precarious health,
and that is likely, the Democratic
vote would sink to 47—provided,
of course, that all Republicans
stay alive and well
enough to appear. In case of a
tie, the old organization holds
over, and Warren will arrive on
Jan. 20 with another vote.
But giving the Democrats four
Republican seats and the two or
three doubtful Democratic seats
represents the maximum of
Democratic optimism. It gives
the Democrats all seats which
now look very close. Those
States are Wyoming, West Virginia,
Montana and New Mexico.
There is also some doubt
about Tennessee.
With a Dewey landslide, it
is hard to believe that the Democrats
could carry all these
five doubtful and semidoubtful
States.
This reporter would not be
surprised if 51 Republicans appear
in the new Senate, with
only 44 Democrats answering to
the first roll call.
