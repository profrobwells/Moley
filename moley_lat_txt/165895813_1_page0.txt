RAYMOND MOLEY:
Attempt of New Dealers
to Socialize Japanese
The chief of the finance and
trade section of the Japan
branch of the State Depart-
ment's Division of War East-
ern Research is William God-
frey Jones. This imposing re-
sponsibility carries a salary of
about $5000 a year. Mr. Jones
has a long life ahead. He is
32, and he graduated from col-
lege in 1939. He worked for the
OPA as an "economic analyst"
from 1941 to 1943. Then he
went into the Navy, and finally
joined the State Department
two years ago.
This experienced expert on
business, this grizzled veteran
of industry, has just received
a vast assignment. He goes to
Japan, according to the New
York Times, to "advise and as-
sist" in making an analysis of
the long-range needs of the
Japanese economy, and in mak-
ing recommendations "as to
production levels, plant caрас-
ity and capital requirements."
EVERY NEW DEAL DOGMA
No suggestion is made here
as to Mr. Jones' ideology nor
his earnest intentions. All that
this record reveals is his youth
and inexperience which he will
overcome, probably at a heavy
cost to a great industrial na-
tion's tottering economy.
It is worthy of note, how-
ever, because it fits so beau-
tifully into the schemes that
have flowed from the State
Department since the Japanese
surrender. These plans have
involved a wholesale moving
into Japan of many New Deal-
ers, formerly in such New
Deal agencies as the Bureau of
Economic Warfare. They have
from time to time revealed the
firm intention to make of the
Japanese economy a veritable
experimental farm for radical
economic theories. Almost ev-
ery New Deal dogma has ap-
peared either in practice or in
plans.
All of this is being achieved
through ostensible purposes of
purging Japanese industrialists
and breaking up or "deconcen-
trating" Japanese business.
Purging apparently means get-
ting rid of every Japanese who
knows how to run a business,
and deconcentration means to
get business property in the
hands of other owners, many
of whom are labor organiza-
tions and co-operatives.
NURSING COMMUNISTS
Since Japanese Communists
were brought back with great
care from exile and have
achieved dominating positions
in labor unions this cannot
help but result, if not checked,
in turning a large part of the
Japanese economy over to Com-
munist control.
Anyone who has seen New
Dealers at work in Washington
in past years knows how they
control policy, often without
their superior officers realizing
what is happening. A word here
or there in plans and direc-
tives, the execution of direc-
tives according to their specifi-
cations and the brave new
world emerges under the sol-
emn front of a President and
Cabinet who speak loudly of
free enterprise.
After Undersecretary Grew
had retired from office in Au-
gust, 1945, some basic additions
were made to the post-surren-
der directive on Japan, adopt-
ed by the State-War-Navy Co-
ordinating Committee. The ad-
ditions were for purging and
deconcentration. They were
phrased in typical New Deal
rhetoric and logic.
AN AMAZING DOCUMENT
Much later an amazing docu-
ment was unearthed by an
American lawyer. It was called
FEC 230. Among other things
it specified in effect that hold-
ings of Japanese companies
should be sold not for their
real value but for what the pur-
chaser was able to pay. Labor
unions were to be preferred.
This document was not
known to responsible Cabinet
officers in Washington until it
was shown to them by Ameri-
cans back from Japan. It was
repudiated, but the reorganiza-
tion of the Japanese economy
along ruinous New Deal lines
has not yet been successfully
checked.
This process does more to ad-
vance Communism than any di-
rect espionage that has been re-
cently revealed. And it has hard-
ly been noticed by Congress.
