Over confident Republicans
might well ponder Carlyle's
suggestion that "a dwarf be-
hind a steam engine can move
mountains." Only a giant can
move them with his hands.
Kepublicans should realize
that they are not running
against Truman. They are run-
ning against a great administration deeply entrenched, with
many economic controls at its
finger tips, with powerful means
of making headlines, with access
to information not available
to outsiders, and with a
ruthless will to use every means
to stay in power.
Dewey in confronting this
task must assemble great power
of attack and employ infinitely
skillful tactics. For this election may be no walkover, however rosy the prospects may
have been in July.
THE FACTOR OF PRICES
Let us consider two factors
in the campaign ahead.
It is a fair guess that despite
several factors tending to lower
prices generally the price structure will not change greatly
before the election. Meat, fuel
and metals will probably go
up a bit, with some other prices
declining. Textiles have of
course passed the peak. Grain
can sell below the support price,
largely because of the temporary lack of storage space. There
will be consumer resistance to
manufactured products boosted
by the third round of wage increases, but the effect of this
will not be great.
It has been frequently noted
in this column and elsewhere
that the administration has
powerful means by purchasing
for export and by propaganda
to keep grain prices from a
sharp decline. And there is
every evidence that these means
will be used.
In the realm of propaganda
the administration is using to
the full an old and not very
informative means of deceiving
people about prices, wages and
other vital subjects. It is using
only such comparisons as will
favor it. For example, if you
want to show an increase in
the price of a given product
you compare 1939 with 1948.
In another respect you use 1946
and 1948. And so forth. This
is confusing but effective.
On the foreign front the administration has an even
greater advantage. The Berlin
situation despite surface flur-
ries is growing more favorable
to a settlement. Russia seems
to be receding from its determination to push us out of Berlin. The threat of a western
German state has been temporarily effective as well as the
American coup in the battle of
the currencies.
Nothing can be known yet,
but for speculative purposes
suppose the present trouble
moves into the comparative
calm of a temporary truce.
Truman and his spokesmen can
claim a great diplomatic victory. The Marshall Plan will
be hailed as the decisive factor
in making a peace.
A vast sense of relief will
inspire the voting population.
Dewey will be confronted with
great trouble in shaping an
attack on the central foreign
policy of the administration.
There will be many minor
points of attack, but in the main
Dewey will be at a disadvantage.
This is no prediction of a
Truman victory. It is a suggestion that the Republican
candidates are not getting the
breaks in these hot summer
days.
