Pure Government Costs
More Than It Is Worth
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sometimes it seems as if it
costs more to prevent crook-
edness in government than it's
worth. This is a conclusion
forced upon the observer of our
cumbersome Federal bureauc-
racy. It is reinforced in read-
ing the successive reports of
the Hoover Commission.
There was, in other days,
plenty of reason to attack. dis-
honesty in public service. And
I do not mean to imply that
human nature is any better
now. But a generation in which
reform was concentrated on un-
earthing or preventing dishon-
esty has left barnacles on the
public service which cost us
more than the thieving of a
good many crooks.
SURETY BONDS
For example, there are 558,-
000 accountable officers in the
government. That means officers
who handle money and whose
honesty and accuracy must be
checked. These officers are re-
quired by law to furnish bond.
The premiums on these surety
bonds, which are written by pri-
vate companies, amount to
$2,000,000 annually. The amount
of recoveries on the bonds
is $230,000 annually.
There is no reason why the
government should not collect
all or a part of the difference
between these sums. Hence, the
Hoover Commission recom-
mends that a fidelity insurance
fund should be set up. in the
Treasury to which these officers
should contribute. In short, the
government would do its own
bonding business and save the
drain now going out to private
companies.
CHECKS AND RECHECKS
A very large proportion of
the $47,000,000 spent on the Gen-
eral Accounting Office goes into
an unwieldy checking of vouch-
ers. This is designed to protect
the Treasury against mistakes,
dishonesty and illegal expendi-
tures. Proper accounting in the
various departments would
eliminate much of this paper
shuffling. And an over-all selec-
tive audit would protect the
Treasury against serious dishon-
esty.
The Post Office Department,
according to the Hoover report,
is seriously hampered by 900
pages of detailed laws and regu-
lations â€” an accumulation of
generations.
As this column has already
pointed out, the government
keeps mountains of records,
presumably in the remote
chance that some check may be
necessary. Duplications and ob-
solete material could be thrown
away at a great saving.
CIVIL SERVICE RULES
The most important example
of the dead hand, however, is in
Civil Service regulations. They
were set up to protect govern-
ment against improper, dishon-
est or political appointments.
The effect is to freeze incompe-
tents in office, to frustrate ini-
tiative and consume executives'
time in red tape.
