"Now" is decidedly not "the
time for every good man to
come to the aid of his party."
It is a time for every man and
woman to put the interests of
his country ahead of party ad-
vantage, selfish interest and
minority affiliation.
For an election nas been neiu
in which neither great party
has received the sweeping elec-
toral mandate necessary to gov-
ern strongly. And this country,
in its dealing with pressing do-
mestic and foreign issues, never
so greatly needed a strong gov-
ernment well backed by an un-
mistakable popular majority.
Into this election came two
minority influences--the Dixie-
crats and the Wallaceites. The
Wallace vote, small as it was,
tipped the balance in some
States, particularly in the elec-
tion of members of Congress.
Protest votes, North and South,
carried influence far beyond
their just deserts.
PERIL OF SPLINTERS
We have seen how dangerous
a multiple party system might
be to the process of popular
government. It has weakened
and in some cases destroyed re-
publican governments abroad.
It might do that over here. We
escaped it by a very narrow
margin this time.
Another factor in this elec-
tion has been the influence of
specifically selfish interest. The
rural revolt against the Repub-
lican ticket in several Mid-
western States will be ascribed
to high farm prices and great
farm prosperity. Perhaps this
explains why so many voters in
States like Iowa and Wisconsin
voted against a change. If so,
it will be a means of impress-
ing upon politicians that they
must always yield to demands
for high prices, high wages and
special privileges of all kinds.
It will make political cowards
of people who might otherwise
be strong, resolute public serv-
ants.
The defeat of Ball in Minne-
sota by a combination of farm-
ers who thought he had voted
to deny them privileges and
union workers who oppose the
Taft-Hartley Act will discour-
age every young person who
wants to enter politics and vote
according to his convictions.
Convictions were apparently
not popular this year.
THE EXPERTS' DEBACLE
The Presidential race was so
close that no clear mandate can
be ascertained. Dewey ran bet-
ter than did the 80th Congress.
The result leaves us with a gov-
ernment which is not too strong.
To say that patriotism on both
sides should prevail over par-
tisanship is not merely to re-
peat a copy-book maxim. It is
to express a pressing practical
necessity.
It will be the responsibility
of the President, of strong and
influential members of Congress
and others to work jointly in all
matters of vital domestic and
international concern in order
to maintain stability, sound
finances and efficient govern-
ment.
This election was a sad day
for political experts, politicians
and pollsters. The feeling of
anyone who guessed wrong, in
print or otherwise, must be the
melancholy satisfaction that
there were many others in the
same boat. The wrong guesser
feels like the man who was dy-
ing and knew he was going to
the wrong place after lifeâ€”
there will be a lot of others
there.
