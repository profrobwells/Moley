President Truman's proposal
that the government take pre-
liminary steps toward entering
the steel industry is in the pat-
tern of one of the oldest politi-
cal and bureaucratic tricks in
history. It might be called the
nose-under-the-tent tactic. It
involves, first, a "survey," then
a small appropriation; later a
bigger one to justify the earlier
moves, and finally unending ex-
penditures, expansion and mo-
nopoly.
LABOR PRESSURE
What has happened is that
under pressure of socialistic
labor leaders one of the oldest
of New Deal contentions has
been given form and substance.
It has always been a favorite
theory of a group of business
critics, including several of the
New Deal Harvard Law School
boys, that the steel industry has
pursued an economy of scarcity.
Early in the war this issue
arose, and the noted engineer,
Gano Dunn, made a report for
President Roosevelt denying
the contention of those who
wanted large additions to steel
capacity. The Dunn report
slowed down the efforts to put
government into the steel busi-
ness but did not check them
completely. Large loans were
floated for additional steel ca-
pacity and, as everyone knows,
the government after the war
disposed of large holdings.
The facts again make it hard
to see any reason other than
political and ideological ones in
reviving the idea now.
THE NAZI PARALLEL
Since the President in his
campaign suggested that his
opponent, like Hitler in prewar
Germany, was dominated by
selfish businessmen, It may be
pertinent to suggest another
parallel. In 1936 Herman Goer-
ing, in order more adequately
to arm Germany, urged the
German steel industry to double
its capacity. The industry,
under the leadership of Fritz
Thyssen, refused to do so.
Thereupon Germany built the
world's largest government
steel plant, the Herman Goering
Werke. It also drove Thyssen
from the leadership of the in-
dustry and forced him into ex-
ile. From that point the non-
Goering part of the industry
was in effect nationalized.
In the Parliamentary debates
on the question of nationalizing
steel in Britain, it always seemed
to be assumed by Cripps and
others that government and
government alone should de-
termine whether the public was
adequately served. This assump-
tion was strongly contested by
opponents of nationalization, but
without avail. The same as-
sumption seems to prevail in
the Truman proposal.
But in this case public opin-
ion will play a larger part.
None of the charges of ineffi-
ciency and neglect which pre-
vailed in Britain can be suc-
cessfully made here. The Ameri-
can steel industry is progres-
sive and efficient far beyond
the dreams of British socialism.
As this becomes known, the
Truman threat can hardly be
effective in Congress.
