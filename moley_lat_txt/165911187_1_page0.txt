Let's Have Principles
and Fewer 'Dilemmas'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When all the minor factors
which concern the Dutch gov-
ernment's action in Indonesia
have been added together, the
case of that government is
neither black nor white. It is
a sort of dull gray.
That being true, an American
can only ask his own govern-
ment to stand on broad prin-
ciples and do what it can to en-
force them. Those principles
are first, that we believe in
self-government; second, that
we believe in the United Na-
tions; third, that we believe in
negotiation, not force, and
fourth, that we believe in the
sanctity of agreements. These
broad issues need little discus-
sion. We have fought two wars
for them.
RED ISSUE MOOT
Regarding Communism, there
is enough to be said on both
sides to cancel out that issue.
On one side it can be said that
to isolate the Netherlands and
deny all ERP help would injure
the fabric of European recovery
and help Communism. There
is also the fact that some mem-
bers of the Indonesian repub-
lic's ruling group are Commu-
nists. Against these facts stands
the solid consideration that if
we desert the republic, Commu-
nism will grow in Indonesia,
India and China.
We have shown such half-
hearted interest in the legiti-
mate aspirations of the Chinese
people in our support of the
rotten Chiang regime that we
have lost face in China. And in
the past we were so afraid of
offending English Tories that
we have no great prestige in In-
dia. We can easily contribute
to Communism in Indonesia
as well as in China and India
by a tender policy toward Dutch
Imperialism.
MONOPOLISTIC PROFIT
When all incidental Dutch
excuses and justifications are
brushed aside, this is substan-
tially a war for dividends. This
rich colonial possession has
long been the only remaining
jewel In the Dutch Empire--
called "Insulinde" by the Dutch.
The Dutch claim that its explot-
tation is essential to the pros-
perity of Holland. But this is a
claim that can be disputed and,
In any event, it is not a legiti-
mate answer to the claim of
human rights. England, too,
would have been better off had
it retained the rich jewel now
known as the United States.
The basis of Dutch foreign poli-
cy is profit-exclusive and mo-
hopolistic profit at that.
American exporters have felt
the impact of the Dutch policy
since the war. Under quota
regulations set up by the Neth-
erlands Indies government,
American exporters have been
almost completely barred from
free access to the rich Indo-
nesian market. Monopolistic
importing companies under
Dutch control are the channels
through which our goods reach
the islands.
AMERICANS PROTEST
When they reach their desti-
nation they go to a few favored
importers. Presumably, the
Dutch government is the bene-
ficiary of this channel. Ameri-
can exporters say that no other
country monopolizes trade to
this extent. They have repeat-
edly protested to our State De-
partment, with scant results.
Meanwhile, "dividends" from
the United States have been
eagerly sought and accepted by
the Netherlands. The ECA
granted $298,500,000 to the
Netherlands, and the allocation
for Indonesia was set at $68,-
000,000.
Diplomatic officials have a
way of soliciting public patience
for inaction by piling up an
account of detailed problems so
high that the real issues are
hidden. These matters are often
called "dilemmas." That is
true of much that we hear
about this month's Dutch ag-
gression.
When are we going to have
an end to "dilemmas" and a re-
turn to basic principles? There
can be no equivocation about
our belief in self-government, in
the United Nations' right to
stop aggression, in the priority
of negotiation and in the sancti-
ty of agreements. All these are
fundamental in the Dutch im-
broglio.
