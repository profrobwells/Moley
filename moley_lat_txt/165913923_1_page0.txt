RAYMOND MOLEY:
Committee Is Justified
in Spite of Everything
The House Committee on Un-
American Activities has been
one of the most durable of our
government's agencies. Under
former Rep. Dies and, later,
under Rep. Thomas, it weath-
ered heavy storms.
It wu l1esueuils have attack u
it. Mrs. Roosevelt has pr-
sistently denounced it. Pow r-
ful newspapers have called i or
its abolition. A small group of
Congressman has brought v-
ery means to bear against t.
The Department of Justice h is
not been friendly. But over al d
over it has been confirmed l y
overwhelming bipartisan Hou e
votes and more and more mon y
has been given for its work.
A SOLID BASIS
Now it would seem that the
Committee can survive the i-
lictment of its chairman, man
confessed mistakes in procedur e
and a bewildering election u-
et. Such consistent strengt a
nust have a deep and soli l
Dasis. Congressmen do not vot
n such great majorities fo
hings which are not heavil
upported at home. The Amer-
an people have really wante!
his Committee, despite th
nemies it has made.
This public support of th
ommittee, no doubt, is becaus
four conviction as American!
hat we have a way of life
hich can be undermined and
ndangered by types of propa-
anda and undercover activi-
es inspired from abroad. And
at while there is no disposi-
on to curtail freedom of
beech and the press, it is the
ity of government to expose
id outlaw activities genuinely
imical to our institutions.
ne additional function exer-
sed by the Committee in in-
stigating the executive branch
the government, while inci-
ntal to the discovery of un-
nerican activities, centers in
established right of Congress
determine how nublic monow
is being spent.
CHAMBERS AND HISS
In the Chambers-Hiss case,
the two functions mentioned
above are united. Chambers
represented a subversive, alien
movement. Hiss was a member
of the government. And if the
allegations of Chambers are
true, the Committee has not
only exposed a subversive move-
ment of great importance but
it has shown that the executive
department not only employed
improper personnel, but in its
law anfarnamant Sunationa
failed to discover and deal with
a dangerous subversive move-
ment.
The President in his denuncia-
tion of the Un-American Ac-
â€¢tivities Committee has risked
a flat defeat at the very opening
of the new Congress. For by
any calculation there are
enough votes to reject any ef-
fort to abolish it. Perhaps the
best course the President and
his leaders can take is to accept
the inevitable and then show
how much better they can do
the job. If it is procedure which
has been defective, let the new
Democratic Congress set up
something better. There is room
for improvement, but no con-
structive suggestions have been
made. Here is a real challenge
and opportunity for the critics.
PRESIDENT'S CHARGES
The President has not helped
himself by his reckless charges
of partisanship. The Committee
has unearthed enough to create
a profound distrust in our State
Department. The Chambers
revelations are serious. It may
be true that the secret docu-
ments will not prove to have
vitally affected our safety. Any-
one who has served in the policy-
making ranges of the State De-
partment knows that reams of
rubbish come in marked "confi-
dential," and that much of this
is no secret to newspapermen.
But the fact that documents
were secretly handed out to an
agent of a foreign government
reveals a deplorable state of
affairs in the very nerve center
of government.
A conviction exists in the
minds of a great many members
of Congress that there is a great
deal more to come. The rela-
tions between Chambers and
Hiss have not been cleared up.
Nor has it become clear that
the disclosures so far have
covered all those who were
implicated in the espionage.
There may be herrings other
than the red ones yet to be
dragged to the light..
