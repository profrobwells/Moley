International
Monetary Mess
Needs Tidying
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman's glowing
inaugural picture of world aid
will need a framework of
international monetary reform.
For merely the pouring out of
American money and goods
will not do the job.
Last year negan witn worries
about world food production.
This year there is food, but
distribution is paralyzed by the
disintegration of monetary sys-
tems. This is the conclusion of
Edith J. Hirsch, industrial and
food economist. There is
mounting evidence that her
warning should be taken seri-
ously.
Mrs. Hirsch goes on to point
out that deficiencies and
surpluses exist in the same
commodities. at the same time.
Sugar is rationed in a number
of European countries while
Cuba is looking for markets.
Denmark is rationing sugar in
order to export it because her
high-cost sugar has preference
over the low-cost Cuban pro-
duction. Citrus fruit is badly
needed in most of Europe, al-
though American growers have
been complaining about rising
supplies.
HARD MONEY SCARCE
The countries with the largest
surpluses have a serious lack of
currency. The currencies of
the United States, Canada and
Cuba are scarce and, despite the
ECA, they will remain scarce
until these countries decide to
increase imports. The hard
money which we are making
available through exports, loans
and gifts is being absorbed by
the need for so-called invest-
ment goods such as industrial
and agricultural equipment.
Many countries formerly de-
pendent on imports for food
have learned to be self-sufficient
by producing more high caloric
bread and potatoes and fewer
livestock products and fruit.
Since semisocialism has made
government planning more
prevalent, these food policies
are becoming much easier to
enforce.
BARTER TRADE
As the world's monetary
system disintegrates, certain
markets are drying up-notably
those. for wheat and barley.
There is one market for "dol-
lar grain;" another for pound
sterling grain. Finally, there
are the barter-trade wheat mar-
kets. Prices in these markets
are not uniform. They reflect
the distortions in the official
exchange rates of currencies.
The countries behind the
Iron Curtain which have gen-
erally gone over to a barter
economy seem to be gaining in
their trade with Western
Europe. Great Britain, after
the benefits of years of generous
giving from Canada, now regret-
fully tells that sister common-
wealth that Great Britain must
reduce its purchases of beef,
eggs and cheese. Meanwhile,
she has made a five-year trade
agreement with Poland which
will bring bacon and eggs to the
island. Eggs are flowing from
Bulgaria. Next year, when our
meat production expands, we
may have to refuse Canadian
meat.
STATESMANSHIP NEED
Despite the fine words of
International organizations and
grand plans for commodity
agreements, the hard fact of
unworkable monetary systems
remains.
Moreover, our grand asser-
tions about capitalistic
superiority will have to be
implemented by monetary
statesmanship, if barter, the
foster child of totalitarianism,
is not to make great gains
despite all our efforts.
