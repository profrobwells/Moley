For the third successive
month the government's retail
price index has shown a decline.
But we are seeing on all sides
evidence that this barometer is
already far behind the facts. It
takes two months to complete
this complex statistical formula,
and in many lines the law of
supply and demand operates
with incredible speed. So the
real drop is probably much
greater than the government
figures indicate.
This steady flattening out of
the inflationary boom is causing
hasty changes in plans, both
in the White House and in the
headquarters of many unions.
The President says that he has
sent his economic advisers back
to their figuring to get him another
report. The elaborate report of
three weeks ago is already
somewhat dated.
LABOR SHIFTS GOALS
In the labor field a broad
shift of policy is under way.
The hardy perennial, John L.
Lewis, will bloom less lustily
this year. Mother Nature has
provided a mild winter for the
eastern market, with less coal
burning. Coal exports are cut
because Europe is producing
more and more coal of its own.
A coal strike in such a situation
would be a foolish and costly
blunder.
With frantic clothing sales
blazened in every store, the garment
workers have decided against a
new round of wage demands.
The United Auto Workers are
shifting their emphasis from
wages to pensions. Automobile
dealers are having some trouble
selling less popular makes of
cars, and various forms of discounts
on high-priced cars are reported.
Walter Reuther is following the
formula of John L. Lewis, but is a
year behind. He is aiming at the
broad schedule of benefits gained
by the miners, with pensions in the
foreground.
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
This demand, which will certainly
spread to other strongly unionized
industries, raises fundamental
questions. The first is a question
of economic principle. Is a pension
to be regarded as a substitute for
wages, which in any competitive
system vary from time to time and
from industry to industry? Are such
plans to be administered by the
company or by the union? Are they
to be paid for by the company directly
as a charge against production or
are they to assume the form of a
royalty payment on each car or ton
of steel or what not? And what
relationship will exist between such
pensions and government-supported
plans?
A still more fundamental
question arises: Are the workers
in industries in which workers
have superior means of paralyzing
the community to become a pension
elite? This is certainly true of
railway employees, coal miners and
utility workers. There is an issue of
justice in this. If such favorably
placed unions are to enjoy a
monopolistic position should the
government, representing all less
favored workers, make up the
difference through taxation?
All these questions should be
considered when, as is promised,
the President places before Congress
his plans for broadening and
increasing Social Security in this
session of Congress.
