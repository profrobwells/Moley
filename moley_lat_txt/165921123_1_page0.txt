Public Policy Will See
Great Changes in 1949
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Three great fields of public
policy and decision open up as
we move into the new year.
And in all three it looks as if
1949 will differ from 1948 as
sharply as will 1950.
In an indefinable way we
seem to have reached in 1948
the culmination or end of trends
which began with the end of
the war. Trends are now
changing perhaps even more
rapidly than official Washington
realizes. The three fields of
decision in which changes are
so likely to come are foreign
affairs, domestic economic pol-
icy and social welfare.
SUBSIDING TENSIONS
Despite occasional flares of
crises and despite the prospect
of another year of cold war,
European tension will subside.
The Soviet tide in Europe is
ebbing. Tito, the weathervane,
is turning to the west for
benefits he has failed to get
from the Iron Curtain. Russian
peace moves in Austria are
significant. There are strong
evidences, recently noted by
Walter Lippmann in Europe,
that Russia is making no war
plans in Europe. Western Eu-
rope will reach more and more
stability.
But the steady success of the
Communists in China opens a
growing issue in the Orient.
Three billion American dollars
in three years have been wasted
on the Kuomintang outfit. The
new dispensation in China may
well avoid Russian domination,
but it can hardly be overly
friendly to the United States.
Warfare will flare in Indo-
nesia, and India will stir with
unrest.
In short, our sharper concerns
in 1949 will turn from Europe
to Asia.
Nineteen hundred and forty-
eight will be remembered as the
year of the great inflation.
Nineteen hundred and forty-
nine may well be a year of slow
recession. Policies aiming at
the control of inflation will be
abandoned and methods of pre-
venting deflation will come to
the fore.
The President's advisers will
be preparing for unemployment
by making plans for more public
works and emergency relief. If
business tapers off, there will
probably be a considerable re-
duction in business investment.
Threats of new taxes will bear
down on expansions. Good econ-
omists estimate a reduction of
three or four billions in business
investment. This will mean
less employment.
The cost of living index,
which appears some weeks after
the events, shows continuing
decline.
The President's Council of
Economic Advisers is growing
"philosophical" toward labor.
This is in line with an expected
effort to retreat from its fa-
vorable attitude toward wage
increases and radical revisions
in labor laws.
SOCIAL WELFARE
Trends in a third field—social
welfare—will be significant.
The Hoover Commission will
strongly advise a reorganization
of the welfare activities of the
Federal government. This will
be one series of recommenda-
tions which will have sympa-
thetic support from the Presi-
dent and Congress.
The obvious need for more
efficiency and economy in vet-
erans' affairs will get attention.
So will the misshapen struc-
ture of Social Security. Public
health measures and health in-
surance will reach the stage of
Congressional debate, after
years of skirmishing.
The public will hear much
more of new methods of pro-
viding minimum standards for
all. The New Deal will seek
to start once more on lines
abandoned in the face of war
nine years ago.
All these new directions of
policy will provide lively public
interest in the portentous
year we now enter.
