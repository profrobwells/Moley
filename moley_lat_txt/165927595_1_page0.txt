President Truman may be
surprised at the revelations of
influence and favoritism that
are unrolling in Washington.
But he can hardly say he was
not warned. The fact is that
he warned himself a long time
ago, through the committee
whose chairmanship made him
an eligible for nomination for
Vice-President.
In 1947, a book appeared en-
titled "Diary of Democracy,"
which was written by Harry
A. Toulmin Jr. It was an ac-
count, in very enthusiastic
terms, of the operations of the
Truman War Investigating
Committee. It was dedicated
to the members of the com-
mittee, including Harry S. Tru-
man, chairman. The introduc-
tion was written by Sen. Kil-
gore, another member. In the
chapter on "Lobbying and War
Frauds Investigations," the fol-
lowing appears:
"The subject of lobbying lies
in that shadowy land between
outright crookedness and greed
leading into transactions that
are thought to be shady but
are really not. The humor of
the situation was that so many
small and intermediate busi-
nesses sought to obtain bene-
fits by hiring men on com-
mission who represented that
they had influence or friend-
ship; whereas they had noth-
ing at all except a great deal
of gall and the gift of gab. The
commission for such hot air
ranged from 5 to 10% of the
contract price to much more
fantastic figures. The com-
mittee cleaned up one of the
nastiest messes that was
plaguing the armed services by
exposing these locust repre-
sentatives."
Then there follows a long
quote from Senate Report 480:
"Sometimes those seeking
contracts take the initiative
and employ persons whom they
expect to use influence in their
behalf. For obvious reasons,
no contract is made between
them, and in most instances
there is no express conversa-
tion with respect to the use of
influence. Those who seek to
take unfair advantage of their
government are no more likely
to say so, even to their inti-
mates, than criminals are like-
ly to admit their crimes or to
characterize their acts. Con-
sequently, they frequently pay
for what is neither promised
nor delivered to them... the
committee did a great service
to the American public in
bringing this disgraceful situa-
tion into the open and largely
eliminating it."
The President may be impa-
tient of those reflections that
are being cast upon people near
him. But he can hardly deny
that the record of his commit-
tee, for which presumably he
takes full credit, points up the
problem as well as it has been
described anywhere.
The claim that the commit-
tee largely eliminated such
practices can be dismissed as a
species of campaign rhetoric.
But since the real author of
these warnings is now the
Chief Executive, we may ex-
pect that he, above all, will
wish that further elimination
will be in order.
