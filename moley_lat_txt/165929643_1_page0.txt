Government Can't Spend
Nation Into Prosperity
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman comes close
to paraphrasing a famous re-
mark of former President Hoo-
ver early in the great depres-
sion two decades ago. Inflation,
the President seems to say, is
just around the corner. He still
wants stand-by powers for price
control and rationing.
His point of view is undoubt-
edly based on the reasoning of
some of his economic advisers.
Behind their thinking there
seems to be an assumption that
a general decline is unlikely be-
cause there are what might be
called certain "depression-proof"
areas in our economy. One of
these is the huge expenditure
for armament. Another is a
high demand for food and cloth-
ing. Another is European re-
lief.
A CURIOUS IDEA
The most curious of their
ideas, however, is that because
government spending is so great
and because it comprises so
large a part of the national in-
come, the cost of government is
part of our defense against de-
flation. This needs some spell-
ing out.
It is a fact that Federal ex-
penditures for next year may
run to about $42,000,000,000,
with two or three more for
Social Security. State and local
budgets look like $15,000,000,000
more. If we add other poten-
tial costs, the figure for govern-
ment may go to $62,000,000,000,
which comes close to a third of
our possible national income.
DEFLATION DEFENSE
To see this as a defense
against deflation, however, is to
accept the thesis that we can
spend ourselves into prosperity.
But it is hard to accept that
thesis, because that one-third of
our income must be supported
by taxes on the other two-
thirds. Surely, no one could
claim that if we increased gov-
ernment costs indefinitely we
would increase our national in-
come indefinitely. Ultimately,
inflation would destroy all sav-
ings and taxes would crush all
incentive. If this be the basis of
government optimism, we shall
have to look elsewhere for cheer.
It is possible but dangerous
to argue about a "depression-
proof" economy. In the great
depression, our national income
fell from $80,000,000,000 in 1929
to $45,000,000,000 in 1933. This
was a drop of about 44%. But
the volume of goods and serv-
ices fell only 25%. The rest of
the drop was due to price re-
ductions. There was thus a
large "depression-proof" area,
even in the great depression.
But that hardly saved us from
national disaster.
FARM PROSPERITY
It may be dangerous to speak
of depression-proof areas, but
it is reasonable to consider what
might better be called protec-
tions against a recurrence of
1929-33. One of these is agricul-
ture, which despite current
price declines is still highly
prosperous. Another is the rel-
atively smaller burden of debt.
And it must be considered that
expenditures for defense keep
certain industries moving which
were the hardest to revive 16
years ago.
But, as Sen. George has point-
ed out, a further effort to raise
taxes for government spending
is deflationary and should be
resisted by all who realize the
danger of a rapid decline. The
base of our Babylonian tower
is the production and consump-
tion of goods in private affairs.
The height of the tower can
crumble the base.
