Surveys Texas'
Fabulous Coast
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At the annual convention of
the East Texas Chamber of
Commerce, just held at Beaumont, there was less boasting
and more facing of unpleasant
facts than this reporter has
ever seen on such an occasion.
The theme of the meeting was
"Facing the Facts."
The president of the Chamber,
Harold Hamlin, said that, while
his organization was willing to
yield to none in love for the
State, "Texas bragging has been
indulged too much and often
without the facts."
Some of the less pleasant
facts that he asked the convention to consider were that
most of the counties of Texas
have been losing population;
that in the East Texas area
farm production per cow is
nothing to brag about; that
rural health and housing need
attention, and that the rising
cost of government is a burden
that threatens even this immensely wealthy industrial
area.
NOTHING LIKE IT
The area of which he was
speaking includes a large part
of Eastern Texas, with the industrial region of Dallas at the
northwest and the Houston-
Beaumont-Port Arthur region at
the southeast.
But while it is fine and unusual that such an organization
should take such an attitude of
self-criticism, there is nothing
to prevent this visitor from
expressing some of the amazement felt in the course of three
visits during the past month
to this corner of the largest
American State.
The Houston-Beaumont-Port
Arthur region needs to be considered as a unit. It runs along
the Gulf for about 150 miles
and inland about half that distance. It has two natural sea-
ports, Galveston and Port
Arthur, and two major man-
made ports. There are in addition a dozen other important
cities. It is not an exaggeration
to say that there is nothing like
this in the world.
H. G. WELLS' PREDICTION
It is said down here that
H. G. Wells once stated that
the Gulf Coast would sometime be the economic center of
the world. But even an imagination like that of Wells could
hardly predict what has happened here. Much has been said
and written of the potentialities
of Houston, and most of all
that is true. Houston may well
reach a population of 2,000,000
in the next dozen years.
But the Beaumont-Port
Arthur side of this region has
almost equal possibilities. It
was within three miles of
Beaumont that the Lucas-
Spindletop gusher broke loose 48
years ago. The discovery of
that field revolutionized the oil
industry and in its consequences virtually revolutionized
the economic life of the world.
FROM OIL TO RICE
The petrochemical industry,
which is scattered all over the
region, was built in the last
eight years. Its potentialities
are unlimited.
But this is not a region dependent entirely upon oil. There
are cattle and other agricultural
products in great abundance. In
the region around this part of
the Gulf immense areas are
devoted to rice. The largest rice-
packaging plant in the world
is in Beaumont.
Finally, it should be added
that this is the center and outlet for an immense lumber
industry. Beaumont originated
a century ago as a lumber town.
