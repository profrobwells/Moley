American diplomatic policy-
makers admit privately a shift
in their policy toward Russia,
which becomes apparent if we
peer closely through the torrent
of words pouring out of Paris.
We are not primarily con-
cerned with the future of in-
ternal Russia, its Politburo or
its form of government. We
are not trying to provoke revo-
lution against its Communist
masters.
We are not worried about
China, except incidentally.
We are, however, concerned
in pushing western influence
into the European satellites of
Russia, and if measures are
taken in Paris to achieve that
end, we may count this con-
ference a success.
That is why nothing may
be accomplished except the
opening of more trade with
Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and even Bul-
garia and Rumania.
As far as Russia is concerned,
foreign trade has never been
very important.
The Soviets have been con-
cerned with foreign trade only
to help in industrial recon-
struction and in armament. The
Russian peasant, when he can-
not get foreign-made clothes or
something better than his old
seythe, is accustomed to resign
himself to the inevitable and to
wait.
It is absurd to believe that
restrictions in trade aimed at
Russia are effective weapons.
The exchange of goods can be
dispensed with by the Soviets.
If they want something des-
perately, they will mine gold to
get it. They care little about
exporting goods.
This is not true of the satel-
lite states. Their populations
have had a much higher stand-
ard of living than that of the
Russians. Poland, Czechoslo-
vakia and Hungary have in the
past enjoyed a well-organized
trade with the west. They
have taken large quantities of
consumer goods, tools, machin-
ery, electrical equipment, motor
vehicles and other articles in
exchange for gram and other
foodstuffs. Czechoslovakia,
moreover, has exported the
products of highly skilled in-
dustries.
Under the postwar puppet
governments these countries
have been bound by Russian
trade restrictions, but they have
found many an opening in the
Iron Curtain. Yugoslavia has
been openly contemptuous of
eastern threats and controls.
The Russian zone in Germany
has been brought down to
low levels of production by
the dismantling and removal
of industries and the seizure
of reparations out of current
production. Germans living
there are bitterly resentful of
restrictions against trade with
neighboring satellite states.
Even the Russians have an
interest in the introduction of
western goods into Eastern
Germany, since the meager sup-
plies they have been providing
have been at the expense of
their own people.
