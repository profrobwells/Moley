Tucker Case as an Example
of Government in Business
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Under the Economic Expan-
sion Act of 1949, sponsored by
Sens. Murray, Humphrey, Ke-
fauver, Kilgore, McMahon, Pep-
per, Sparkman and Thomas, the
President would receive wide
powers to co-operate with busi-
nesses wanting to get under
way and, when he deems it
necessary, to put the govern-
ment directly into business.
This is part of a plan "to
develop prompt specific meas-
ures to help deal with
economic maladjustments." Note,
in the light of what follows,
that "prompt" and "specific"
measures are the purpose of the
plan.
Now, in view of the case of
Preston Tucker and his fab-
ulous career, recently high-
lighted by a Federal indictment,
let us consider what govern-
ment co-operation may involve.
For no doubt the sympathy and
relationship of various political
forces with the Tucker enter-
prise were inspired by a desire
to set up a new business and
encourage what the Murray
plan calls "maximum employ-
ment, production, purchasing
power and confidence." In any
event, the help of various gov-
ernment agencies was essential
to the huge enterprise projected
by Tucker.
It ought to be noted that
when government invests mon-
ey or property in a business, it
not only helps directly with that
money or property but, because
government is expected to be a
smart investor, it encourages
private investors to add their
money. Whether any of the
people who invested in the
Tucker enterprise were thus
encouraged is not in the record.
It is now evident that the
deal for the $171,000,000 govern-
ment plant was carried through
with infinite consideration for
Tucker and with tragic lack of
business judgment. Likewise,
the War Assets Administration
seemed to be unaware of facts
known to other government
agencies which should have pre-
vented the conclusion of the
deal.
The facts in this connection,
which will come to light in later
judicial proceedings and some
a Senate investigation, were
characterized by Sen. Ferguson
as "flagrant cases of maladmin-
istration and mismanagement."
The SEC, designated by its
sponsors, including President
Roosevelt, as a means of pro-
tecting investors, apparently did
a poor job of protection in this
case. Its purpose was politely
called "disclosure." The theory
was good-namely, that after
the SEC compelled complete
recital of facts in a prospectus,
investors were free to choose.
The most conservative judg-
ment of the situation is that if,
under the Murray plan, the gov-
ernment is to become a partner
and accelerator of private busi-
ness, it will have to do better
than it did in the Tucker case.
And by the time a real inves-
tigation is made in each case,
it may be too late to provide
"prompt" and "specific" meas-
ures to relieve shortages of
employment and production.
