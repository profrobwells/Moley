Proposed Postal Increase
Threatens All Periodicals
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
One of the most serious
threats ever facing the Ameri-
can press is contained in bills
now before the House and Sen-
ate prepared, it is said, under
the sponsorship of the Post Of-
fice Department. They provide
for a drastic increase in second-
class postal rates on a scale
graduated according to the
proportions of each publica-
tion that is devoted to adver-
tising. In the second year of
operation of the plan, there
would be a further increase of
50%.
The best way to show the
relative size of this increase is
to cite some figures presented
to the House Post Office Com-
mittee by Walter D. Fuller,
president of the Curtis Publish-
ing Co. Fuller stated that at
present his five magazines pay
about $4,000,000 a year for sec-
ond-class mail.
RUINOUS CHARGES
Under the rates in the pro-
posed bills and assuming the
same circulation, the second-
class charge would be more
than $12,500,000, and in the
second and every succeeding
year it would be $19,000,000.
What that would do to his com-
pany can be shown by the fact
that in the big year 1948 it
made $5,500,000.
Newspapers, of course, would
not be so seriously affected as
magazines, but their cost of op-
eration would be greatly in-
creased. Representatives of the
publishers appeared before the
House Committee last week and
made that abundantly clear.
Newspapers would be affected
in accordance with the extent
to which they sell papers
through the mail.
In cases where a paper has
wide circulation and influence
beyond its place of publication,
the government would thus im-
pose a heavy penalty. The re-
sult would be increases in rates
for mail subscriptions prob-
ably far beyond the ability of
the public to pay. The increases
could hardly be passed along
12 advertisers because the cost
of advertising is already about
as high as the traffic will bear.
CREATES MONOPOLY
While the effect of this leg-
islation would impose a heavy
burden on all newspapers and
actually destroy some, it would
be disastrous to magazines. It
would probably compel at least
half of our national publica-
tions to close up shop. The blow
would be especially heavy on
farm publications and also on
small specialized journals of a
professional, trade, cultural or
religious nature.
Since some big magazines
would be able with much dif-
ficulty and great expense to sell
themselves on newsstands ex-
clusively, they would ultimate-
ly monopolize the field. And the
irony of it all would be reduc-
tion, rather than an increase
in Post Office revenues. Thus
we have another illustration of
administration economics.
