U.S., Mexico
Join to Fight
Cattle Plague
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gilbert Chesterton once said
that the members of the British
Empire were like passengers
in an omnibus. They found
unity only in an accident. The
United States and Mexico have
found one of the most potent
stimulants of friendly relations
in a common danger and a
shared misfortune. That deadly
enemy of cattle and other ani-
mals, aftosa, or the foot-and-
mouth disease, constitutes an
ever-present problem for both
nations, and its control or erad-
ication can be accomplished
only by joint efforts.
During the present week here
in Houston the 72nd annual
convention of the Texas and
Southwestern Cattle Raisers'
Association is giving major at-
tention to the joint attack on
the disease by the United States
and Mexico. Members and direc-
tors of the joint Mexico-United
States Aftosa Commission are
present and are giving in de-
tail the progress of the fight
against this scourge that
knows no national boundaries.
THREE YEAR WAR
This disease has appeared in
the United States on 10 differ-
ent occasions. The first epi-
demic was in 1870; the most
recent, in 1929. Losses suffered
by our cattle raisers ran to
more than $150,000,000 and the
cost to Federal and State gov-
ernments in fighting the disease
was $25,000,000 more. It is esti-
mated that 345,000 cattle, sheep,
hogs and other cloven-hoofed
animals were slaughtered in
these wars. If the disease
should reappear in the United
States the costs would be far
greater than in any preceding
attack.
A raging attack in Mexico
started in 1946. This was traced
to the importation of some
Brazilian cattle. The govern-
ment of Mexico officially asked
for aid and Congress responded
with legislation and funds.
The joint commission was
formed and was given authority
by both countries to carry on
its work.
The infected zone is an area
in South Central Mexico, 250
miles wide, running from coast
to coast. This area is quaran-
tined. The attack on the disease
includes quarantine, disinfec-
tion, limited slaughter of ani-
mals, general inspection and
vaccination.
The greatest hope for per-
manent relief is in vaccination.
THREAT SUBSIDING
It goes without saying that
the vaccination of millions of
cattle is an undertaking of great
moment. Some 3000 employees
are already working at this
task under the commission, 500
of whom are from the United
States. It is too early to tell
how permanent the immunity
will be. The process is still
experimental, but the hopes of
the commission are high.
Meanwhile, the threat to the
United States is subsiding.
It is refreshing here in this
joint meeting to note the com-
plete lack of suspicion and an-
tagonism between these repre-
sentatives of two nations whose
past relations have never been
of the best. This joint effort
is worth hundreds of goodwill
speeches and pious resolutions.
It is friendship born of practi-
cal good works.
