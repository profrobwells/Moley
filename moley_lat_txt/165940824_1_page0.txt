Labor Has More Wage Sense
Than Administration Shows
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Business, as, well as the great
mass of people lying outside
politics and collective bargain-
ing, is now interested in what
government and union labor are
planning to do.
The President's advisers and
other New Deal elements in
Washington are still intent on
talking against inflation while
working toward inflation. Their
purpose in this is to get into the
hands of government more pow-
er to regiment the economy
through price controls, ration-
ing and allocation.
But labor is moving with
more caution and is taking bet-
ter account of the signs of the
times.
That weathervane of labor
strategy, John L. Lewis, has
apparently decided to make no
move to open new wage con-
tract talks until May, because
he wants to see what will hap-
pen in general business condi-
tions.
The CIO is still moving to-
ward inflation through schemes
for welfare benefits, including
new forms of socialized medi-
cine. The United Automobile
Workers threaten to use the
Ford Co. as a focus attack for
such demands.
The AFL is not relaxing its
efforts to prove that wage in-
creases have been eaten up by
higher living costs. But this is
largely for public consumption.
Underneath, there is a realistic
conviction that gains from now
on will not follow a general pat-
tern but will accept various
compromises according to con-
ditions in specific industries.
Moreover, AFL leadership is
taking account of certain funda-
mentals. One of these is the
matter of productivity. It is
recognized that in some lines
wage increases have run far be-
yond a fair increase in the pro-
duction of wealth in goods.
In such cases inflation in
prices and wages means "fools'
profits," both to labor and man-
agement. The real interest of
labor is in stabilization of wages
and profits, with steady in-
creases in productivity.
When the trend toward infla-
tion or deflation is general, ob-
vious and menacing, there is
some justification for the inter-
ference of government in the
trend of wages. In a moment
like this, when no general pat-
tern is visible; government
might well be advised to make
no public judgments about wage
policies. To do so will not only
upset specific adjustments in a
way harmful both to labor and
management, but frustrate the
efforts of moderate labor lead-
ers to work for the stabilization
that we all need.
