Forrestal's Death Points Up
Unsettled Defense Problems
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The crack-up and tragic end
of former Defense Secretary
Forrestal should shock every-
one concerned—and that in-
cludes the larger part of the
press and public—into a realiza-
tion of our profoundly un-
settled problems of defense.
For it is clear that after the
heavy drain of war years had
taken their share of Forrestal's
energies, there was enough left
for a long and happy life. It
was the heartbreaking task of
trying to resolve inter-service
rivalries that finally broke his
health and spirits.

The Air Force, in its struggle
for deserved recognition as a
"co-ordinate branch of defense,"
has developed terrific propa-
ganda and political power. This
has moved on beyond mere
recognition of the co-ordinate
place of air power to an at-
tempt to establish the principle
that the Air Force can probably
win a war alone.
In its expansive push the
Air Force has crowded the
Navy to the wall and has
created a well-grounded feeling
that the forced decline in the
world's greatest Navy may
proceed to a point where it will
be merely an auxiliary arm of
the service—a lumbering car-
rier of Air Force and armed
personnel and material. This
assertion of power Forrestal, as
a former Navy Secretary,
sought to moderate, with quite
inconclusive results.

The fact is admitted by more
enlightened Navy people that
air power has made it neces-
sary to reconsider the old
thesis, best expressed by Adm.
Mahan in the 90s, that sea
power is the determining factor
in world rule. The Navy think-
ing has not been dominated, as
is alleged, by "battleship ad-
mirals," but by air-minded
officers. The contention of the
Navy is that air power and the
Air Force are not identical and
mutually inclusive.
This dispute deserves atten-
tion not only because future
security is involved, but be-
cause there is a critical need
that economies be made in the
general defense budget. The
Hoover Commission and Her-
bert Hoover himself have point-
ed out how at least a billion
dollars can be saved. This can
be saved without crippling
either the bomber program or
the carrier development. More
savings, however, might be
possible if a rational examina-
tion of air power could be
made.
