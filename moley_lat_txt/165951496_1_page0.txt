Planners Can Speed Slump
but How Can They Stop It?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the current economic un-
certainty, Washington econo-
mists are facing a dilemma of
their own making. The Presi-
dent's economic advisers, the
compilers of the cost-of-living
index and the prophets of the
Commerce Department taught
a large part of the country to
look to Washington for advice
on future economic conditions.
At the same time, it is now
realized in Washington that the
extent to which its predictions
are believed will greatly influ-
ence the buying and selling hab-
its of people and thus produce
more than prophecy. The eco-
nomic prophet can, if believed,
become a means of actually mak-
ing economic weather. Right
now, Washington economists
are afraid they may prophesy
us into a real recession and
hence are increasingly cautious
about offhand interpretations of
their figures.
For example, they admit that
the cost of living may continue
the "slide"—that is how they
put it. They are then faced with
the question—as they were at
last week's meeting of the Re-
tailers' Advisory Council—of
what retailers should say to anx-
ious and reluctant customers.
In short, what is to be said to
people who are thinking about
waiting for lower prices?
Two answers have been sug-
gested. One is that prices can
hardly be expected to slide a
great deal, because fixed costs
are still high. Freight rates,
taxes and labor contracts can
hardly shrink much. Another
point is that if too many people
hesitate to buy they may bring
on a real depression in which
they will have nothing to buy
with. The latter point is true,
but the individualistic American
seldom will act upon it.

It might be added here that
it was the President himself
who promised lower prices if
he were elected. Hence he might,
if the reasoning above be true,
be the real cause of the "slide."
Washington is also greatly
worried about the beginning of
another series of strikes. If the
Ford strike is long and costly,
and if other big strikes follow,
the result might be a much more
rapid decline in economic con-
ditions.
But the political entangle-
ments of the administration in
Washington make it difficult to
do much about strikes. Walter
Reuther is said to have assured
Washington that he can keep
things in hand and control the
radicals. Philip Murray wants
something for his steelworkers,
despite a two-year contract.
Meanwhile, the administra-
tion is worried about the impact
of this domestic situation on
foreign affairs. It is quite clear
that the Soviet, which has been
praying for an American depres-
sion, is exceedingly anxious to
see a big wave of strikes take
place just as general business is
easing.
The effect, they realize, would
be much more dangerous to us
than it was two or three years
ago, when there was a large
pent-up demand for goods. And
so we can be sure, as Washing-
ton is sure, that the radicals in
the big unions—notably in the
big Ford local of the UAW—
are not sorry to precipitate a
real decline.
