Welfare State
Is the Election
Issue of 1950
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Speaker Sam Rayburn and
Senate Majority Leader Scott
Lucas in a radio broadcast have
addressed themselves to the
various criticisms leveled at
the 81st Congress.
Between the two points of
their answer there is an element
of inconsistency. They said,
first, that this session will pro-
duce as constructive a record
as anyone could desire. They
said, second, that while Con-
gress has failed in enacting the
Truman Fair Deal program, it
has put its members on record
and the whole matter will be
put to the voters in 1950.

It can hardly be claimed that
the word "constructive" should
be applied to a session that
failed to support the President's
program. It would seem that
the record is purely negative,
since the result was merely to
show how many Democrats
have no confidence in the ma-
jor campaign promises of 1948.
The 81st Congress, however,
has been most useful in that
it has drawn the issues between
the parties more clearly than
has been done at any time
since the war.

When I was in California
recently, a Republican whose
inclinations run to a modified
form of statism rather impa-
tiently said, "I hear a lot of
complaint about a so-called wel-
fare state. Well, what is the
welfare state and what's
the matter with it?"
The answer can be given by
a simple enumeration of the
many proposals in this Congress
made either by Truman himself
or by Senators like Murray,
Humphreys, Kilgore and Pep-
per with Presidential endorse-
ment. Add them up and you
have the welfare state. Among
them are:
The Brannan farm plan,
which in its entirety would be
state controlled and supported
agriculture.
The Murray et al. govern-
ment medicine plan, which
would take over most of the
freedom of the medical profes-
sion and of most private enter-
prises in co-operative health
activities.
The Murray industrial plan,
which would move the govern-
ment into great segments of
private manufacturing.
The group of proposed river
authorities, which would set
great Federal monopolies over
State and local government.
Federal aid to education,
which would drive a national
wedge into local direction and
control of public schools.
Federal housing on a super
scale.
Enormously expanded social
security.
Wage fixing by such Pres-
idential commissions as the
present steel fact-finding board.
★
All together, not only would
these proposals create a so-
cialistic state, but the expend-
itures involved would crush tax
resources and all but eliminate
private savings by inflationary
spending.
The Fair Deal has created the
issue for 1950. The Republican
Party can accept this challenge;
or it can as in the past com-
promise its position by accept-
ing it in principle while
opposing it in generalities.
