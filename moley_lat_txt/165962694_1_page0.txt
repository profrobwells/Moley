Socialist Experiment Proves
Too Expensive for Britain
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sir Stafford Cripps' descrip-
tion of England's economic
plight is a piece of bitter irony.
He has discovered what his
Labor Party should have known
when they won the election
five years ago-that mere work
by government-protected work-
ers will not sustain a trading
nation in a buyer's market.
Since the Labor Party was
strong on economic theory but
weak in business experience, it
was not prepared for a rapidly
reviving world.
Cripps points out that Eng-
land's reserves, which might
roughly be called working cap-
ital, are declining because Eng-
land cannot sell enough stuff to
the dollar countries. And he
admits the simple fact that the
trouble is not altogether in the
wicked tariffs in these coun-
tries, but in the high price of
the product.
The English are well, almost
fully employed. Their produc-
tion is at the highest level in
their history. But there is sales
resistance. This will be well
understood in the United States,
where peoples quite accustomed
to high prices, gaze admiringly
at fine British products priced
beyond reach of anyone except
those with the money to afford
novelties.
Cripps has finally discovered
efficiency. He exhorts someone
-it is not clear whom-to in-
crease the productivity of la-
bor, to institute better methods
and install better machinery,
and to avoid wasting raw ma-
terials bought by precious dol-
lars. He carefully avoids the
word "wages" in his suggestions
to labor. He says that "incomes"
must be kept down. And also
skirting the horrid word
"strikes," he warns against
"delays and stoppages in our
industry."
It is efficiency that is the
root of the trouble. In produc-
tivity per worker, the American
produces nearly twice as much
steel, two and two-thirds as
much coal and nearly three
times as much machinery. The
poorer showing of the British
worker is partially due to ob-
solete machinery and lack of
"know how," and partially due
to the worker himself and his
unions.
The Labor government, fi-
nally awakening to the fact that
the strongest opposition in the
United States to aid to the
British relates to the cost of
nationalization and socializa-
tion, has an answer to that. It
asserts that 80% of British in-
dustry is still under free pri-
vate enterprise. The fact is,
however, that key industries
are now socialized and that in
essential production, 20% may
be decisive.
In any event, the past four
years have been a poor time
for the British to take time out
for theoretical experiments in
Socialism. The cost of these ex-
periments to the American tax-
payer has been estimated at
$2,000,000,000.
Strong measures to restrict
trade with dollar countries will
hurt the British, but they will
merely inconvenience us. The
restrictions proposed by Cripps
are relatively small and will be
only palliatives.
Nor will tinkering with mon-
ey cure the trouble. This is
well understood by the British,
and Cripps has at least post-
poned it. For it would raise the
cost of living in England and
enforce further austerity. Any
advantages in enabling the
British to sell goods for less
over here would run into our
present decline in prices, and
soon the British edge in our
markets would vanish.
The real peril to England is
political, a point which I shall
explain in another column.
