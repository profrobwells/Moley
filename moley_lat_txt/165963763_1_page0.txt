How Congress Should Cure
Federal Yen for Tidelands
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
May 9 saw the opening of
hearings by the Supreme Court
on a request by the Attorney
General for permission to sue
Texas and Louisiana to estab-
lish title to the tidelands adja-
cent to those States in the Gulf
of Mexico. Meanwhile, under
the surface in Washington we
are hearing much talk of a com-
promise on the whole issue.
This column has previously
outlined the issues in this case,
in the California case of two
years ago and, presumably, in
cases yet to come. From Coloni-
al days it has been recognized
by custom and by judicial de-
cisions that the lands under
water bordering on States are
State property. That principle
has been stated in many Su-
preme Court opinions, including
four written by four great Chief
Justices—Walte, White, Taft
and Hughes. Only when oil pro-
duction began did the Federal
yen develop to take over these
lands.
In the California case, the
court, in Justice Black’s opin-
ion, left the question of title
wide open, declaring only the
“paramount rights” of the Fed-
eral government. Both Black
by implication and Frankfur-
ter directly in his dissent said
the title should be settled by
Congress.
Two years ago Congress
passed a bill quitclaiming the
lands to the States. Truman
killed this with a veto. Bills
now pending, of the same na-
ture, would meet a similar veto.
Also, the administration’s bill
taking over the lands and divid-
ing the royalties has no chance
of passing. Thus, Congress is
stymied.
*
All this gives rise to talk of
a compromise. The administra-
tion is credited with a proposal
which would vest title in the
Federal government and pay off
the States with a share of the
royalties for “education.” An-
other proposal, not yet publicly
announced, would give three
miles to the States and every-
thing beyond that limit to the
Federal government.
It should be noted that Texas
has a claim beyond all other
States. Texas was admitted to
the Union by solemn agreement
with the United States; in that
agreement Texas specifically re-
tained “three leagues from
land.”

The compromises mentioned
above are proposed as a matter
of duress. It is the Federal ad-
ministration against the Gover-
nors and Attorneys General of
44 States, plus a majority of
both Houses of Congress, mov-
ing to seize property the title of
which was never controverted
until valuable oil and minerals
were involved. Some 20-odd
States are involved, including
the eight States bordering on
the Great Lakes.
The thing would seem to be
a matter of principle.
This talk of a compromise re-
minds this writer of an incident
in his early life. Two robbers
held him up, and in the course
of the scuffle his mind flashed
the idea of suggesting that the
robbers take his watch and
leave his chain, which was an
heirloom. Needless to say, there
was no opportunity to discuss
matters of compromise. It might
be added that the robbers ulti-
mately fled and that the watch
and chain are still in the writ-
er’s possession.

What the tidelands issue
comes down to is (a) the Feder-
al government’s itch to get some
of the royalty money now paid
of oil companies to the States,
and (b) the Federal govern-
ment’s passion to extend its
power of regulation over the oil
business. It is more of the wave
of centralized power generated
by an administration which pays
hypocritical tribute to Jeffer-
son. Congress should act with
sufficient force to overwhelm a
veto. This is no matter for com-
promise.
