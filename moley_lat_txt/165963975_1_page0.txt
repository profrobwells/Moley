Veterans Will Get a Dividend,
Early Next (Election) Year
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is pleasant and unex-
pected news for 16,000,000 hold-
ers of veterans' life insurance
policies in a $2,800,000,000
bonus, to be paid during the
first half of next year. This will
mean an average payment to
holders of from $150 to $170.
A significant statement was
made in Washington that these
checks will be in the hands of
the veterans some months be-
fore election.
The pleasant part of this pay-
ment, as far as the government
is concerned, is that it does not
have to be covered by new taxes
or borrowing. It originates in
the insurance accounts built up
between 1941 and 1948 by and
for the members of the armed
forces in the late war. Part was
paid by the veterans; part by
the Federal government. The
war losses proved to be much
less than were anticipated in
the financial plans for the in-
surance. Hence, this great ac-
cumulation of funds in the war
years.
Since 1916, this "dividend"
originated as it does in all life
insurance—mainly from sav-
ings made by lower mortality
than was originally figured by
the actuaries.
It is clear that all this money
could not be paid if the govern-
ment should withhold the $700,-
000,000 a year which is its con-
tribution. It would be more
economical, of course, to forego
that sum and to forego
payments by veterans for a
period.
But the golden opportunity to
pay a dividend during an elec-
tion year and also to use the
payment to halt deflation could
not be overlooked, either by the
administration or by Congress.
The economic effect will be
inflationary to a degree. How
much, will depend upon the ex-
tent of deflation next year.
Experience has shown that a
bonus has a noteworthy effect
upon the business cycle. In
1936, a bonus of about $2,000,-
000,000 was paid, and business
improved, especially around
election time. But that payment
came when the national income
was only about a third of what
it is now.
An equivalent stimulus now
would require twice the amount
which will be paid next year. It
may be that a greater propor-
tion of this new bonus will be
saved than was the case in 1936.
For there is relatively less un-
employment now, and we have
just been through a long period
of prosperity. The 1936 bonus
came to people who had been
through a long depression.
On the political side—and it
would be absurd to suppose that
this has not been considered—
the pattern followed by Roose-
velt in 1935 and 1936 has been
adopted. In 1935, Roosevelt not
only vetoed the bonus but took
pains to make it an issue with
Congress. He literally drove his
followers to support him. In
1936 he vetoed it again, but did
little to prevent Congress from
overriding the veto. He calcu-
lated that the gratitude of re-
cipients would be less lively
after a year than after a few
months. He also believed that
a business lift was better timed
in an election year.
The outcome of those calcula-
tions was altogether favorable
to the party in power. That, no
doubt, provided the inspiration
for the present move.
