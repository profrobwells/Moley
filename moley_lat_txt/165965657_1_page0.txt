Truman Doesn't
Know the Rules
of Tax Receipts
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The fate of the President's
financial predictions now and in
the past should make clear to
him that in dealing with economic
forces he is not fighting a
mere Gallup poll. He is dealing
with inexorable facts, not the
pre-election guesses of people
about how they are going to
vote.
From time to time over the
last two and a half years, this
column has pointed out a basic
rule in estimating Federal revenues,
as compared with national
income. That rule is that
when inflationary forces operate
to produce a rising national income,
Federal revenues rise at a
considerably higher relative
rate. This rule is either unknown
to the President's Council
of Economic Advisers and
Budget Bureau or they have ignored
it, because the President's
January estimates of income
have for the last three years
been ridiculously low. In one
year he missed by 26% and in
another by 16%.
NEXT YEAR'S PROSPECT
The rule operates in reverse,
of course, when the national income
is declining. Federal revenues
then decline at a considerably
faster relative rate.
Against this background, and
taking account of current economic
facts, let us see what will
happen to the President's estimates
for this year and the
next. He estimated that for the
year ending June 30, 1949—that
is, "fiscal '49"—there will be a
deficit of $600,000,000. For the
next year, "fiscal '50," he estimates
another deficit, $873,000,000.
On the basis of the rule, the
deficit for fiscal '49 will not appear,
because the inflationary
tide of 1948 will appear to have
swept on into the early weeks
of this calendar year. The real
blow, however, will fall upon fiscal
'50 when, if the present
downward turn in national income
continues, Federal revenues
will sharply decline. The
probable deficit will greatly exceed
the estimate.
WISHFUL THINKING
The Journal of Commerce of
New York reports that the Departments
of Commerce and
Agriculture are drastically revising
their figures on farm income.
Instead of an income at
an annual rate of $25,100,000,000,
as first estimated, the figure
is really about $2,000,000,000
less.
The Department of Commerce
is learning that instead of national
personal income at a rate
of $220,000,000,000, the figure
should now be estimated at a
considerably lower level.
The SEC at the same time reports
a sizable drop in liquid
savings by individuals.
A decline in national income
will certainly be felt in tax receipts
from here on. Increasing
tax rates can be no remedy for
this situation, because such an
increase, as Sen. George says,
will simply accelerate the deflationary
forces now in operation.
Only a sharp revision of the
Truman proposals for spending
can prevent a deficit or reduce
the size of the one which will
certainly appear.
It might be added that even
in the President's Council of
Economic Advisers there are
private opinions that unemployment
will rise to 4,000,000 in the
fall and 6,000,000 next year.
