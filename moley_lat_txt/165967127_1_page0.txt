Papers Report Red Trials
With Commendable Restraint
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is hardly necessary to note
the importance of and public
interest in the three trials in-
volving Communism that have
been in the papers. One of them
-the trial of the Communist
leaders before Federal Judge
Medina-has been going on
slowly for months. The Hiss
and Coplon trials have been
shorter, but in a sense more
important to Americans con-
cerned about the integrity of
our government.
*
These trials have been re-
ported in the press in some
detail. So far as my reading of
papers is concerned, the cover-
age has been fair, ample and
exceedingly restrained. This is
the more remarkable because
of the unremitting campaign
against Communism-domestic
and foreign-that has gone on
in the press since the end of the
war.
It is remarkable since so
much of the press is antiad-
ministration, and the President
has taken the attitude that the
claims of subversive activities
in government are largely "red
herrings." The Hiss and Coplon
trials are the first real tests of
these claims, and it would be
natural for papers that have
expressed opinions on the sub-
ject to want these defendants
to be proved guilty.
In the foregoing I have been
referring to the news columns.
Editorial pages have been al-
most completely silent during
the progress of the trials, which
is in pursuance of the best of
newspaper tradition.
Since this restraint in com-
ment is so well known in news-
paper offices, little attention
has been drawn to it directly.
For the general public it de-
serves some spelling out.
*
There have been numerous
battles over newspaper com-
ment during trials in the past
years between judges and news-
papers. A number of contempt
proceedings have been insti-
tuted by irate judges. These
battles have generally been won
by the press.
The restraint in these recent
and current trials has not been
due to fear of the judges, how-
ever. It has undoubtedly been
due to a self-imposed code by
the press itself.
In the old days of the press,
slashing, prejudiced editorials
were leveled at defendants,
prosecutors and judges. These,
it came to be realized, created
an atmosphere in which juries
were directly or indirectly in-
fluenced. A jury can never be
completely isolated from a pre-
vailing public opinion, even
when it is denied access to the
papers. Therefore, whatever
tends to create a public opinion
operates against the fairness of
the trial. And hence the re-
straint now practiced almost
universally.
Consider this press restraint
and the general faith of the
American people in their courts
on the background of what
would have happened to Coplon
and Hiss in Russia. Perhaps
there would have been no trials
at all.
