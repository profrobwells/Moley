As World's General Store,
England Needs Customers
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sir Stafford Cripps, British
Chancellor of the Exchequer, in
his long statement about Eng-
land's financial troubles, has
made it clear that the hopes
for recovery that his predeces-
sors in government had held
four or five years ago have not
materialized.
Our big loan of nearly four
years ago lasted less than two
years. Meanwhile, we have tak-
en over the cost of the British
zone in Germany and are pay-
ing between $1,000,000,000 and
$1,500,000,000 to England under
the Marshall Plan. The general
idea was that our help could
end in 1952.
*
But, says the British weekly,
the Economist, "1952 is now."
This does not mean that the
self-sufficiency that England an-
ticipated for 1952 has come, but
that the crisis expected in that
year has arrived and England
is not prepared for it.
It means that England has
reached a point where, even
with the Marshall Plan money
and everything else we have
done, she faces a crisis almost
as serious as she faced before
we extended our help.
Putting aside for the moment
the complicated problems of
money exchange let us look at
the situation in terms of goods.
England traditionally has been
to a large part of the world
what a county seat or small
city used to be to a rural area
in our Middle West—where
farmers brought grain to a mill
and flour and "middlings" and
other products were returned;
where farmers deposited money
and got loans from banks;
where manufactured articles
could be bought.

England was more than the
world's general store, because it
made goods as well as traded in
goods. Like the cities described
by William Jennings Bryan,
England could not of itself sup-
port its people. Cut if off from
the world, and it would starve.
Its convenient location and its
cheap seagoing transportation
gave it a trading advantage.
And it had an intelligent, indus-
trious people with many great
technical skills. Ita bankers
know money, and its traders
were shrewd and progressive.
At the end of the war Eng-
land was assured that it still
had all these advantages and
that, despite the fact that it
was pretty well "broke," with
the help of some borrowed
money the wheels would again
turn, money would flow in and
things would be as they were.
But Cripps and others tell us
that recovery has not taken
place, despite the loans and de-
spite great self-denial.
Much of what Cripps has to
say deals with England's di-
minishing reserves of gold and
dollars. This is roughly the na-
tion's working capital. We are
paying into the capital some-
thing like $100,000,000 a month.
But the British reserve, be-
cause of the necessity of im-
porting costly food and raw ma-
terials, is nevertheless going
down more than $100,000,000 a
month. Cripps says that for
safety the reserve should be
$2,000,000,000. It is now about
$1,500,000,000, and sinking.
★
To stop this drain, one or
both of two courses are indi-
cated: to import less and ex-
port more. Cripps makes it clear
that these courses, so far as
stopping the reserve decline is
concerned, apply to trading
with "dollar" countries. Lead-
ers among these countries are
the United States, Canada and
Switzerland. Belgium and Por-
tugal are partially "dollar"
countries.
To give up trade with the
"dollar" countries and trade
only with sterling countries
would be fatal to England. Such
economic insulation was pos-
sible in Hitler's Germany large-
ly because it reverted to hi-
lateral trading and because it
could with some ingenuity feed
itself. That would be impossible
in England's case. The prosper-
ous storekeeper must have trade
with prosperous customers. The
validity of Cripps' other alter-
natives will be the subject of
another column.
