Dr. Varga Takes a Second
Look at Capitalist Recovery
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From time to time over the
past five years there have been
noted in this column the ideas
and writings of Dr. Eugen S.
Varga, Soviet economist. For
a long time Varga dominated
the economic soothsayers of
the Kremlin and provided facts
and figures for the politicians.
In the middle of the war,
it was Varga who announced
the reparations terms that
later were presented officially
by Molotov. After the war,
Varga wrote a book that cor-
rected some of the Marxian
dogma about the decline of
capitalism.
*
As I understood it, he said,
rather bluntly, that we were
not necessarily headed for dis-
aster and that capitalism still
had some life left in its de-
cadent bones. Soon after this
heresy appeared, a great hul-
labaloo arose among Soviet
economic wizards, and a grand
Inquisition was held.
This was a meeting of the
learned council of the Economic
Institute of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences. What went on sug-
gested the convocation of hair-
splitting at the trial of Galileo.
The result was a partial un-
frocking of High Priest Varga
who, like Galileo, recanted his
errors.
*
Some of the tongue that must
have been in his cheek on that
occasion now appears in his new
article, which is translated into
English in the current Digest
of the Soviet Union. Varga
sticks to his facts but repudiates
his interpretations. These in-
terpretations follow the Soviet
decision to root out "cosmo-
politanism," "objectivism," and
"apoliticalism." He says that
perhaps he has been a little too
"cosmopolitan," whatever he
means by that.
He says, further, that his idea
that Communists should collab-
orate in reconstruction abroad
was a mistake. Communists
who did so and joined govern-
ments where reconstruction was
going on found that, despite
their influence, the bourgeois
framework of such states re-
mained. And when those who
thus collaborated tried to take
over, they were pitched out of
office into the streets or into
jail. This seems to have caused
Varga to believe that other
tactics were in order.
*
The major aim, he seems to
believe now, is Soviet "im-
perialistic expansion" in the
economic field. Presumably,
this means to build better
mouse traps in Russia and sell
them to satellite states.
He notes that the Marshall
Plan is having its effect in West-
ern Europe and that it must be
recognized. To further this re-
ognition he plans to write an-
other book telling how Russia
can take these new forces into
account and still further Com-
munist revolutionary purposes.
It is quite apparent that
Varga sees that he can stay
out of a concentration camp
only by sliding into language
that few westerners and prob-
ably few Russians can under-
stand. In any event, it is pos-
sible that by the time his next
book is written, Western Europe
will be well on the way to re-
habilitation.
*
All that we need note in the
new Varga thesis is that the
Soviets have decided that they
cannot take over in Western
Europe, but that they intend to
continue to annoy us with spies
and propaganda. The purpose of
these activities apparently is
not to take over government,
here or anywhere else, but to
divert our attention from our
own economic development.
Perhaps if we continue our
preoccupation with such mat-
ters, we will be doing exactly
what they want us to do.
