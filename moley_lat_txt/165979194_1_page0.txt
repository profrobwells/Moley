What's Wrong With England?
An Installment Explanation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It hardly needs to be argued
that the American people have
a profound concern for Great
Britain and the British people.
That has been proved in two
wars and many years of peace.
But if any further proof were
necessary, we have it in the
willingness of the American tax-
payer to give almost unlimited
sums to Britain for a purpose
that not one American in 10,000
understands.
This is no reflection on our
general intelligence, because we
are probably as smart as any
people in the world. But inter-
national trade and foreign ex-
change have always been of
importance to only a tiny
minority of our people. That
tiny minority, including a lot of
bankers, know so much that
they speak a language on these
subjects which is unintelligible
to the man in the street.
★
The importance of making it
clear what our money is doing
for England was never so great,
because that formerly great
nation is really looking ruin in
the face: and if chaos comes
there, it may cost us a lot more.
It might be well if those who do
understand these problems
would exert themselves a bit to
enlighten us all.
I am not sure that I under-
stand the subject, although a
few years ago I had a series of
excellent practical lessons. But
for the sake of contributing to
understanding, I should like to
spell out Britain's problem in
this and a succeeding column or
two.
★
The tight little island of
England, Scotland and Wales
had a very good time of it for a
century or more. Its land wasn't
worth much and the population
was-and is-too large. Its
manufacturing industries were
relatively efficient until the end
of the 19th century. Since then,
British industry has been fall-
ing behind.
The British people, however,
made a good living and enjoyed
a high standard of life, largely
because England had accumu-
lated much capital which was
invested in productive enter-
prises all over the world. The
interest on those investments
came back home, and with that
money England could buy goods
everywhere. Probably about
$2,000,000,000 of interest and
sinking fund money came in ev-
ery year.
Then in 1939 came the war-
the most expensive war in his-
tory. It was necessary not only
to use up all the interest, but
to sell almost all the property
abroad from which this income
was derived.
England not only had to liqui-
date foreign holdings, but had
to borrow from her former
satellites-India, Egypt and
other countries.
Toward the end of the war,
the British government sent
over her famous economist,
Lord Keynes, to explain the
trouble to our government. He
did this very well, and we, to-
gether with other countries, at
Bretton Woods set up the In-
ternational Bank and Mone-
tary Fund to help needy coun-
tries. The United States, of
course, supplied most of the
capital for those institutions.
★
The bank and the fund have
not worked out very well. They
have lent only about 10 or 12%
of their capital. When it be-
came apparent, in 1945, that
these institutions would not
save his country, Keynes came
over again and solicited a loan
of $3,750,000,000 on easy terms.
It was believed that this would
do the job and that by 1950
Britain would once more be
solvent and safe.
Then, after Keynes returned
to England tired and worn with
all that explaining; he folded
up his figures and his charts,
heaved a great sigh, and died.
He was spared a great deal,
because things got steadily
worse. In a succeeding column
I shall attempt to show how
and why.
