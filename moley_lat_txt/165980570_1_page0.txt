A Party Politician Bosses
The World's Greatest Navy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The grave danger of appoint-
ments to high office made only
on the basis of political reward
is revealed in the case of Sec-
retary of the Navy Francis Mat-
thews. This appointment, made
at a time when there was des-
perately critical need for public
confidence in the armed serv-
ices, was obviously wrong from
the first.
In Matthews' long biography
in Who's Who there is not a
single item that suggests prep-
aration for the Navy job. There
is, however, plenty to indicate
why a political party might
want to reward him and use
his services in future cam-
paigns.

But a Secretary of the Navy
must, if he is to be effective,
have more than that. He must
have the capacity to gain and
hold the confidence of profes-
sional Navy men of high intel-
lectual powers and proven ex-
perience, such as King, Halsey,
Nimitz, Spruance, Denfeld, Rad-
ford and a host of others. He
must hold the confidence of hun-
dreds of officers of lower rank
who have given everything they
have to the Navy. He must also
deserve the respect of thou-
sands now in civil life who
have served the Navy in one or
both wars. And he must be a
distinguished head of a service
that is literally the pride of a
whole nation.

For it should hardly be nec-
essary to remind Americans
that from the days of John Paul
Jones and Oliver Hazard Perry
the Navy has held a very spe-
cial distinction in our national
life. At the end of the recent
war it was not only the great-
est Navy in the world but the
greatest in the history of the
world. Matthews was placed at
the head of that Navy at a mo-
ment when it was with every
justification believed in the
Navy that the administration
was intent upon subordinat-
ing, weakening and reducing it
to a mere carrier and auxiliary
service.
Soon after his induction, Mat-
thews stepped outside Navy
affairs to make a speech in
Portland, Or. He was asked the
No. 1 question in the North-
west. Was he for or against a
Columbia Valley Authority? He
indicated that he was not for it.
But when he read his speech
he endorsed the project. There
was thus created the impres-
sion that he was hardly ac-
quainted with the speech he
was to deliver and that possi-
bly the speech had been pre-
pared for him.
In his testimony before the
House Armed Services Commit-
tee last week he read a state-
ment projecting his own esti-
mate of Navy morale, in con-
tradiction to the opinions of
high officers whose lifetime
duty has been to know and
create the morale of the service.
Then, under questioning, Mat-
thews betrayed pathetically in-
adequate knowledge of his
service.

Once before, the President
sought to place in a high spot
in the Navy a man to whom
the Democratic Party owed a
great debt of gratitude, Edwin
W. Pauley. Fortunately, this
appointment was frustrated in
the Senate.
When the dread of atomic
war is over us all, the public
is entitled to thorough enlight-
enment on the points raised by
Adm. Radford and other Navy
men. The charges they have
made have been known a long
time, but because of official sup-
pression they were only fitfully
revealed. That created sus-
picion without enlightenment.
Now suspicion should end in
the light of all the facts.
