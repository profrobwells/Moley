Who Told Us
Prices Would
Drop? H.S.T.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After an automobile trip
from New York to Spokane,
the writer of this piece seems
to be left in no doubt about
the reality of the so-called re-
cession.
People seem to be surprised
that President Truman and his
Economic Advisers, is due to the
slow to note the decline. The
press, however, has been giving
plenty of attention to the Pres-
ident's explanation of the re-
cession and its causes. The
cause, according to the Pres-
ident and the Council of
Economic Advisers is due to the
consumers. Since the consum-
ing public has been so good
to the President, it is a bit
surprising to find him blaming
it for his current difficulties.
It is really biting the hands
that marked the ballots last
November,

In the President's economic
report, the fact is noted which
many people were talking about
a year ago. That is that infla-
tion always has a way of cor-
recting itself. Prices last year
were going higher and higher,
until finally consumers decided
to stop buying and wait. The
result was increased savings
and a turn down in employment
in manufacturing industries.
According to the Council of
Economic Advisers, the reces-
sion began with a decline in
wholesale prices and, following
that, with a smaller decline in
retail prices. This led to unset-
tled confidence among business
managers, farmers and con-
sumers. Profits, which had been
high and which a year ago were
the object of attack by the
President and his supporters
in the unions, began to fall.
They are now, according to the
Council, down 22%. Inventories
fell heavily.
Meanwhile, the income of
consumers remained high. And
as the cost of living fell from
month to month, more money
went into savings. These sav-
ings took the form of direct
investments in homes, farms
and businesses. They also went
into securities and bank de-
posits. Some went into govern-
ment bonds. Finally, this trend
reached the peak of a cycle,
and incomes and savings be-
gan to decline.
â˜…
The one vital thing that the
Council of Economic Advisers
fails to tell us is who told us
to wait for lower prices. Tru-
man told us. He promised in
his campaign to lower prices.
People apparently believed him
to the extent of voting for him,
and we may assume that their
approval embraced his promise
of lower prices, since his avow-
als in that line were more often
repeated than those in any other
field.
The decline came all right,
but not because of the measures
that the President wanted to
take. None of those measures
were enacted. The President's
words are more important than
many laws.
The Council also fails to tell
us how much of the loss of
confidence which stopped buy-
ing of larger inventories of
heavy goods was owing to the
President's attacks on business
and his promises to the unions,
The President, in enacting
his anti-inflation program, has
achieved his purpose without
the help of Congress. He now
has an anti-deflation program.
Perhaps, if he talks enough,
he can defeat deflation without
the help of Congress.
