Some U.S. Business-Haters
Eye Germany as Guinea Pig
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As John J. McCloy takes over
from Gen. Clay the administra-
tion of German affairs, he will
find that, next to Russian rela-
tions, his biggest task will be
to resolve the dispute, for the
most part among Americans,
about the future organization
of German Iridustry. Gen. Clay
did what he could, despite
squabbling among his subordi-
nates and vacillating policies in
Washington.
Recently a committee headed
by Garlan Ferguson made a re-
port to the Secretary of the
Army on the subject. It should
be noted that the most active
and aggressive member of this
committee was a lawyer, Sam-
uel Isseks. Apparently, Isseks'
views measurably dominate the
report, which generally de-
plored the slowness with which
the deconcentration of German
Industry has been carried out.
There is much to be said in
answer to this report, and no
doubt both sides will be pre-
sented to High Commissioner
McCloy.
The dispute largely arises
from two factors: First, the dif-
ference in views among official
Americans as to the desirability
of large and small industrial
units; and, second, the failure of
Americans, and especially of the
Ferguson committee, to distin-
guish between cartels and big
industrial units.
The cartel is mainly a device
to regulate and limit prices
among competitors. It also regu-
lates and allocates raw materi-
als among manufacturers. And
in some cases it assigns market
areas. A cartel is not necessar-
ily big. Probably four out of
five German industrial associa-
tions are composed of small or
medium-sized enterprises.
These cartels have been rec-
ognized and used throughout
Europe for a long time. Much of
Europe's effective industrial ca-
pacity is based upon them. It is
difficult to see how recovery can
be complete without some form
of cartelization, although under
military government the car-
tel as it was known before has
become temporarily almost non-
existent.
The real problem and the
real objective of American re-
formers in Germany is not car-
tels but large and concentrated
industry. Here again, the pe-
cullar conditions of Germany
and of Europe require large
concentration in some indus-
tries.
It is also apparent that among
certain large industries there
must be some interconnecting
links. Steel, iron, coke and ani-
line dye production have to
work closely together. The
crowded Ruhr almost compels
co-operation. In Germany be-
fore the war coal mining was
concentrated in 12 combines.
They were the most efficient in
Europe.
In the electrical and chem-
ical industries it was found
necessary to develop agree-
ments on the massing of pat-
ents. Of course, when these in-
dustries became international
they wielded a good deal of
power.
Our so-called "decartelization"
officials therefore found that in
attacking cartels alone they
were not reaching the center of
their purpose. But their lack
of intimate knowledge of Ger-
man and European methods
made their clumsy attack very
dangerous to recovery in Ger-
many.
It has been suggested that,
instead of breaking up concen-
trated industries, there should
be instituted, possibly under
old and unused laws of the Wel-
mar Republic, strong internal
regulations with over-all Allied
supervision. Also, that in every
large corporation there be out-
side representatives, perhaps la-
bor members, to guard against
the misuse of power.
Certainly the recovery of Ger-
many cannot be promoted by
permitting those Americans
who fear all big business to use
Germany as a laboratory for
their theories.
