Sick Benefits Give Phonies
Their Opportunity to Chisel
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A factor in the debate on
health insurance, perhaps be-
cause it implies an important
absence of human compassion,
has been greatly neglected. That
factor is the extent to which
the demand for medical care
will increase when the govern-
ment foots the bill.
For this reason, the cost of
government care must remain a
mystery until it is tried. For
the real mount of medical at-
tention that would be needed
in a welfare state is locked in
the subconscious of millions of
hypochondriacs.
If, as some of the milder gov-
ernment health plans propose,
the cost is to be met by a tax
on all prospective beneficiaries,
there is bound to be a vast ele-
ment of unfairness. For the
conscientious person who seeks
medical care only in case of gen-
uine illness or threat of ill-
ness is taxed to pay for those
who either imagine illness or
deliberately feign disability.
And when absenteeism because
of illness carries with it some
form of additional benefit, all
taxpayers are charged for the
vagaries or pretenses of a few.
The London Economist coins
a word, "benefititis," to describe
the practice of getting benefits
without real need. It also brings
to our attention a British word
which is not well known to
us, "scrimshanking." This word
means the deliberate exagger-
ation of a symptom which
marks an illness that enables a
person to take time off, with
benefits. It may be conscious
or unconscious. It may consist
of accentuating a cough, a head-
ache, a limp or the complaint
of a pain.
The Economist surveys this
subject in a remarkably tem-
perate article and notes the
great rise in sickness absentee-
ism in royal ordnance facto-
ries in the last year. Since high-
er sickness benefits were in-
troduced in July, 1948, sick-
ness absenteeism has gone up
rapidly in the mines, as well as
in government ordnance plants.
Such absenteeism cuts two
ways. It means still lower pro-
duction and it means a higher
charge on the nation's budget.
The effect extends beyond those
cases in which workers unneces-
sarily draw benefits for ab-
sences due to imaginary or
feigned illness. Because the fact
that such deceit is known to
others, all worker morale suf-
fers and production falls gen-
erally.
This effect of government
medicine has been noted where-
ever it has been adopted. In
the State of Washington it is
noteworthy that trips to the
doctor or the hospital have risen
at an alarming rate since the
government has gone into the
business.
This is not to suggest that
people who need medical at-
tention should be deterred by
high private charges, nor that
it is not desirable that every-
body should consult doctors for
preventive purposes. There is
need for wide propaganda favor-
ing visits to doctors before ill-
ness becomes serious. But there
is only one means of checking
the malingerer or the scrim-
shanker, and that is through
his pocketbook.
Medical care should be am-
ple, accessible and cheap. To
that end the medical profession
should address itself as a means
of self-preservation. But a state
system which rewards people
whose illnesses are phony is
unfair to those who must bear
the tax burden.
