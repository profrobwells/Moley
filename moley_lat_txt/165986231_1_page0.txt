Now That Russia Has Bomb
Let's Not Scuttle Our Navy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The news that Russia has the
secret of the atomic bomb
makes it possible to discuss
more frankly an idea for which
it has been hard to get a hearing
since the war. That is the
question whether permanent
peace is more likely to be attained
when both sides of the
cold war have the dread
weapon.
The argument in favor of that
point of view is that, as long
as one side only has the secret,
there will be more people on
that side who will rest upon
the illusion that victory would
be quick and certain; that the
other side is afraid and can be
intimidated by threats; and,
finally, that the war spirit will
grow because of self-assurance
and that there will be less inclination
on that side to labor
over the difficult problems of
peace.
It is hard for Americans to
believe—It is hard for the people
of any nation to believe—
that they can become overconfident,
cocky, aggressive. But
since we are all human, we can
fall victim to our self-confidence
or self-righteousness.
Now that we know that no
easy or painless victory is possible,
we shall be more diligent
in finding ways to avoid war.
This discovery has dramatized
in a most vivid way for all to
see the fact that another war
under modern conditions, with
or without the atomic bomb,
would strike victors as well as
vanquished with deadly force.
Civilization could hardly survive
it. The ensuing peace
would be many times more indecisive
and disheartening than
the one we have seen during
the past four years. In the
chaos and disorder we, too,
would be dragged down. The
terror of the bomb which now
threatens to strike us should
make us realize that there can
be no easy victory, no outcome
but death, impoverishment and
bitter regret.
A bright spot in the prospect
is that it may be confidently
anticipated that we shall hear
no more from those fanatics
over here who have advised a
strike at Russia before Russia
could get the bomb. Our borrowed
time for that sort of
madness has expired.
On the defense front, it seems
to this layman that it is time
to stop reducing our Navy to
an inferior status. It is no secret
that the Army and Air Force
have been pushing the administration
steadily in that direction.
The personnel of the Navy
has been humiliated and silenced.
Its morale was never
lower. Despite the glories of
five years ago, the Navy has
been portrayed as archaic, inadequate,
almost unnecessary.
But it seems clear that, in a
possible war in which there
would be unbelievable destruction
at the outset, there would
be no quick victory. In the long
period following the first phase,
the Navy would probably remain
the most effective fighting
force. It is not likely that
the bomb could destroy a modern
fleet properly deployed. The
Navy could still reach the vitals
of Russia after land or land-
based air attack had exhausted
itself.
It is time to reconsider the
American Navy as our last best
line of defense.
