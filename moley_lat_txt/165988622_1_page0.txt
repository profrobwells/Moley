"Apparently the voters elect-
ed the Democratic President last
year and failed to elect the Dem-
ocratic Party." This was the
shrewd comment of a leader in
Congress as the fiscal year end-
ed on June 30.
Very few of the glowing prom-
ises made by Candidate Tru-
man have been redeemed. This
is not the fault of President Tru-
man, who has stubbornly held
out for all of his program. Mean-
while, his proposal for new
taxes is dead. All but the first
nine lines of the administra-
tion's labor bill have been wiped
out by Senate vote. Of the Tru-
man budget of $40,000,000,000,
$26,000,000,000 remains unfin-
ished business, and there is a
strong probability that the Pres-
ident will be required to cut
away from 5 to 10% of his re-
quests.

The Republican plan for agri-
culture is still the law of the
land, despite the efforts of Secre-
tary Brannan to secure the en-
actment of a new Democratic
plan. The housing bill has been
enacted. But aid to education,
civil rights, socialized medicine,
aid to backward countries and
many other Truman-approved
measures are not likely to se-
cure final consideration.
In a sense, there are two
American electorates-one for a
Presidential choice and another
for the choice of Congress. That
is our normal state, and never
the twain shall meet except in
an abnormal time such as pre-
vailed between 1932 and 1936.
Since this division is our nor-
mal political status, it would
seem to be the intelligent course
to recognize it and see how
things can be worked out under
it. The President might well
stop talking about next year-
a refrain taken up by Messrs.
William Green and Philip Mur-
ray and Truman spokesmen in
Congress. They must know that,
whether the shadow of a ma-
jority passes from one side to
the other next year or whether
the present balance is retained,
the votes on labor, spending and
other matters will be about
what they are now. Only the
pressure of minorities and the
need to placate them require
the President to keep up this
futile and unreal battle.
The country needs a work-
able government. It needs the
enactment of a reasonable meas-
ure of legislation. Above all, it
needs legislation to meet what
may be a creeping recession. A
stalemate helps no one.
A statesman in the White
House would now face realities,
sit down with leaders of both
major parties and with the two
factions of the Democratic Par-
ty and compromise some of
these issues.
A bit of reform is needed in
the murky political atmosphere
of Washington.
