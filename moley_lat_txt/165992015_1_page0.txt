Dean Pound Makes a Point
on Government Medicine
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In all current discussion of
the welfare state's concern in
government medicine, a vital
point seems to be forgotten.
That point is that when the gov-
ernment seeks to take over the
medical profession it is deal-
ing with values far different
from those involved in enter-
ing a business such as the sale
of electric power or telephone
service or groceries.
It is dealing with a profession
whose primary ideal is not the
creation of capital through prof-
its, but is essentially public
service through the advance-
ment of its own scientific
standards. To assume that
government and only govern-
ment is interested in public
service is to deny the basic
traditions of a learned profes-
sion which, beyond any other,
has regulated itself and has
within itself the means to per-
fect that regulation.

This vital point is brought out
by that dean of law school deans,
Roscoe Pound. Pound, as law
dean at Harvard and in many
addresses before bar associa-
tions, has probably had a greater
influence on his profession than
has any man in his time. In a
current article in New York
Medicine Dean Pound writes
with convincing logic:
"A tradition of duty of the
physician to the patient, to the
medical profession and to the
public, a tradition of the duty
of the lawyer to the client, to
the profession, to the court, and
to the public, authoritatively
declared in codes or professional
ethics, taught by precept and
example and made effective by
the discipline of an organized
profession, makes for effective
service to the public such as
could not be had from individual
practitioners not bred to the
tradition and motivated, as in a
trade primarily, if not solely, by
quest of pecuniary gain.
*
"Nor can this professional
tradition be replaced with bene-
fit to the public by a political
tradition of officeholders owing
primary allegiance to political
parties and depending for ad-
vancement on the favor of politi-
cal leaders.
"Moreover, the professional
organization and tradition are
even more to the public interest
in their effect on the learned
arts that the professions follow
as callings.. A manufacturer
may protect his trade secret
or patent his discovered process.
What a member of a profession
invents or discovers is not his
property. It is at the service of
the public."
*
It is very confused thinking
that holds all callings to be mere
money-making activities. Such
a trend of thought can easily
transform the professions into
unions concerned only with the
personal welfare and money in-
come of their members. Pound
points out the distinction:
Finally, the point is made that
to reduce such a profession to
a group of government em-
ployees destroys its responsi-
bility, changes its essential
character and paralyzes its
capacity for progress. For, he
says, "majority-dictated science,
majority-dictated philosophy
and majority-dictated teaching
take us back to the absolute
rulers whom we set up majority-
rule to overthrow. The service
state is a political step forward.
But we must not let it turn
back upon itself and lead us to
absolutism. There is no surer
route to absolutism than an
unchecked omnicompetent
bureaucracy."
