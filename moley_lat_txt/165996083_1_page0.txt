U.S. vs. Texas:
Moral Issue
in Tidelands
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In Texas last week I found
mounting resentment against
the Truman administration
over the tidelands issue.
The Department of Justice
is still pressing its case before
the Supreme Court. The at-
titude of President Truman
indicates that he will veto any
bill which confirms the rights
of the States in the mineral
resources, including oil, off
their coasts. And Texas, with
the aid of Louisiana and California, is determined to fight
to the finish.
★
This column has in the past
recited the facts in this controversy. The Federal government in 1938 began a fight to
establish its paramount authority over the oil and other
resources under the water adjoining the coast. In 1947 the
Supreme Court went part way
in establishing Federal ownership in the case of the tide-
lands of California. Texas,
however, presented a tougher
resistance, since it enjoyed
treaty rights. But a year ago
action was started against
Texas and Louisiana, and the
States are defending that suit.
The Federal government's
arguments are in part based
upon the necessity of its ownership in the interest of
national defense. The specious-
ness of that claim is fairly well
shown in the fact that since
the controversy first started a
great war was fought without
any appreciable handicap because of State ownership.
Other arguments are even less
convincing. The real issue is
one of power. If the Federal
government can get these
resources, it will have more
money to spend and more
power over the States and
private owners.
★
Above all economic considerations, however, the moral
issue would seem to be paramount. In the case of Texas
a specific agreement was made
when that State, as an independent nation, agreed to
enter the Union. The United
States recognized the boundaries fixed by Texas, at three
leagues from shore, in the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
the Gadsden Purchase and the
international boundary agreement with Mexico. The present
action of the Truman administration would repudiate that
century-old covenant.
★
Even if we assume some of
the contentions of the Federal
government and also some
economic advantages—assumptions which I do not concede
—is it worth the moral price
that would be paid? Of all
things, our government should
set an example of keeping
promises, telling the truth and
living up to the letter and
spirit of the law. The integrity
of millions of private transactions is impaired by government dishonesty. The basis of
civilized living is affected.
This goes beyond money, beyond expediency and beyond
politics.
It is to be hoped that this
consideration may move Congress to stop this dubious
seizure.
