Nixon for the Senate? Some
Feel He Ought to Wait
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Californians are talking these
days about a new and promis-
ing political figure rising on
their horizon.
Seasoned political observers
are predicting a big future for
Richard M. Nixon, Congress-
man for the 12th District, which
is located in the great Los An-
geles area.
He is only 36. After four
years in the Navy, with a law
degree, a wife and infant daugh-
ter, with practically no money
and no powerful political
friends, Nixon decided, in 1946,
to gird himself for a career in
the roughhouse of California
politics. He took no easy road,
for he opposed the resourceful,
leftist Democrat Jerry Voorhis,
who had represented the dis-
trict for 10 years.
★
Nixon was supported by a
group of fervid volunteers.
They pushed doorbells and
aroused the ordinarily lethargic
suburbanites while Nixon
fought Voorhis off his seat.
In Congress Nixon has voted
as a moderate conservative.
His most notable contribution
was his activity as a member
of the Un-American Activities
Committee, in which almost
singlehanded, two years ago,
he broke the Hiss case by dig-
ging up contradictions in the
Hiss testimony when the rest
of the Committee had decided
that Hiss had presented com-
pletely consistent testimony.
★
This was a revelation of real
capacity, which elicited the
great respect of older and more
experienced colleagues. In ad-
dition to his work on the Un-
American Activities Committee,
Nixon has been indefatigable
in other fields.
He is a member of the Com-
mittee on Labor and made dis-
tinct contributions to the Taft-
Hartley Act. In the present
Congress he drafted a number
of the provisions of the Wood
bill, which was intended to be
the successor of the Taft-Hart-
ley Act. In foreign affairs he
was a member of the Herter
Committee which toured Eu-
rope. His voting record has
generally been favorable to the
bipartisan policy.
★
He has shown rare courage in
other measures. He opposed
the bonus and voted against
the first Rankin pension bill.
He has also been outspoken
against the Townsend pension
plan, on which most California
statesmen maintain a discreet
silence.
Nixon is being urged to op-
pose the two-term Sen. Sheri-
dan Downey in the 1950 cam-
paign. A group called the Cal-
ifornia Volunteers for Good
Government, composed of young
Republican businessmen, has
asked Nixon to run. He has
made no commitment.
★
It would be a hard fight to
beat Downey, but the fact that
California usually draws at
least one Senator from the south
would be a Nixon advantage.
Also, it is said that the only
way to beat Downey would be
the same kind of hard-hitting
contest that eliminated Voorhis.
But Nixon's friends in the 12th
District hope he will wait.
One of the men who helped
elect him four years ago said
to me:
"Don't say anything about
Nixon for the Senate. We need
him for our district. If he
left, we might get another Voor-
his."
