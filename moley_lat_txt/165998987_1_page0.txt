Gov. Dan E. Garvey of Ari-
zona has written to the author
of this column, protesting that
a column some weeks ago did
great injustice to his State. The
article raised questions con-
cerning the Central Arizona rec-
lamation project which is the
cause of a violent dispute be-
tween Arizona and California.
The project would, at a cost
estimated at $738,000,000 in-
clude a dam on the Colorado
River above the Hoover Dam,
a pump to lift the water 1000
feet, and a tunnel, aqueducts
and canals to carry the water
300 to 400 miles to fertilize an
area of 225,000 acres in Ari-
zona.
The State of California is
against this project because it
claims that there isn't enough
water to meet the contractual
rights for water to California
and also to supply this new
Arizona project. California
wants a clear adjudication of
its claims by the Supreme Court
before Congress approves of the
Arizona project.
My column concluded that
California's case should be
settled before any action is
taken by Congress. It said also
that, aside from California's
seemingly ironclad rights to its
water, it is better to provide
water for a potentially danger-
ous shortage among the vast
population of Southern Call-
fornia than to restore to culti-
vation great areas of farm land
in the Arizona desert.
It also seemed to this tax-
payer that three-quarters of a
billion is a lot of money to
spend on a new project to in-
crease agricultural acreage
when the government is already
spending billions because of
agricultural surpluses.
Gov. Garvey claims that the
land in question has been or
is in cultivation and that it
needs the new water to save it.
The fact seems to indicate
that the acreage in question
can be divided into two parts.
One consists of 150,000 acres
rushed into production during
the war boom. This was large-
ly a speculative venture. Peo-
ple moved in and cultivated the
land, despite the certainty that
the ground water would ulti-
mately not support it. The level
of the ground water is falling,
and the farmers are now in dis-
tress. Another 73,000 acres to be
supplied by the new water con-
sists of land now idle which
was in some remote past used
and then abandoned. This is in
practical terms new land, de-
spite Gov. Garvey's technical
objection.
The dispute over Arizona's
contractual rights involves the
measurement of water now ob-
tained for many other Arizona
projects. Much of this comes
from the Gila River. Arizona
claims that only 1,100,000 acre
feet should be charged against
its contract. California claims
that Arizona uses more than
twice that amount.
Despite Gov. Garvey's pro-
test, my conclusion remains. It
is, simply stated, that before
any commitment is made by
Congress the Supreme Court
should pass upon the contracts
of both States and should re-
solve the issues of fact. Then,
after that is done and after it
is decided whether there is
enough additional water for the
Arizona project, Congress
should weigh the question of
saving a great and reckless ex-
ploitation of land which prob-
ably should never have been
brought into cultivation.
For with the Federal budget
in red ink, it would seem that
Congress might consider this
huge expenditure against other
and better claims, including
that of the long-suffering tax-
payers in 47 other States.
