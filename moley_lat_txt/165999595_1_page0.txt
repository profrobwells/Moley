Reflections About Byrnes
and What Might Have Been
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is an incontrovertible fact
that if President Roosevelt had
not made a last-minute change
of mind in 1944 James F.
Byrnes and not Harry S. Tru-
man would now be President of
the United States.
It is also incontrovertible
that Roosevelt's change of
mind was enforced by pressure
from Edward J. Flynn, leader
of the Bronx and in 1940-42
Democratic National Chairman.
It is also true that the con-
siderations forced upon the ail-
ing President had little or
nothing to do with the respec-
tive attitudes of the two as-
pirants toward the New Deal
or the welfare state. They had
to do with the carrying of cer-
tain racial and religious groups
in New York City.
Thus, if these matters of race
and religion had not been
brought into the picture, we
would now have leadership in
the White House and in the
Democratic Party which would
not advocate the current pro-
gram for taxing, spending and
eliciting votes through ex-
travagant promises of a welfare
state.
This would have meant a pro-
found difference in the current
government and political pic-
ture. The left wing of the
Democratic Party—the Peppers,
Murrays, Brannans and Hum-
phreys—would be out in the
cold. Labor would not be close-
ly allied with the administra-
tion. The conservative South
would be very important in the
councils of the party. And the
balance of power in legislation
and administration would be
favorable to less spending,
lower taxes and diminishing
Federal power over the State.
Thus, a decision forced over
the telephone upon a worried
and unwell man, on grounds
that had nothing to do with
fundamental political and eco-
nomic policy, changed the
face of history.
But that decision did not
mean the end of Byrnes as
a force in the country, and the
proof is now in a notable
speech to southern Governors
last week. The former Senator,
Supreme Court Justice and
Secretary of State has laid
down the specifications of his
political faith in no uncertain
terms. This means that he has
re-entered the political arena
and, in the great tradition of
the South Carolinians Calhoun
and Hayne, will be the exponent
of the States in their struggle
to restrain the further invasion
of the States by the Federal
government.
He called upon the Governors
as well as Senators and Con-
gressmen, to "stand up and
fight" for the rights of their
States, saying, "We are threat-
ened with the concentration in
Washington of the powers of
local governments, including
police powers, and with the
imposition of creeping, but
ever advancing, Socialist pro-
grams. To pay for these costly
programs we are going to bor-
row more money. It is well to
remember that if we but
stumble there is no lend-lease
or Marshall aid for us. We
will be all on our own, like
Coleridge's Ancient Mariner."
Byrnes, in order to throw his
force effectively in support of
the States, is considering run-
ning for Governor of South
Carolina. He should, according
to present indications, succeed
if he makes the race. No serv-
ice could so appropriately
crown a long record in public
office, from court reporter to
Secretary of State.
