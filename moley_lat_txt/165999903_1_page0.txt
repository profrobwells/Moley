Vanishing of Red Ink Seen
as New Trick of Fair Deal
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Jim Farley was in his
early years as Postmaster Gen-
eral, he signed his multitudi-
nous correspondence with green
ink. He also attached his signa-
ture to thousands of postmaster
commissions in the same bright
hue.
A few years after 1933, I noted
in the office of an Ohio postmas-
ter that the green ink was fad-
ing out. The postmaster later
told me that it disappeared al-
together and that new and
freshly signed commissions had
been sent out generally. The
ink Farley uses is still green,
but it is now of a more durable
quality.
While Farley was innocent of
any intent to deceive, the de-
vice of vanishing ink has in
history been used by less scru-
pulous souls.
There seems to be a group in
the Budget Bureau which is in-
tent upon a much more elabo-
rate plan for getting rid of red
ink. They are no doubt vigor-
ously supported by members of
the Council of Economic Advis-
ers, since Dr. Nourse has left
the field to the left-wingers.

Since the government now
faces large deficts and increas-
ing national debt for an indeter-
minate time, and since genuine
retrenchment might lose some
of the assorted groups who are
now being incorporated in the
Fair Deal holding company, and
since that would be a great em-
barrassment on the political
side, the only recourse is to
change government bookkeep-
ing.
The idea is that when expend-
itures are made for something
that becomes a physical pos-
session of the government-or
even when money is loaned for
a productive purpose-"assets"
are created which should ap-
pear in the budget as a balance
against the cost of such items.
A slight gesture toward ortho-
dox accounting would be made
by setting up reserves against
possible losses. But these funds
could be kept to a minimum by
bookkeepers who would have a
rosy vision of the future.
This deceptive is not new. A
number of spending advocates
just about converted the late
President Roosevelt before the
war.
In his budget messages in the
late 30s there was a broad ges-
ture toward counting govern-
ment works as "assets." No
doubt, had the facile mind of
the President been undisturbed
by the coming of war, we would
have had this system in full
flower in budgets long before
this. But the idea remained, as
in the case of many other tricks,
to be a choice heritage of the
Fair Deal.

The making of the Federal
budget is an enormous under-
taking. It cannot be changed
overnight, despite the success
of left-wing advisers in winning
Presidential blessings. The new
magical formula cannot appear
this year, but it is confidently
anticipated that it can appear in
1951-that is to say in time to
help in the next Presidential
election.
The attempt to draw an anal-
ogy to orthodox business prac-
tices is a fraudulent political
trick. For the investment of
government money in a public
property which yields no return
in money creates a liability, not
an asset.
The idea that such a public
work makes a richer and hap-
pier country and thus should be
balanced against its cost is com-
pletely phony. It might be ar-
gued, if that premise is true,
that an expenditure for veterans
creates a bookkeeping asset.
If this view prevails, we shall
see red ink disappear. But in
the process, government figures
will lose all meaning.
