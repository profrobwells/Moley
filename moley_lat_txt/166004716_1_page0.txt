Truman Pension Stand
May Prove Boomerang
BY RAYMOND MOLEY.
When Secretary General
Trygve Lie bent over the base
for the massive and symbolic
United Nations cornerstone to
apply the eternal cement, he
found that some joker had scrib-
bled thereon "Vote for. Dewey."
Looking again, he found that a
later joker had added, "Vote for
Truman."
There was something not al-
together incongruous in these
touches. For no political advan-
tages were overlooked when the
President visited New York for
the impressive dedication of the
great monument to peace.
*
His route was to the neglect
of David Dubinsky's workers,
who in this campaign are off
the Democratic reservation. The
Mayor, who is running for re-
election, was honored by a Presi-
dential visit to the Mayoral res-
idence. And the President
wished the Mayor well.
In the evening Secretary. To-
bin spoke over the radio for
Senate Candidate Herbert Leh-
man. It was a fine Democratic
day, and good will prevailed on
all sides, even so far as to light
up the dour visage of Vishin-
sky.
In the background, of course,
was the darkening shadow of
the great strikes. The issues are
rapidly becoming strictly politi-
cal. New York's Mayor O'Dwyer
has made a peremptory demand
upon the steel companies to set-
tle on the terms of the Presi-
dent's board. James W. Gerard,
ample stockholder in U.S. Steel
and long patron of the Demo-
cratic Party, has demanded a
settlement on the union's and
the government's terms.
☆
Rumors have persisted that
the government may take over
and impose its own terms upon
the companies. If ever the com-
panies were under government
pressure, they have been in this
dispute from the outset.
It is easy to see, as this col-
umn has noted before, why the
Truman administration has en-
couraged industry-paid pensions.
Its own plans for vast increases
in government pensions, which
passed the House, were held up
in the Senate. On the last day
of the session Sen. George re-
ported that his Finance Com-
mittee could by no means give
proper consideration to the bill.
It covers 200 printed pages.
George promised Committee
hearings to begin in January.
If industry can be pressured
sufficiently to grant pensions
now, there will be less union
pressure on the President to get
his bill through in 1950 in all
of its lavish arrangements.
☆
There are threats, however,
to the administration in this
championship of industry-paid
pensions. The pioneer old-age
outfits see a menace to their own
demands upon the government
when industry is obliged to car-
ry some of the load. The Town-
send people are complaining
that public interest in govern-
ment plans is being seriously
endangered. They also complain
about the economics of industry
plans.
They say that there will be
vast accumulations of idle cash
in reserve funds which would,
of course, slow up the circula-
tion of cash, upon which the
Townsend Plan places its great-
est reliance.
It is easy to see why older
people, both in and out of em-
ployment in industry, would op-
pose these plans. There is little
in any of them for people over
50, and there is an excellent
chance to share in the costs,
especially in coal. There is also
grave danger to older workers'
jobs.
☆
A much more subtle threat is
presented to the Truman admin-
istration in its handling of these
disputes. It is weakening its case
against the Taft-Hartley Act.
Truman is proving that the
Taft Act is not hurting anybody
and that his action in by-passing
it is helping no one but the un-
ion executives. Indeed, Sen. Taft
himself might well ask the
workers and voter's if they know
of any way in which the act
hurts them if the unions and the
President can so lightly set it
aside.
Who is being "enslaved"?
This pension business may yet
in its ramifications prove to be
a serious embarrassment to
those who so lightly accepted
it as a political issue. It is not
as simple as it seems.
