Republicans Look for Money,
but Donors Ask Questions
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among other troubles that
face the Republican Party as it
approaches the 1950 test is a
serious treasury shortage.
The party in power in a wel-
fare state like ours never needs
to be worried on that score. It
has government employees, gov-
ernment favors for businesses,
and other advantages for which
taxpayers foot the bill. This
party in power also has the
well-filled bins of the labor un-
ions.
But a party out of power must
turn to men and women of
means for voluntary, nondeduct-
ible cash. And Republican cash
is hard to get.

James Kemper. has recently
resigned the finance chairman-
ship of the Republican National
Committee because of the great
difficulty of raising funds. It
may well be that behind this
difficulty was the further diffi-
culty of convincing prospective
givers that the Republican Par-
ty has anything in the way of
plans and prospects to sell.
Sinclair Weeks of Massachu-
setts, who has succeeded Kem-
per, is reported to be finding the
same troubles. A number of
men of means and influence
who have been approached to
help fill the coffers have frank-
ly answered that money-in
amounts sufficient to count-
simply cannot be raised.
People want to know what the
party stands for, how it pro-
poses to get voters and what
kind of candidates it proposes to
put into the races for Congress
next year.
The Republican Party is di-
vided into a number of factions.
It has a strong international-
ist group who favor continuing
the bipartisan policy, and it has
a good many leaders, notably in
the Midwest, who would break
with the Democrats completely
on foreign policy.
It has the me-too's, who
would continue to support the
principles of the welfare state
but do the job better.
It has people who believe we
are in a social revolution and
who would outpromise Truman.
It has others who would
break completely with the wel-
fare philosophy and sharply cut
down state interventionism in
business.
And it has its insurgents, like
Sens. Morse and Langer, who
are Republicans only because it
was expedient in their States to
wear the Republican label. In
all other essentials they are
New Dealers if not Fair Dealers.
On the side of organization,
the national affairs of the party
are, like Gaul, divided into three
parts. There is the National
Committee, with a new but sin-
cere and working chairman,
Guy G. Gabrielson, at the head,
There is the Senate group
which has so many individual-
ists that it can hardly act. as a
unit. And there is the National
Republican Congressional Com-
mittee which, under the leader-
ship of Leonard W. Hall, has
more cohesion than either of
the other units. But it can hard-
ly act alone.

Meanwhile, a new session of
Congress approaches in which
Truman will drive ahead with
all the great power of his office
past as many milestones as pos-
sible on the road to Socialism,
And, as in the session just end-
ed, the really effective opposi-
tion will be the Southern Demo-
crats who disagree with the ad-
ministration. If we have meas-
urably been saved from "the
more serious commitments to a
welfare state, it is the South,
not the Republican Party, that
has saved us.
