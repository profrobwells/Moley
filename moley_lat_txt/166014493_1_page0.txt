Budget Proves President
Ignores All Calls for Economy
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The first impression of the
budget for fiscal year 1951
seems somewhat reassuring.
Expenditures are down below
fiscal 1950 and, while the budget
still leaves a deficit of $5,100,-
000,000, this is less than we will
experience in the present year.
The text lays on the old comforting oil by saying that part
of the expenditures would in
normal business be called "capital expenditures" and be
booked as assets.
These are evaluated at about
$4,000,000,000. This is, of
course, mostly nonsense, because unless a capital expenditure is a source of profit and repayment, it is not an asset at
all, but a liability.
On careful examination, the
real picture is not favorable.
We are charmed by being
told that the expenses for farm
support in fiscal 1951 should be
less than in fiscal 1950, going
down from $1,900,000,000 to
$1,400,000,000. The reality is
that the Commodity Credit
Corp. is asking for the expansion of its lending capacity by
$2,000,000,000.

The reassuring words of the
budget message that "acreage
restrictions and marketing
quotas would reduce the quantities to be taken in government loan and purchases" have
already been invalidated by the
announcement of the Department of Agriculture that we
will have the same wheat crop
as before.
In all probability we will
have about the same total
crops in most of the other commodities. At the same time it
is certain that the export of
farm products will sharply decline. These facts indicate that
the additional $2,000,000,000 for
the CCC will not be enough,
even if no Brannan plan trial
run is attempted.
Next, we are going to increase our employment taxes
by somewhere between $1,500,-
000,000 and $2,000,000,000. Formerly this was a budget item.
Now it is omitted.
The President has not taken
account of the over-all economic picture. Again and again in
this column it has been pointed
out that when the national income rises the tax revenue
rises in a much more rapid
proportion. That is why Truman in three successive years
underestimated revenues and
had to revise his estimates in
August to meet the new situation.
The same rule that applies
when the national income rises
applies when it declines. In
short, a moderate decline in
the national income means a
much greater proportionate decline in revenues.
It is not too much to estimate that the real deficit will
not be, as predicted by the
President, about $5,000,000,000,
of which $4,000,000,000 will be
recoverable. Instead, it will be
between $8,000,000,000 and
$9,000,000,000, and the recoverable part will be about half of
what the President predicts.

The fact is that the budget
message neglects completely
proposals for economy made by
various competent persons and
organizations. The most impressive of these have been
made by Sens. Byrd and Douglas. Both these men know
what they are talking about,
and Douglas at least cannot be
accused of being an opponent
of the administration. Economy seems to be generally neglected in the budget.
All this places before Congress the burden of rescuing us
from a grave financial situation which the President seems
determined to ignore.
