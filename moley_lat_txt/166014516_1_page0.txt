Mr. Truman Seems to Want
a New Farmer-Labor Party
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It will be interesting news
when President Truman spe-
cifically names the "selfish in-
terests" as he has promised to
do in the campaign of 1950,
which apparently began in 1948.
Will he include John L. Lew-
is, who through monopolistic
power is restraining trade and
threatening a shortage in coal
by limiting work to a three-day
week? Will Mr. Truman name
the railway brotherhoods, who
have paralyzed a great railway
system and the industry de-
pending upon it by refusing to
comply with a law that labor
helped to pass? Will he name
the steel union, whose demands
forced him to by-pass the Taft-
Hartley Act?
But when, If ever, he does
name the "selfish interests," we
shall have a real definition of
the party system which he and
his Cabinet seemed to be father-
ing on Labor Day. For the in-
terest of the President and his
associates is to weld organized
labor and organized farmers
into a coalition to win elections
and control the nation. Further-
more, the President made it
clear that he intends to be the
head of that farmer-labor party,
thus forgetting that old-fash-
ioned people believe that the
President is the Chief Executive
of a nation and not of two spe-
cific interests of the nation.
A tremendous principle is in-
volved in this reckless and ill-
considered choice. President
Truman has probably never
weighed that principle, although
it was clearly stated by the
founders of the nation and it
has been the guiding principle
of most Presidents.
That principle is that the
President is, as Woodrow Wil-
son put it, "the unifying force
in our complex system." He is
not just a party leader who has
attained power, like Mussolini
or Stalin, but the chief magis-
trate of the country. He is not
just a magistrate, but the chief
magistrate, above all interests,
offering a means of mediating
all conflicts among interests and
classes. He is the only official
except the Vice-President who
is elected by all the people. He
is, to quote Wilson again, "the
national voice."
He is not the shortstop or the
batter or the manager of one
team. He is the chief umpire
who applies the rules and keeps
order. When, as in this in-
stance, he shouts from every
platform his preference for two
of the nation's interests and by
implication denounces others as
selfish, he descends from the
eminence to which the nation
has elevated him and joins the
scuffle in the field.
It becomes very important to
know whom he regards as the
opposition. Is it management?
Is it ownership of industry? Is
it unorganized labor? Is it
banking? Is it that great mass
of white-collar workers who are
hopelessly squeezed by this al-
liance between their govern-
ment and the formers, from
whom they buy food, and or-
ganized labor, which fixes the
prices of everything else they
must buy?
If we are to have a new party
system in which two national
parties are replaced by a farm-
er-labor party and an aggre-
gate of all other interests, we
shall lose the whole value of
our political tradition. We all
shall be at the mercy of a ruth-
less and selfish struggle for
power among the better organ-
ized minorities. We shall be far
from the constitutional prin-
ciple that there is a national
interest above all.
