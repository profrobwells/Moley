Spellman and Mrs. Roosevelt
Both Miss the Real Issue
RY RAYMOND MOLEY
Both Cardinal Spellman and
Mrs. Roosevelt in their contro-
versy seem to have missed the
principle that should concern
Americans in this matter of
Federal aid to schools. That
point is whether education
should be a responsibility of
State and local agencies or
whether, through grants of Fed-
eral money, we are to have our
schools regimented by the bu-
reaucracy in Washington. The
issue is not regimentation by
this or that. It is regimenta-
tion, period.
Cardinal Spellman's argu-
ment is that, since Catholics as
well as others are paying taxes,
their schools should not be de-
nied a share in money appro-
priated by Congress for school
aid.
The Cardinal seems to be will-
ing to accept Federal influence
in State and local education if
parochial schools get some of
the money. This seems to re-
linquish the traditional and
sound attitude of his church,
which argued against all Fed-
eral control of education.
her "an unworthy American
mother." According to news-
paper accounts, that is not what
the Cardinal said. He said she
had written things that were
"unworthy of an American
mother."
Mrs. Roosevelt seems to be
worried lest religious propagan-
da be indoctrinated, but not at
all afraid of political and eco-
nomic indoctrination. Some of
us are afraid that, through the
bribery of Federal grants, a
political outfit in Washington
which has never hesitated to
use power selfishly will put its
ideas into the minds of the
children in schools which are
supposed to be nonpolitical as
well as nondenominational.
Mrs. Roosevelt seems to think
the ancient issue of the separa-
tion of church and state is in-
volved. Her argument seems
to be gathered together in this
curious and logicless statement,
"I think that there is still a
feeling that the public school
is the school that is open to all
children and that is supported
by all the people of the country
and that anything that is done
for the public schools should
be done for them alone."
With appropriate charitable
allowance for Mrs. Roosevelt's
familiar loose language, that
statement still does not make
sense. For her third point does
not necessarily follow the other
two. Moreover, she admits in
her next sentence that, if medi-
cal care is to be given to chil-
dren and the school is regarded
as a good place to administer
such care, children in all sorts
of schools should receive such
care.
It should be added that, in
her letter to the Cardinal, Mrs.
Roosevelt accuses him of calling
