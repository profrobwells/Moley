England in Her Desperation
Might Turn to a Strong Man
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After a review of England's
troubles, a larger peril presents
itself—a political peril. Beset
on all sides by privations and
difficulties, and governed by a
Labor Party which is sunk in
the mire of unfulfilled promises,
the British people might turn
to a strong man for salvation.
Despite their long indocrina-
tion in freedom and liberal po-
litical institutions, the British
people might, under unbearable
privations, lose their inherited
faith in free political institu-
tions. They might decide, as
have many free people before
them, that it is safe to accept
dictatorship for a little while.
Few of the peoples of the world
ever expected to live forever
under tyranny. They accept it
to meet a crisis or to fulfill a
great immediate need. Almost
always, except in wars, they
have regretted it—but too late
to save themselves.
Americans have done it with
less disastrous results. They
accepted a large measure of dic-
tatorship in the hundred days
of 1933 when Roosevelt se-
cured from Congress more dis-
cretionary power than any Pres-
ident had held in peacetime.
The reason British voters
have tolerated Labor govern-
ment thus far, despite its fum-
bling with their lives and in-
terests, is because the Conserva-
tive Party is a poor alternative.
Much of the incompetence in
business and industry is due to
stuffy and purblind private
owners and managers. The
British coal, steel, textile and
machinery plant deteriorated
over the years. New methods
successful in Germany and the
United States were ignored.
Imagination was lacking. The
Conservative Party is hope-
lessly identified with this pri-
vate ownership. Voters could
find no salvation there.
No one within the Conserva-
tive Party except Churchill
seems to have the capacity to
overcome this handicap. It
might well be that a younger
and more vigorous Churchill
could do it. Perhaps there is
enough life and vigor and
imagination left to Churchill to
do it yet.
Will he produce another
"finest hour"? That depends
largely upon Churchill. The
reason it is to be doubted is
that, while Churchill had the
capacity to take over with a
strong hand in war, he was a
trained military man. His whole
life study and experience were
ready for the problem of war.
He has no such economic skill.
All we have heard from him in
the past four years has been
criticisms of Labor, the recol-
lections of great war days and
denunciation of Communism.
Perhaps a strong leader may
yet emerge from the Conserva-
tive Party. There is certainly
no such individual in Labor.
Cripps hesitates to cut through
party underbrush. Attlee is
just "good old Clem."
It is difficult but not impos-
sible for a man or party to rise
between the two parties and,
in a situation steadily growing
worse, to inspire—or shall we
say intoxicate—the country
with the hope of salvation. Such
a movement would be called
Fascist, but if matters grow
worse name calling would be in-
effective.
The possibility of strong rule
under such a man or party
would be increased by the na-
tionalization already achieved
by Labor. These government
powers are made to order for
dictatorship. That is why they
are so dangerous. When Roose-
velt said that there were "in-
struments of power" in his gov-
ernment to enslave the people
under a man with less devotion
to democracy, he meant what
he said. And it was true. Par-
tial Socialism is a veritable pre-
scription for tyranny. Such a
turn in England's affairs would
be a dreadful menace to the
traditions of freedom. But it
could come through frustra-
tion and despair.
