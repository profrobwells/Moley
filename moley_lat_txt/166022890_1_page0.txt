Some Future Trouble Points
in Steel Pension Settlement
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Bethlehem settlement
with the CIO on pensions and
welfare opens up many puzzling
questions which may not be
answered until all participants
in these disputes are gone.
One thing is clear, although
Philip Murray's announcement
attempted to becloud it. The
CIO asked for a definite hourly
contribution for an indefinite
pension. The settlement in-
volves a definite pension, paid
for by an indeterminate contri-
bution.
Murray, following the Tru-
man board's ideas, asked that a
definite number of cents an hour
be set aside in a reserve for
pensions at 65.
In his announcement he said
that the settlement meant 12
cents an hour. This was to make
his members believe that they
were getting the equivalent of
a pay raise. Bethlehem made no
such announcement, and on the
face of the terms, no such idea
is involved.
The notion that a sound pen-
sion system could be based upon
any such noncontributing pay-
ments was absurd from the be-
ginning. It was merely a device
intended to suggest a raise in
pay.
Apparently Bethlehem is mak-
ing a promise that workers
reaching 65 after 25 years of
service will receive a minimum
of $100 a month. More highly
rated employees will get more.
Employees reaching 65 who
have not worked 25 years will
get smaller amounts. This
means that Bethlehem's present
plan of $50 a month will be in-
creased.
It is apparently a pay-as-you-
go plan, as distinguished from
an actuarial plan. Bethlehem
will, presumably, unless re-
stricted by the terms of the
contract, pay out of current
earnings. It may, however, build
up a company reserve for the
purpose.
If it does the latter, it will
have to sterilize large sums out
of reserve which otherwise
would go for plant replacement
or be paid out in profits. And,
since all steel companies may
well follow this lead, the con-
sumer will pay the ultimate
cost.
Meanwhile, as this column
has noted before, the pressure
of the big unions on govern-
ment for larger Social Security
will be lessened. And, if re-
serves are required, the govern-
ment will have a new and large
customer for its securities. That
is what Truman gains.
Let us speculate, however, on
some of the long-term implica-
tions of this idea. What if a
company that makes such a con-
tract goes broke after 10 or 15
years? In that case the bank-
rupt company will pay its
creditors according to law.
What will be the status of its
obligation to prospective pen-
sioners? Will this payment be
regarded as a preferred credi-
tor's claim, as if it were wages?
Also, if a worker moves from
one company to another, what
will be his status? The courts
will have plenty to do in answer-
ing these questions.
Since big companies can more
safely and easily assume such
obligations than small ones can,
and since the pension demand
will certainly spread throughout
industry, this will be another
incentive for bigness.
Once more, the essential con-
tradiction in Fair Deal policies
shows up. On one side it belabors
the A.&P. and other big con-
cerns, while its policies on other
fronts continue to penalize new
and small businesses. It con-
demns monopoly, but promotes
it.
