How Big Is Big Business,
and if So, What About It?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While Congress is in recess,
Emanuel Celler, Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee,
is busy with the investigation of
an old and familiar subject--
monopoly in business.
He admits that he does not
know the answer to this peren-
nial puzzle and, if we may
judge from his questions and
the answers, he is not getting
very far with his quest. But he
will probably take his place in
a long, historic line of people
who have investigated the ques-
tion and who, although finding
no answer, have attained some
prominence by raising the issue.
To go back only 60 years, we
have a number of remembered
names of people who didn't find
the answer. There was Sen.
John Sherman in Harrison's
time. There was Arsene Paulin
Pujo and his indefatigable law-
yer, Samuel Untermyer, in
Taft's time. There was Frank
Walsh under Wilson, and Sen.
Joseph O'Mahoney and his tem-
porary National Economic Com-
mittee in the days before the
recent war.
All these left voluminous re-
ports and some legislation. But
here we are, after all these
years, with Rep. Celler asking,
"How big is big?" and "Does
bigness sacrifice efficiency?"
To a large degree the people
who argue against business use
probabilities and possibilities
and legalistic cliches, rather
than facts.
Psychological propositions al-
so arise, as in the case of the
late Justice Brandeis' assertion
that bigness is a curse. It was
Brandeis' contention that, be-
yond a certain point, the mana-
ger, being a human animal, is
unable to manage efficiently. He
is limited by his mental capac-
ities.
No specific size was ever men-
tioned, but once when this writ-
er asked a Brandeis disciple
how big an automobile business
should be he mentioned one of
the smaller but successful com-
panies. All companies, he said,
should be cut up into that spe-
cific size. I suggested that to do
that would require iron regi-
mentation by government. Busi-
nesses would be fitted to a Pro-
crustean bed and, as in the
legend, their legs would be cut
off if they protruded beyond the
footboard. That, it may be con-
cluded, would require a very
big and very powerful govern-
ment.
Then who would be compe-
tent to run a supergovernment,
if a human being is incapable
of managing a large business?
The answer to that has been
and is being supplied by this ad-
ministration and the one which
preceded it. The answer is
whichever orator can be elected
in a Presidential election, in
which efficiency is scarcely ever
an issue.
Meanwhile, as Celler searches
for his answer, his party boss,
the President, builds bigness on
all sides. A pension plan is
forced upon industry which
only a big and heavily fortified
company can adopt. A TVA is
operating in which government
sitting over vast public busi-
ness is run by a small commit-
tee. A Columbia Valley Au-
thority is proposed to run the
major economic affairs of at
least five States by three dicta-
tors.
And gigantic labor combines
are the allies and supporters
of the White House.
The answer to the Celler
question is that in politics it is
only the other fellow's bigness
that is bad.
