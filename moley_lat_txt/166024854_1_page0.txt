Businessmen Are Warned
of Politically Decisive Year
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gen. Eisenhower was well
advised to select Texas to
make his most forthright state-
ment on the subject of govern-
ment regimentation and deficit
financing. For this State,
which cherishes most abun-
dantly the old virtues of self-
reliance and personal initia-
tive, is deeply disturbed about
present socialistic trends. The
response to Eisenhower's ap-
peal was tremendous.
My own travels at this time,
with stopovers in three States,
have reinforced my impres-
sion that next year will be one
of the most politically decisive
in American history. The Tru-
man program is fairly well ap-
prehended. The powerful and
ruthless Federal machinery
throughout the nation will be
used to push it in the fall elec-
tions. And there is doubt and
discouragement among con-
servative people in both the
North and South about the ca-
pacity of the Republican Party
to stem the tide.
Two points have been re-
peatedly made in the course of
my contacts not only in Texas
but in Kansas and Illinois.
They are well worth reciting
here.
The first: that the rank and
file of American businessmen
are not sufficiently energetic
and courageous in their atti-
tude toward politics. They
realize that their vital inter-
ests are endangered by the
Truman program. They also
realize that the sponsors of
that program, including the
political arms of the labor un-
ions, the PAC and the corre-
sponding agency in the AFL,
are out in the open, well
financed and skilled in their
appeal. But they are afraid
of energizing themselves in be-
half of an alternative program
or for opposition candidates.
True, they give money to
candidates occasionally and
support good-government
movements and listen with in-
terest mingled with fear and
despair to speeches at their
business associations. But it
is pointed out that they fail to
go out in their districts and
States actively to unite the op-
position, reach the rank and
file with the arguments and or-
ganize effective political forces
inside and outside the party.
It is further pointed out
that, while business corpora-
tions are handicapped in many
ways in political activity be-
cause of fear of unions and of
government reprisal, there is
nothing to prevent individuals
from exercising to the full
their rights as American citi-
zens.
The other point that has
been made is the need for a
nonpartisan but political agen-
cy on a national scale to fur-
ther the efforts of people on
the local level. Such an agen-
cy should be a clearinghouse
and center of inspiration and
information for local activi-
ties. The Truman program is
backed by a coalition. Its op-
position, it is pointed out,
should profit by that example.
