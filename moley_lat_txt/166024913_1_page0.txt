Asa V. Call and the Citizen
With Shrinking Savings
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two documents lie upon this
desk as this column is written.
One is a letter from a reader.
The other is a notable speech
by Asa V. Call, president of the
Life Insurance Association of
America. Together they reveal,
first, the fact and, next, the
principle involved when a gov-
ernment lives on borrowed
money.
The man who wrote the let-
ter went to work 59 years ago,
at the age of 12. He was a
wage earner. He "saved a
nickel here and a dime there,"
and finally, at the age of 30,
with his savings and an addi-
tional $400 borrowed on his
life insurance, he started a
small business.
*
Then, he continues, "work-
ing six or seven days a week,
16 to 18 hours a day with the
assistance of my wife, we
plowed our earnings and sav-
ings back into the business."
In 1938, at the age of 60, he
"decided to let others do the
work and take the profit." He
sold out for $100,000, purchased
annuities for himself and his
wife, yielding $200 a month
each, and put $60,000 into Se-
ries G U.S. bonds.
And now, in 1949, he says,
"the dollars that were gold dol-
lars when earned and saved
are returning to us fresh from
the printing press, reduced in
value." And taxes, too, are tak-
ing their toll.
This man's $100,000, saved by
1938, had in 1945 a purchasing
value of $71,500. In the pres-
ent year that value is $59,000.
And this does not take account
of taxes paid.

Mr. Call, in his speech to the
life insurance people, uses the
hard and correct word "preda-
tory" for a government that
with deliberation and for the
purchase of political power
thus takes away from the sav-
ings of a man like the writer
of that letter who worked 48
years, employed people and
produced wealth for the coun-
try.
His speech points out further
that an insurance company in
writing a policy is in effect
"selling today the tangibles of
tomorrow." Its obligation,
however, is to define those
tangibles in money, since no
one can know what the tan-
gibles of tomorrow will be.
But this whole process must
rest upon the obligation of the
government to maintain the
integrity of money. And this
government is not meeting
that obligation.
It is interesting to note that
the writer of the letter quoted
above and Mr. Call are both
residents of California, because
in that State the spokesman
for the Fair Deal is James
Roosevelt, the probable Demo-
cratic candidate for Governor.
Awhile ago Mr. Roosevelt
aired his views on deficit
spending.
Mr. Roosevelt made the ab-
surd statement that a govern-
ment which borrows to meet
its obligations does exactly
what a private businessman
does when he borrows to in-
crease his business.
The fallacy in the Roosevelt
analogy is written in the let-
ter quoted above. When that
businessman borrowed from
the insurance company, he
gave valuable security and he
repaid the loan with interest.
He earned the dollars with
which he repaid the loan. If
the dollars he repaid were of
less value than those which he
borrowed, he was not to blame
for the difference. And bor-
rower and lender were busi-
nesses operating freely, with
accepted and realized risks.
The borrower could not print
the money he returned. If he
had done so, the government
would have jailed him.
Mr. Call's challenge to the
Insurance companies to oppose
actively a regime that destroys
savings should be heeded. For
that regime is weakening the
whole structure upon which
private integrity must rest.
