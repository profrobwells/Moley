Example of Neoliberalism:
Brannan's Road to Serfdom
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a preceding column I
described the sad fate of the
good word "liberal" and sug-
gested the word "neoliberal"
as an appropriate name for one
who advocates greater state
power. The term "liberalism,"
as it was once used in England
and elsewhere, was applied to
a movement and later to a
party that fought for the in-
dividual against the state.
Most noteworthy among the
theories of the neoliberal is a
claim lifted bodily from Marx-
ian Socialism. That claim is
that the state, by taking away
personal liberties temporarily,
can return them with com-
pound interest later.
That, of course, is not true.
It never happens.
Secretary Brannan has a
plan by which the farmer, in
surrendering his present liber-
ties, can presumably get great
future reward, stability and
perfect liberty. Let us see
what is proposed and consider
how it may end if adopted.
The farmer is promised an
income equivalent or equal to
what he received in the first
10 of the the last 12 years. In
1950 under the plan he would
get the average income of the
years 1939-1948. The mathe-
matical rigmarole by which
this income is determined re-
quired for this writer three or
four days of study.
But under this planned in-
come idea, the farmer is to get
great benefits.
However, since Mr. Brannan,
as well as everybody else,
knows that among all groups
there are a few knaves and
chiselers, the plan involves a
vast machinery of administra-
tion, enforcement and penal-
ties. This is to be operated by
the Secretary of Agriculture.
The Brannan bill runs to about
86 pages. Fifteen or 20 pages
deal with enforcement and
penalties. One section is al-
most unbelievable. It pro-
vides that the Secretary shall,
before assigning benefits, re-
view the "personal history" of
the prospective beneficiary!
His latitude in this is un-
measured, for in addition to
various economic factors he
may go into "other factors re-
quired to be considered."
The provisions for fixing mar-
keting quotas constitute most
of the 86 pages of the bill. Al-
together, they would reduce
the farmer to a well-kept s. rf.
Ultimately, of course, subsi-
dies will mount on subsidies,
because the promise in the bill
is to keep prices low. Finally,
as in all economic pyramiding,
the thing will break down.
The general economy will not
stand the strain. Or the rest
of the taxpayers, who consti-
tute a very large majority of
the people of the country, will
vote into office people who will
stop the subsidies. Then the
farmer will be left with the low
prices and the necessity to
begin all over to build a free
market.
Neither Secretary Brannan
nor any other ruler can take
away liberty and return it with
more liberty. It is not so or-
dained in human nature.
