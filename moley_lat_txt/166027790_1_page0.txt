Revised Taxation Systems
Could Curb Federal Power
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In reviewing all the means
and policies by which the
march of Federal power can
be reduced, the most promis-
ing is a reconstruction of our
taxing systems.
With the Federal govern-
ment in the saddle armed with
the mighty weapon of the in-
come tax, two results are al-
most inevitable: first, the
complete subjugation of the
States and, second, the social-
ization of our economy.
With relentless precision and
frightening speed, the Federal
government has seized most
of the sources of taxes. The
States, defeated at every point,
have stultified themselves by
accepting handouts in the form
of Federal aid. The amount of
Federal grants in the years
since the income tax was adopt-
ed has mounted apace. To select
two comparable figures, the
Federal government gave reg-
ular grants amounting to about
$100,000,000 in 1930 and $1,234,-
055,000 in 1947. That was a
twelvefold increase. The figure
will be much higher in 1950.
It is putting the case very
soberly to say that this means
a fundamental alteration in the
nature and operation of the re-
public. If the trend continues
for 10 more years, the vitality
of the States will be wholly ex-
hausted, and they will be little
more than colored spots on the
mapâ€”historical landmarks.
The remedy, as well as a
barrier against the march
of socialization, could be a
basic reallocation of the
sources of revenue.
The Federal government
might well assume all old-age
pensions and assistance and
pay for them by its present
payroll and income taxes. That
would equalize those forms of
aid and relieve some States,
like California, from the bur-
den of supporting people who
move in with the anticipation
of larger benefits.
On the other hand, the
States should receive sole
rights to payroll taxes for un-
employment and sickness in-
surance. That would insure
closer scrutiny and adminis-
tration of such benefits and
tend to eliminate present
scandalous exploitation of
such benefits by people who do
not deserve them.
The allocation of the indi-
vidual and corporation income
taxes between Federal govern-
ment and States might well
work for economy, efficiency
and freedom.
The two Congressional com-
mittees responsible for taxa-
tion will again tackle their job
when Congress meets. But
nothing can be expected but
the usual tinkering and touch-
ing up here and there in the
schedules. A major operation
is needed in which the States,
perhaps represented by the
Governors, the appropriate
members of Congress, the
Treasury and important rep-
resentatives of business, labor,
and agriculture might be
brought together. If this fails,
the States might well carry
their case through the adop-
tion of an amendment to the
Federal Constitution.
