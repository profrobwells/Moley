'Liberal,' a Brave Name,
Dishonored by Socialists
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We are all indebted to
Towner Phelan of St. Louis
for a word which fits a great
national need. Whether Mr.
Phelan coined it or not, he has
the distinction of putting it
into its proper context and
giving it national circulation.
It is "neo-liberal" and it means
a person who has stolen the
good word "liberal" out of an
honored past and is using it as
a front for the very sort of
political policy against which
real liberalism was a great
protest.
Whether the word "liberal"
can ever be used again and
effectively by people who believe in what it once meant
is doubtful. The kidnaped mot
has been banged around so
much and has caught so many
virulent infections that it may
be impossible to restore it to
health. But we can use the
term "neo-liberalism" to
describe the mixture of Socialism, politics, promises and
bad economics that afflicts us
today.
Other words have gone the
way of "liberal." "Democracy"
was stolen long ago. Now it
is even used behind the Iron
Curtain to describe the bloody
drama of Communism.

But the greatest loss is the
true word "liberal."
The facts of history prove
without question that liberalism as a political program
arose from a widespread desire to curb the excessive
power of the state. This development of an idea or ideal
of personal liberty into a political movement and, later,
into a political party was quite
natural. For in England the
liberty of the individual could
not be gained unless the individual or individuals—could
get political liberty in the
form of rights such as voting,
running for office and joining
a party of like-minded people.
To make secure those rights,
it later became an accepted
plank in the platform of political liberalism that freedom
from economic oppression was
essential to the enjoyment of
political liberty. Hence, the
measures of social and economic health and protection
that the British Labor Party
adopted. This party and this
philosophy later suffered
disaster, because Marxist Socialism invaded it through the
Fabian movement.
That Socialism is the deadly
enemy of true liberalism can
be shown in many ways, one
of which is its insistence that
to gain ultimate liberty the
individual must duly give up
what liberty he has. That is
what the British Socialist has
advocated and almost accomplished and that is what
politicians and labor leaders
are asking people to do over
here.
No more fitting word can
describe this false belief than
"neo-liberalism." In a subsequent column I shall show
how this works in a selected
Fair Deal measure, the Bran-
nan plan.
