Sen. Taft has touched a vital
point in the national pension
issue, but has failed, it seems,
to develop it. It is probably the
most profoundly vital domestic
question this country has faced
since the Civil War. For it con-
cerns the whole future of prop-
erty and property rights in
America.
Taft says that it is futile to
speak of providing reserves to
pay everybody over 65 a pen-
sion of $100 a month, because to
do so the government would
have to purchase, by hook or
crook, most of the property of
the nation.
A pension of $100 a month
would cost $12,000,000,000 a
year, Taft says. It is not clear
whether his calculations were
based on the number of people
now over 65, or the number who
would be over 65 at a later date.
But without much figuring we
can say with confidence that, if
we are to assume the burden of
$100 pensions in 1970, we shall
have to provide reserves as
large as the present national
debt of approximately $250,000,-
000,000.
For the old folks will be twice
as numerous 20 years hence,
and there will certainly not be
twice as many younger people
to support them. Science is thus
playing a big joke on politics
by enlarging what must be done
to make good on 1950 political
promises. That otherwise hon-
est men who play politics should
make such promises merely
proves once more that political
morals have no kinship with
what is taught in schools and
churches.
These reserves, if industrial
pensions spread more widely,
will not be wholly government
reserves. They will be managed
by political appointees. Indus-
trial reserves will be managed
by people variously selected by
private companies. State re-
serves, if there are to be any,
will be managed by appointees
of political Governors. Altogether,
the people who will control
most of the property of the
country will number perhaps a
hundred or two. How does this
square with ideas of a wide dis-
tribution of wealth?
In the course of time, all sorts
of property will fall into the
hands of reserve funds. Murray
Lincoln in Ohio has already sug-
gested that the steel union and
the farmers buy a steel works.
But, as Taft says, it will be
literally impossible to get the
money, either out of profits or
by taxation, to build adequate
reserve funds. They would in
any case be fictitiously created
by inflation, which in the end
would destroy the value of the
pensions.
The other alternative is pay-
as-you-go, which it is almost
certain will be the end to which
all pensions will come. But the
total amount necessary to meet
the annual bill in a few years
will be stupendous. And since
that amount will have to be paid
out of taxes, deficits and profits,
the inflationary effect will also
be immense.
Since taxes and profits both
come from the same source,
such a course cannot be support-
ed by present ranges of values.
Government will supply the
money by deficits, and industry
will have to raise prices. If this
simple necessity penetrates the
public mind, inflation will be
hastened by private efforts to
hedge. Then, since the public in-
flation will be promoted too rap-
idly, various recessions will oc-
cur. Then people will pause and
reconsider.
Pay-as-you-go methods, if
everyone is to get $100, will
act on the economy almost pre-
cisely as would the Townsend
plan. That plan, it is true, offers
$200, to be paid by transactions
taxes. But the new promises of
the government differ only in
degree and method from Town-
sendism. No wonder Dr. Town-
send feels that Mr. Truman has
stolen his show.
