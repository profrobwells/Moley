During the February cam-
paign in Britain it became in-
creasingly clear that the Brit-
ish people were still quite un-
aware of the profound finan-
cial crisis that they still had
to meet. This fact tempered
the appeals of all parties.
Since the election, the truth
has been coming to the sur-
face in requests for supple-
mentary appropriations and in
the government's economic re-
port. With the introduction of
the budget by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, the facts are
apparent, despite the desperate
efforts of Cripps to cover them
with a thin layer of sweet-
ening.
â˜…
In the government's efforts
to hold voters in line it has
spent and spent well beyond
the limit of safety. Ordinary
expenditures are 25% higher
than those of 1947. Taxes have
been laid on until in some ar-
ticles, such as beer and ciga-
rettes, the law of diminishing
returns has set in. The pros-
pective budget surplus has
been reduced to the point
where no emergency can pos-
sibly be met. The hope for
greater relief through foreign
trade is dimmed by the recov-
ery of Germany and Japan.
Gold reserves are precarious.
The greatest threat is infla-
tion, and its approach is has-
tened by the inflexible tide of
labor union demands for more
pay.
Meanwhile, high taxes and
slightly higher prices combine
to eat into the people's sav-
ings.
Buying votes by free medical
care and food subsidies has
got out of hand. There are
more sick and imaginary sick
than anyone anticipated. And
eating increases as the gov-
ernment shoulders more of the
cost.
The positive assurance by
Cripps that the health service
must be kept within bounds
sounds like election material.
The reduction of the income
tax on small incomes is, of
course, political. That is the
most obvious tax paid by the
Cripps supporters. But if those
supporters could only realize
the extent of the hidden taxes
on everything they buy, this
slight concession would lose
all significance.
And so this rickety govern-
ment starts another year with
even more spending in pros-
pect, with no chance for a real
reduction in oppressive taxes,
with the real value of the
pound endangered by new in-
flation, and with vital foreign
trade threatened by new com-
petition. It is a dim outlook.
