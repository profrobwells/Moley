The extremely Socialistic
program of President Truman
seems at last to have offered
Republicans an issue.
Leaders of that party at their
recent Chicago meeting de-
cided to give the voters a
chance to vote on a clear-cut
issue. As some of them put it,
this means an end of Me-
Tooism—a name applied to the
broad acceptance by Candi-
dates Willkie and Dewey of a
large if not a major part of the
Roosevelt-Truman philosophy.
The exact specifications of
their alternative program have
not been drawn, but under the
leadership of Chairman Gab-
rielson they expect to fulfill
that need.
Everything will depend up-
on that list of specifications,
however. An important factor
will be the extent to which
the plain people of the country
have awakened to the implica-
tions of the Truman program.
Beyond that, the decision will
depend upon the efficiency
with which the organized Re-
publican Party gets its voters
to the polls on election day
next November.
Finally, it will depend upon
the capacity of plain people in
many States and districts—
people who belong to no party—
to organize themselves and
support good candidates of
both parties, north and south.

The decision of the policy
makers leaves many prominent
Republicans in embarrassing
positions. A dozen or so Re-
publican Senators are com-
mitted to many measures that
must be resisted in a real anti-
Me-Too program. Even Sen.
Taft has been forced, as a
matter of self-preservation, to
yield here and there. And Taft
shares with Hoover the dis-
tinction of real statesmanship.
With a genuine party stand
on a new program, however,
and with an assurance of re-
election, Taft can no doubt be
counted upon to contribute a
great deal to Republican defi-
niteness. He has already given
his party a labor policy in the
Taft-Hartley Act.
To illustrate the difficulty as
well as the opportunity of the
Republican policy makers, let
us consider a few issues they
will face. A bipartisan foreign
policy must be reconsidered.
Will the Republicans set a lim-
it to foreign aid, especially in
the realm of economic aid for
reconstruction under the Mar-
shall Plan?

Will the party resolutely set
itself to end the fiction of a
pension fund and pay-as-you-
go? Will the party subscribe to
the Hoover Commission formu-
la to get government out of
the lending business and de-
vise a means by which safe
long-term risk capital can be
got from private sources?
Will the party come out
boldly for States’ rights in
matters of taxation and return
many of the sources of revenue
to States and localities?
Also, will the Republican
Party be able to propose an al-
ternative to the Truman civil
rights program, in which
State and regional authority
will be recognized in that field?
The fact is, of course, that the
Republican position gets very
few votes from northern
Negroes anyhow; those people
of both races who advocate
Federal civil rights legislation
are Democrats.
