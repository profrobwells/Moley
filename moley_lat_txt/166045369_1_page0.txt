May, Thomas
and Morality
in General
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The conviction and sentence
of Rep. Andrew May, the plea
of nolo contendere of Rep. Par-
nell Thomas, together with cur-
rent and sensational trials of
two or three other government
officials, have moved many
thoughtful people to specula-
tions on the old question of
official morality in this coun-
try.
★
One such person points out
that if the number of members
of the House of Representa-
tives convicted over the last
25 years or so is set beside the
total number of members, and
if that ratio is compared with
the ratio of the number con-
victed of similar offenses
throughout the nation to the
total adult population, the rec-
ord of Congress is not good.
It has also been suggested
that crime surveys have shown
that in some large cities there
are something like 10 crimes,
such as grand larceny, reported
for every conviction. The im-
plication in the latter compari-
son is that there are more of-
fenses than meet the official
and public eye.
★
But such speculation needs
to be considered in the light
of many facts and distinctions.
In the first place, a compari-
son of the general crime rate
with the rate of convictions is
misleading, because every prac-
ticed criminal commits several
or many crimes before he is
caught. No such implication is
possible in the cases of the
Congressmen who have erred.
It should also be said on
the side of official morality in
this country that a more blaz-
ing light of attention is di-
rected on public officials, espe-
cially elective officials, than is
true in the case of people in
private life. Officials almost in-
variably have bitter personal
and political enemies eager to
drive them from office. The
press is a watchful and unre-
mitting force. The Congress-
man is surrounded by his of-
ficial colleagues, some of whom
are linked with him in almost
every official act.
★
The fact that no Congress-
man has been expelled from
the House since Civil War days
is impressive. And it must be
admitted that two or three con-
victions in the past have been
borderline cases. In the cases
of James M. Curley and Victor
Berger, the voters on repeated
occasions endorsed them at the
polls.
Famous foreign observers
like Bryce and Ostrogorsky,
although they deplored some
evidence of a low tone in our
public life, noted that very few
instances of actual criminal
actions had appeared in our
history. The record in that re-
spect has been good.
But there is no use in grow-
ing lyrical about official mo-
rality. We have not reached
the millennium. And as the
government takes more and
more money in taxes and
spends it, there will be greater
and greater temptations to
those entrusted with power.
There is also the great cor-
rupter, the bounteous super-
state, which buys support
through promises and bene-
fits, taken from all and given
to some. There can be corrup-
tion through the law, as well
as against or around the law.
