In many former years of
residence in Ohio I saw
strange things happen in poll-
ticsâ€”some queer birds blown
to high perches by capricious
winds. I witnessed the ran-
dom choice of Warren Harding
as a successor to Woodrow
Wilson, and, along with other
fairly adult Ohioans, was
aghast. I saw the native-born
Anti-Saloon League, in alliance
with patent medicine makers,
put into office some of the most
unbelievable yokels that ever
breathed the thin, high air of
politics. But never have I seen
the intelligent people of the
Buckeye State so dumfounded
as they are at the idea of Joe
Ferguson, State Auditor, run-
ning against Bob Taft for the
Senate of the United States.

It is something to move the
pagan gods, idling away the
centuries in amused contem-
plation of the antics of mortals,
to burst into Jovian guffaws.
Ferguson, by any test of
real fitness, could hardly
qualify for the lower house of
the State Legislature. For a
time he was whirled along
into a relatively unimportant
office on a coattails ballot be-
hind some real candidate for
higher office.
This player of bit parts on
the political stage is opposing
a man whose enemies will will-
ingly give him, on the basis of
intelligence, first place in the
Senate. That great writer of
American history, Charles A.
Beard, told me, shortly before
his death two years ago, that
after reading every word of
the Congressional Record of
the 80th Congress, he would
rank Taft with Webster, Clay,
and Calhoun.
What can the well-financed
and victory-sated lords of
labor and the powerful Tru-
man machine do with their
candidate, who must carry the
fight against the author of
Taft-Hartley? Can the alche-
mists of publicity work their
cunning, preternatural art of
changing the appearance of
things? Can they turn lead
into gold?
The best thing the labor
lords and the Democratic Na-
tional Committee could do is
suggested by Philip Porter, the
Cleveland Plain Dealer's
shrewd political commentator.
That is to keep Joe Ferguson
hidden until after election.
Except when it gave him a
distinguished name and a
fine brain, Fortune has not
dealt with Bob Taft in any
spendthrift mood. He has had
to work hard in politics. His
margins of victory have been
close, and his heartbreaks in
national conventions have
been severe. Perhaps repentant
Fortune is trying to make
amends.
