Taft Is Helped
by Weakness
of Opposition
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Four days in Cincinnati and
Cleveland brought out several
facts about the crucial Taft
candidacy for re-election to the
Senate this fall.
The way has been cleared for
fairly favorable sailing for the
protagonist of the Taft-Hartley
Act. The most formidable
threat to Taft's candidacy,
Gov. Frank Lausche, decided
long ago to run for Governor
again.
Several reasons are attached
to Lausche's decision. In the
first place, he likes the Governor's
job. Moreover, Lausche
is essentially conservative. He
is also a very honest man. To
run as the candidate of labor
leaders who call Taft-Hartley
a slave labor law would have
stultified Lausche, who probably
thoroughly believes in
Taft's views on labor.
Another man who might
have been a strong candidate
against Taft, Murray Lincoln,
a farm leader who is also pro-
labor, has stepped down from
the list of candidates. Lincoln's
Democratic orthodoxy
would be very doubtful, but
labor would rally to him. Perhaps
Lincoln, like some other
candidates, realizes that a debate
with the incomparably
able Taft would be hard going.
That leaves three probable
candidates for the nomination.
Mayor Michael V. Di Salle of
Toledo, whose job under a city
manager government is largely
ceremonial and permits plenty
of time for handshaking public
appearances, will probably
try for the nomination. He
would be a strong Fair Deal
supporter.
Another new candidate is
the sociology professor at
Cleveland College, Henry M.
Busch. He is the standard type
of leftist professor with yearnings
for more power for labor,
more taxes on business and
more government in everything.
He would hardly prevail
against Taft. And he could
hardly match the political
sense of Joseph Ferguson,
State Auditor, in a primary.
Ferguson could find his way
blindfolded around any of the
88 county courthouses in Ohio.
He is a prolific harvester of
votes, although his record and
utterances reveal no special
philosophical attributes which
might enlighten the Senate. If
the voters of Ohio should prefer
him to Taft, it would hardly
be in the Ohio tradition of
perspicacity and horse sense.
It is not true, as some commentators
have written, that
great sums of Taft money have
been coming into the State.
His financial support has been
modest, and it can be taken for
granted that Ohio Republicans
are too wise to risk a charge
of undue expenditures.
Ohio people know Taft very
well, and from what I could
learn there, their minds are
fairly well made up. It will be
labor this time that will spend
large sums. And according to
present indications that money
will be wasted.
