Deficit Tops the Estimates;
'A Direct Plan for Inflation'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The twin welfare adminis-
trations, our Truman Fair Deal
and the British fair shares
outfit, now present the high
cost of their experiments.
AS unis column indicated
some days ago, President Tru-
man's January optimism must
undergo considerable revision
from here on. His Budget Bu-
reau, which should have
known better long ago, has
been smoked out by Congres-
sional experts headed by Colin
F. Stam. But the President is
still too optimistic. The realis-
tic Mr. Stam predicts a deficit
in the present year of $6,700,-
000,000, which is more than
$2,000,000,000 higher than was
predicted in the Truman budg-
et message. For the year begin-
ning next July, Stam predicts
a deficit of $7,300,000,000, in-
stead of the Truman $5,100,-
000,000.
And now comes a belated
confession by the Budget Bu-
reau that the predicted deficit
for each year was $1,000,000,-
000 too low. Unless Congress
shows the courage to cut to
the bone, expenditures for
each year will make even
Stam's figures too low.
Meanwhile, Sir Stafford
Cripps claims for next year a
surplus of the equivalent
of approximately 1,200,000,000
American dollars. His insist-
ence on a surplus, he explains,
is "essential in present cir-
cumstances where there is a
constant and imminent danger
of inflation."

In America there is apparent-
ly no such fear. The Truman
budget is a direct, positive and
probably a deliberate plan for
inflation.
In the British budget for
1950-51, there is estimated a
total expenditure of approx-
imately $6,300,000,000. Of this,
expenditures for food sub-
sidies will be $1,150,000,000,
and for health, housing, labor
and national insurance, $2,380,-
000,000. Thus, a total of $3,-
530,000,000 is for welfare
services, not including educa-
tion. That is 56% of all ex-
penditures. National defense,
not including debt service, will
be 33%.
Nothing could show more
clearly the illimitable heights
to which expenditures can rise
when government proposes to
feed, house, pension, doctor,
and in other ways to supply
the needs of a population. Of
course, the people over there
are paying most of this bill
themselves and, what is most
important, the very people are
paying who get the greatest
benefits. A British workman
pays in the pub with his beer
and tobacco what the govern-
ment puts into his grocery
basket. This is Socialism, the
assumption of which is that
people are not fit to look after
their own money.

The Truman Fair Deal dif-
fers from Labor's fair shares
only in degree. And that de-
gree will be maintained only
so far as Congress refuses to
pass the President's program.
For with the Brannan plan
of food subsidies, the Ewing
scheme for free medicine and
several other measures urged
by the President, our costs of
welfare would rise to approx-
imately the heights attained in
Britain.
And since the limit of tax
revenue from large incomes
has probably been reached,
the very people who would
get the benefits would pay the
bill. This is what orators at
the recent $100-a-plate Dem-
ocratic dinner in New York
call Jeffersonian democracy.
