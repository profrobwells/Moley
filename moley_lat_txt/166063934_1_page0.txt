Doctors Learn Own Strength
in Defeating Sen. Pepper
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The annual meeting of the
110-year-old Illinois Medical So-
ciety at Springfield, Ill., at
which I had the pleasure of
making a speech, revealed in
all its phases a new and amaz-
ing spirit among doctors.
The threat of government
medicine has awakened this
once politically impotent pro-
fession not only to vocal and
printed protest, but to exceed-
ingly clever and effective po-
litical action. Credit for this
should go to the American
Medical Association and its
former controversial and bril-
liant spark, Morris Fishbein.
The British Medical Associ-
ation, which I visited in Feb-
ruary, was caught unprepared
some years ago when medi-
cal socialism raised its head.
The British profession was in-
filtrated with Socialistic doc-
tors when the movement start-
ed. Its national association
made an ineffective fight and
lost largely because it accept-
ed compromise. This now
proves to have been a fatal
mistake.
There will be no such com-
promise in the United States
because American doctors are
thoroughly forewarned and
alerted.
Above all, American doctors
who at first thought medicine
was all that needed saving
now realize that if their pro-
fession is to be saved from
Socialism, all other aspects of
American life must also be
saved/
To use the medical terms of
one doctor, the virus of Social-
ism cannot be localized. It
spreads throughout the body
politic. It must be attacked
in all its manifestations.
Hence, to a greater degree,
doctors in hundreds of com-
munities are joining with oth-
er professional and business
men and women to form anti-
Socialist organizations to fight
at the polls against Congress-
men and Senators who favor
the Fair Deal measures of So-
cialism.
On the constructive side, doc-
tors are getting community
councils under way to sponsor
and develop community health
plans. For government medi-
cine can best be opposed by
showing that every good objec-
tive of the Federal plan can
be achieved by voluntary ef-
fort.
The profession generally is
proud of what doctors did in
Florida to overthrow Sen.
Pepper in the recent primary.
Acting as individual citizens—
for incorporated medical asso-
ciations cannot engage in po-
litical campaigns—doctors in
Florida plunged as citizens in-
to the fight for George A.
Smathers.
As one physician there put
the case, “This is a basic strug-
gle between a candidate who
would preserve American free-
doms and one who would take
them away.”
In the 1950 Congressional
campaign, this sort of citizen
action will be felt in many dis-
tricts and States.
