What Was Our Korean Plan?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In a broadcast last week by
Henry J. Taylor a point, not to
say a charge, was made about
which the American people are
entitled to specific information
from the President and the
Secretaries of State and De-
fense. Taylor asserted that be-
fore the aggression in
Korea there existed a military
plan which the President
"scrapped" when he ordered
in our ground troops.
This plan included four
points:
1—The service of an ultima-
tum to the North Korean ag-
gressors, through the United
Nations, to withdraw to the
38th parallel within 24 hours;
2—That the North Koreans
should submit the issues to the
United Nations for judgment;
3—That in case these de-
mands were not obeyed, the
United States and the United
Nations should declare a naval
blockade and attack North Ko-
rea—by air; only North Ko-
rea—by air;
4—That this attack be con-
tinued indefinitely.
Why, despite this plan, the
President ordered in our
ground troops, Taylor says is a
mystery to "many of our mili-
tary leaders." In any event,
the President made the deci-
sion, and the generals and GIs
are doing what they can to car-
ry it out.
However, since it is unques-
tionable that many military
members of the high command
do not believe the President's
course was wise, Congress
should seek their advice on our
future course and, incidentally,
put the responsibility for the
Korean course of action exact-
ly where it belongs.

For there are future situa-
tions upon which the coun-
try ought to be assured that
the President is not going to
override his military experts.
One of those is the question of
where this war is to end—at
the 38th parallel or at the bor-
ders of Manchuria and Soviet
Russia? Others involve new
Communist aggressions in re-
mote places where our man-
power might again be drained
away through disadvantageous
conditions.
Our resources, however
great, are limited and must be
husbanded for a possible su-
preme test with the Soviet. We
must not have our best divi-
sions pinned down in various
remote places of no strategic
value in a possible war, where
vast masses of Communism-
infected natives can take life
for life or even give, as in this
instance, several of their lives
for one of ours.
A President is selected by
more or less popular vote in a
political election. While he has
a great power, it was not con-
templated that he act without
advice. His political supremacy
gives him no military wisdom.
And when he substitutes his
judgment for the training and
experience for which we all
pay taxes, he is not faithfully
discharging his duties.
The adventure before us in
the world is so enormous and
indeterminate, so grim in its
possibilities, so dangerous and
costly, that we shall all feel
somewhat more at ease if we
know that the President is not
likely again to override the
wisdom of his advisers. We
are in Korea now and must
make the best of it. But we can-
not afford many other Koreas.
