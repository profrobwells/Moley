In Memory of McGuffey, the Author of Readers
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the midst of a great na-
tional crisis, Americans might
well pause to note a simple
celebration of a great Ameri-
can tradition. At Miami Uni-
versity in Oxford, O., there
is honored this year the name
of William Holmes McGuffey,
author of the school readers
that probably reached more
Americans than any book ex-
cept the Bible and Noah Web-
ster's dictionary.
McGuffey wrote most of his
readers at Miami, where he
was a professor of languages.
He came as a young man to
that university, which is now a
great institution with 5000 stu-
dents on one of the most at-
tractive campuses in America.
From 1826 to 1836 he labored
over his books, trying out lit-
tle stories on the children of
Oxford.
Until that time, the readers
used in schools had for the
most part been written by
clergymen. The material in
them was religious and
homiletic. McGuffey, who was
also a minister of the gospel,
was a genius in the technique
of education. He retained a
deep moral and patriotic tone
in his material, but introduced
such elements as nature stud-
ies and other material sub-
jects. He also introduced at-
tractive pictures.

His books swept the coun-
try. For three-quarters of a
century they held ascendancy
in the schools. Sales exceeded
125,000,000 volumes. The char-
acter and mentality of genera-
tions of children were shaped
by these readers.
Henry Ford, himself a prod-
uct of McGuffey teaching, was
active in later life in forming
McGuffey societies. He created
a McGuffey museum at Dear-
born which includes a replica
of McGuffey's birthplace.

house where McGuffey worked
at Miami still stands, and
the university's demonstration
school for teachers bears his
name.
Styles have changed in
readers, but McGuffey's influ-
ence endures. The author of
a very popular series of school
readers told me recently that
her greatest debt is to the
McGuffey technique and in-
fluence.
Despite the immense sale of
his books, McGuffey realized
no great material fortune. He
died, however, with the real-
ization that his name would
stand among the immortal
builders of a nation.

Moral fiber, self-reliance and
devotion to liberty, our best
resources, were to a great de-
gree contributed by McGuffey.
Lawgivers and military
heroes came and went in that
era, but McGuffey enjoyed a
place all his own.
