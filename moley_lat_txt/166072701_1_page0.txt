Willkie's Son
Improves His
Father's Role
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Philip Willkie, son of the
1940 Republican candidate and
member of the Indiana Legislature,
offers in the current issue
of Collier's some sound advice
to the public about the possibilities
of the Republican Party.
I say advice to the public, not
to the Republican Party as
such. In that respect, the
junior Willkie already shows
better judgment than was the
wont of his father.
For Willkie, pere, lectured
his party so much and so severely
that the impression
grew that he was really anti-
Republican. And finally, that
party with a convulsive effort
rejected him bag and baggage.
Perhaps his lusty wielding of
the party that once nominated
him was good for the party.
It certainly moved it to a more
realistic position on foreign affairs.
But it destroyed his capacity
to provide it with vital
and acceptable leadership.

Philip, the son, fortunately
avoids the role of critic. He
offers the outlines of a positive
program, with no apologies
and no hint of me-tooism.
The first impressive note in
the new Willkie article is its
forthright defense of the Republican
Party's record in the
first 50 years of its history.
This has been needed for years,
but Wendell Willkie and
Thomas E. Dewey left that record
utterly undefended and un-
praised.
A further defense is needed,
of course, for the Hoover record
has elements of real liberalism in
the true sense of
that word.

Philip Willkie, moreover,
hits upon a constructive note,
which has often been pointed
up in this column; that regional
action through State compacts
is a powerful but neglected
antidote to the cancerous
growth of Federal power.
Such a constructive move to
grapple with problems too big
for single States and inappropriate
for Federal action should
be thoroughly explored and developed.
It could provide a
substitute for many of the authoritarian
mechanisms that
neo-liberals are forging in
Washington under the name of
a welfare state.
Philip Willkie doesn't mention
civil rights, but is clear
that in that field regional action
by the South could settle
the controversy.
A large part of the new
Willkie thesis is given to the
need for action on a local level
by citizens' groups. Such
groups, although not integrated
as a national organization, certainly
can be mobilized behind
the broad purpose of resisting
the Socialist tide.

While millions of people
view the Republican Party
with doubt, they can with local
organizations help to elect
able Republicans to office in
the North and able Democrats
in the South. For the great
task of curbing the coalition
of interest groups clustered
around the name of the Democratic
Party needs more force
than the Republican Party
alone can furnish.
This son of the spectacular
nominee of 1940 has asserted
the rights in his own name to
be heard by the party of his
choice.
