BUYERS'
HYSTERIA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The wise man these days
who wants to anticipate what-
ever price levels may result
from this warlike crisis should
look two ways.
He shoura, of course, scan
the economic figures to deter-
mine what may be in short
and what may be in long sup-
ply. Then he should look twice
at the psychological index—
once at his own mind and emo-
tions, once at his neighbor's.
Then he might well take an-
other look at his neighbor's
habits and emotions.
★
What he will realize, if he
looks sharply, will be the hu-
man characteristic of acting
according to habit. When clear
information is not present, a
person is likely to do what he
did before. He is especially
likely to do what he did suc-
cessfully before. For this rea-
son, one of the greatest meth-
ods of crime detection is the
examination of the methods
used in a burglary as a means
of identifying the person who
did it.
The application of this prin-
ciple to the present buying
habits of the public is clear.
People will and in fact are
rushing to buy the things they
bought before or during the
last war and the things they
wanted to buy but could not.
Hence, the rush to buy auto-
mobiles, auto parts, soap, tires,
sugar, coffee and nylons.
★
Then there are those people
who act on more rational, cal-
culated, and informed judg-
ment, who buy a supply of
things which really will be
short. Their buying, of course,
will accentuate shortages.
Another factor to be con-
sidered in estimating price in-
creases is the fact that the re-
action is quicker now than it
was nine or 10 years ago. Peo-
ple had no experience to warn
them then. This time, they
look at the open book of the
past.
There is also the likelihood
that such controls as are im-
posed will be less drastic, at
least for some time.
All this should suggest that
wise people will avoid hys-
terical buying and hoarding.
Those wise people should real-
ize that a wild spree of buy-
ing may bring on the very con-
ditions that they fear. Such
buying brings on more and
more controls, and experience
shows that once controls are
imposed they are difficult to
remove.
★
But despite the efforts of
wise people to look at the facts
and to avoid hoarding, the
preparations for war that lie
ahead will have some infla-
tionary effect on the economy.
But even an increase of $8,-
000,000,000 or $10,000,000,000 in
defense costs cannot bring
about serious price inflation,
if the public can be brought to
realize that buying should be
guided by a reasonable survey
of the facts, rather than by
habit and hysteria.
