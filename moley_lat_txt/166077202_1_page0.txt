We Ought to Do Away
With Those Crystal Balls
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The prevalence of the irra-
tional in politics was never
more clearly illustrated than
in the case of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers.
The council was created be-
cause Congress could see no
special harm in it and because
Congress refused to give the
President his whole program
in 1946 when he wanted a so-
called "full employment" bill.
As the council continues to
consume more tax money in
its fourth year of paper shuf-
fling, let us look at its history
and present status.
*
The proposed full employ-
ment bill of 1946 was a very
pretentious affair. It provided
for an expert council of advis-
ers to tell the President at the
end of every year, or more fre-
quently, what business would
be like in the future. That bit
of foresight was to guide budg-
et making and everything.
If the council told the
President that there would be
unemployment, he could ar-
range to hire all the unem-
ployed at government ex-
pense. If there were to be
any other unusual things in
store in the economic weather,
he could prepare for them also.
The plan, however, gave the
President so much power,
with so little prospect of an
intelligent exercise of that pow-
er, that Congress scrapped the
whole thing except for the pro-
vision for the economic advis-
ers. This was partly to save
faces and partly because some
Congressmen naively believed
that a master soothsayer setup
was a possibility.
*
Wise people pointed out at
the time that the creation of
this thing was a silly gesture.
It was noted that by the time
all the paper shuffling and
chart making had been com-
pleted in the weeks and months
before the year's end, econom-
ic conditions would change.
It was pointed out further
that in the event such a re-
port or prophecy could be made
by December, the President's
budget would be well on its
way toward completion.
It was also said that the
wisest seers in the world could
not predict the economic
weather a year or more in ad-
vance. And even if they could,
the President's budget for the
fiscal year beginning six
months after its announcement
could hardly make provision
to alleviate unemployment in
specific amounts and in spe-
cific sections of the country.
Finally, it was said that if
there were such economic
seers, it would not be likely
that Harry S. Truman would
appoint them.
*
But the idea made good
speech material for the Presi-
dent in 1948. He had high
praise for it. It was going to
save us from depressions and
unhealthy booms. It was to
be an economic signal room
to tell us of inflation or defla-
tion long enough ahead to do
something.
It has been nothing of the
sort. Last January, the coun-
cil told us about inflation when
inflation was already coming
to an end. The President lat-
er changed his mind, and so
did the council.
So what is the real use of
the council? It should be abol-
ished. A few dollars could be
saved, together with a lot of
newspaper space and a great
deal of false pretense.
