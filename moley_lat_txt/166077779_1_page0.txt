Truman Claims Prosperity;
Who Claims the Deficit?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman begins his
sixth year in the White House
in a blaze of optimism. The
country is in "fine shape," he
says, and the Chief Execu-
tive proposes to take credit.
That being true, he must also
take the responsibility for the
deficit, although that point
seems to have been omitted in
his glowing five-year review.
Perhaps some of this opti-
mism is due to the fact that
both the President and Secre-
tary Snyder are still deluding
themselves with faulty eco-
nomic forecasts. The real def-
icit, however, will be deter-
mined by inexorable economic
laws which neither executive
optimism nor the juggling of
figures can prevent. The def-
icit for fiscal 1950 and fiscal
1951 will be considerably larger
than the President has pre-
dicted. Congress might save us
from this worry, but there
seems to be no prospect of
that.
Instead of the predicted def-
icit of $5,500,000,000 for this
1950 fiscal year, it will prob-
ably be as high as $6,700,000,-
000. For the next year, 1951,
it will probably be $8,400,000,-
000. That means that in a pe-
riod in which conditions are,
as the President puts it, in
"fine shape," we are running
into the red at an average rate
of at least $7,500,000,000 a year.
And it means that under this
optimistic regime the savings
of the people are relentlessly
being devoured by government
extravagance and generalized
handouts.

It has been stated and
proved in this column several
times during the last three
years that the national income
and Federal revenues do not
rise and fall in the same ratio.
When income rises, revenues
rise much faster. In 1947, the
surplus proved to be billions
larger than was predicted by
the President. By the same
rule, a decline in national
income means a relatively
greater decline in revenues.
The evidence of that has been
admitted by Secretary Snyder
who, after tallying March 15
returns, says that receipts will
be $1,200,000,000 less than the
President's estimate of $37,800,-
000,000. But this is only part
of the story.
If we can be sufficiently opti-
mistic to believe that there will
be no further decline in income
and that there will be savings
of something like $1,000,000,000.
there must still be contem-
plated the spending of money
for which appropriations were
made last year or the year be-
fore that. By no law of eco-
nomics can we hope for a real
deficit this year of less than
the $6,700,000,000 mentioned
above.

In fiscal 1951 there will be
further additions to the pre-
dicted deficit. Farm income will
be reduced by poorer crops
which are always apparent.
That, together with general
economic conditions, will re-
duce revenues next year by at
least $1,200,000,000. There will
be a shortage of another billion
occasioned by the excise tax
cut. There will be new arma-
ment expenditures of another
billion. That brings the deficit
well above $8,000,000,000. And
if there is a decline in housing
and in other lines, which seems
quite probable, the figure will
be still higher.
If Republicans and coalition
Democrats want an issue, here
it is. It is much more important
to the taxpayer than Chinese
affairs or the presence of
pinks in the State Department.
It cuts at the very heart of
our economic system
