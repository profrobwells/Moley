Texas' Revolt Against Truman
Seems to Be Gaining Ground
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
HOUSTON—For more than
10 years there has been a
strong movement in Texas to
throw off ties to the New and
Fair Deals and to capture the
Democratic Party.
So far, on a State-wide scale
it has not succeeded. The fight
of the Texas regulars in 1944
was well organized and narrowly
lost a chance to break
off Texas support for Roosevelt
in the national convention
and in the Electoral College.
In 1948 the Dixiecrat revolt
had strong support among the
former Texas regulars, although
the State went for
Truman.
At the present time it is clear
that, despite these checks, this
general effort is still lively
and determined. It is also clear
that political skill in the movement
is growing and that the
national Federal machine will
face increasing trouble. The
people who are most intimately
concerned are strong, resourceful
and in dead earnest.

To understand this potential
threat to the Truman regime
it must be realized that this
is not a mere resurrection
against the Federal civil rights
program. Its principle is far
broader than that. It is rooted
in a conviction among traditional
Democrats that the
Roosevelt New Deal during
that President's second and
third terms, and the later Truman
Fair Deal, have been Socialistic
and inimical to individual
enterprise.
The movement appeals to
the traditional principles of
the Democratic Party—to the
limitation of Federal power
over the States in economic
affairs and to the support of
freedom and enlarged opportunity
generally. Civil rights
enter the picture only incidentally,
for Texas has no real
Negro problem. It is also a
State where the power of organized
labor is relatively
small.
Texas is in a stage of development
in which great business
opportunities beckon on
every side. Young men, notably
in the colleges and universities,
are less concerned with
Socialistic plans for security
than are those in other parts
of the country. They see on
every side examples of large
rewards for initiative and daring.
Leaders in the opposition to
the Fair Deal, in many cases
men of large property interests
and great personal capacity,
are making good use of the
periods between elections to
build their foundations at the
level of the grass roots and the
precincts. In a number of important
Congressional districts
they are helping to send to
Washington dependable Conservatives.
In other districts
they are threatening the security
of Congressmen who support
the Fair Deal. Meanwhile,
they are encouraging revolt
against Socialistic trends in
other States.
There is little hope among
these Texas Conservative
Democrats for the Texas Republican
Party. The building
of that party into a majority
here would, they believe, be
too long a process. Its leadership
is not very promising.
But if an Eisenhower or possibly
a Taft were the Republican
candidate, Texas might
go against the 1952 Democratic
nominee, either by a Republican
vote inspired by Conservative
Democrats or by a clean
break in the Electoral College.
For by whatever means it may
be possible, this commonwealth
will resist becoming a
handout State.
