British Socialists: Disorderly
Minds Striving for Order
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
With endless and tiresome
reiteration Labor Party orators
talk of planning.
They love luscious and fog-
gy terms such as integration,
stability, orderly progress, bal-
anced industry, concerted pro-
grams, price management, de-
velopment councils, orderly
marketing, equitable condi-
tions, conditioned public inter-
est, etc., etc. These strivings
by disorderly minds for an
orderly world suggest a com-
mon trait. A famous American
statesman who was never
quite clear about how he was
to reach his fine objectives
constantly used such terms as
"definitely" and "practically,"
largely to supply the specific
in words which he lacked in
ideas.
Planners quite commendably
strive for tidiness as an objec-
tive. But in the seat of power
they usually fail to realize that
an objective may have little
to do with a course of action.
I am on a ship, and my objec-
tive is New York. But I haven't
the faintest notion of the pro-
cedures which are essential to
that objective, and as a Min-
ister of Marine in a Socialist
government I should not even
be competent to select the of-
ficers of the ship.
A moral as well as an eco-
nomic issue is involved when
a responsible government pro-
ceeds to nationalize an indus-
try when it not only has no
notion of how to run that in-
dustry but even lacks the
means by which a transfer of
ownership is effected. But in
most of the undertakings in
nationalization the Labor gov-
ernment revealed, and on occa-
sion even confessed, that lack
of knowledge. For example,
when the coal nationalization
bill was before the House of
Commons, the Parliamentary
Secretary of the Ministry of
Fuel and Power said:
"It is not for me to say, at
this stage, the precise criteria
which should be applied to
measure efficiency; but it is a
subject which would repay
thought and some of us are
thinking about it."
Later this man's boss, the
Minister of Fuel and Power,
said: "We are about to take
over the mining industry. It
is not so easy as it looks. I
have been talking about na-
tionalization for 40 years but
the implications of the trans-
fer of property have never oc-
curred to me."
A British economist
marked in his resentment
against this sort of thing that
the planner believes "that
time can heal the wounds of
ignorance." But what are the
rest of us to do during the
convalescence?
