Truman Hates the T-H Law,
but Offers Nothing Better
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the midst of a paralyzing
labor conflict President Tru-
man completed his long tour,
with little or nothing to say
about how such work stop-
pages can be prevented.
In his Butte speech he had
a great deal to say about jobs
for all and other government
benefits to be supplied by gov-
ernment for workers. But
when he came down to the
meat of industrial relations,
this was substantially his
whole message to the coun-
try:
"The Taft-Hartley Act emas-
culated the Wagner Act and
subverted its purpose. The
avowed intention of its spon-
sors was to strengthen the
hand of management. To do
this, they devised a clever law
which insidiously undermines
the strength of labor unions.
*
"The Taft-Hartley Law
hangs over the head of labor,
threatening to destroy the
gains of 15 years. There it will
hang until we are able to re-
place it with a law that is
fair to management and labor
alike.
"That is something we must
do-not only for the sake of
labor, but for the sake of the
whole country. I believe pro-
foundly that the Taft-Hartley
Law is a substantial Infringe-
ment on the basic freedom to
bargain collectively.
"I will not cease to fight for
its repeal."
â˜…
That is all. There is no sug-
gestion of specifications for a
law after the repeal of Taft-
Hartley and no suggestion that
a revived Wagner Act would
be improved to bring relief
from such strikes as the recent
railroad imbroglio. In the 1948
railroad strike, the President
was really angry. He seized
the railroads and secured an
injunction against two broth-
erhoods and another union.
This time, It was unneces-
sary to have a fact-finding
board of his own creation.
There had been plenty of fact
finding. Two Presidential fact-
finding boards-one in 1943
and another last year-had
found the basic union demand
without merit. This demand,
It should be noted, was for an
extra fireman on large Die-
sel engines-as clear a case of
featherbedding as could be im-
agined.
*
And so, while a great section
of the country suffered severe
inconvenience and millions in
economic loss, the President
had nothing to offer but a re-
turn to the good old days of
the Wagner Act. This must
have been cold comfort even
to the striking railroad men.
On the Pennsylvania alone,
85,000 men were losing $1,000,-
000 a day in wages.
