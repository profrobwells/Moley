NORMAN
THOMAS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Norman Thomas occupies an
unusual, perhaps unique, place
in American political life.
He has been the candidate
of the Socialist Party in six
Presidential elections. He has
also been a candidate for
other offices over a long period
of years.
In those many candidacies
he has been the refuge of thou-
sands who have tried to vote
without favoring either of the
major candidates. He has
been a haven for protest.
Those thousands never
really believed in the things
Norman Thomas was advocat-
ing. It is to be doubted
whether they really knew or
cared to know.
In fact, in one election for
the Mayoralty of New York
he was the darling of rather
high-toned and thoroughly
capitalistic people. The major
candidates that year—1929—
were Jimmy Walker and
Fiorello LaGuardia.
It is a favorite attitude of
the so-called intelligentsia and
a large part of Park Ave. in
New York to sniff at Tam-
many. Much of this is an
honest dislike of Tammany's
sins. But a substantial part
might be called a snobbish
disdain for some of the de-
classe elements that make up
Tammany's following.
Walker was unadulterated
Tammany. And hence these
people voted for Thomas who,
despite his somewhat pale
Marxism, has very respectable
attributes.
These people could not then
vote for LaGuardia for the
Little Flower was at that time
widely regarded as a some-
what rough fellow.
And so to vote for Thomas
became a badge not only of
independence, but of a certain
distinction.
But now, apparently, in his
ripe years Thomas really
wants to get something done
besides talk. His proposal to
his party was that it "function
loyally" with the CIO-PAC and
ADA and the AFL, Labor
League. In this way, he be-
lieves, the Socialists could do
a better job of "education."
A real reason, however,
must have been that Thomas
saw these groups running
away with all his stuff. Their
programs have become more
Socialistic than the Socialist
Party. No doubt Thomas
found in many debates with
New and Fair Dealers a most
uncomfortable agreement.
After all, when a confirmed
addict to protest finds a ma-
jority agreeing with him, he
has to make a difficult choice.
He must find a new point of
disagreement or sink beneath
the mass of the majority and
lose his claim to distinction.
Thomas chose the latter. His
party decided to go its lonely
way. Socialism without
Thomas will be strange. It
will be especially puzzling to
many kindly Americans who
believe that Thomas invented
Socialism.
