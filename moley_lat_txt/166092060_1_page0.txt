The dependence of the Truman
administration upon the
strange alliance of big city
machines, the political arms
of labor and the dubious political
underworld is well
shown in the current effort to
save Senate Majority Leader
Lucas in Illinois. A visit to
that State confirmed that hard
fact to this observer last week.
When Sen. Kefauver and his
aides moved into Illinois in
pursuance of their investigation
of organized crime, they
found plenty of material already
collected. For 35 years
the Chicago Crime Commission,
headed by public-spirited
businessmen, has gathered
evidence.
Nowhere in the United
States is there such an accumulation
of the annals of
crime. And what is most important,
these records clearly
show the interweaving of organized
crime with the lower
but enormously broad ranges
of organized politics.

The Chicago machine is always
ready to serve the Federal
machine. In May there
was organized a vast pageant
and convocation for Truman.
The almost ludicrous name
given to this affair was the
National Jefferson Jubilee.
On that occasion, a friendly
bite for the expenses, exacted
from Republican as well as
Democratic businessmen, was
helped by a ruling of the Federal
Income Tax Commissioner.
He held that contributions
for this outburst of profit and
patriotism would be constituted
allowable as ordinary
and necessary business deductions
under the Internal
Revenue Code.
The salvation of Sen. Lucas
is now essential to both the
machine and the Truman administration.
For Lucas is,
after all, one of the four major
administration leaders in Congress.
To have him repudiated
would cruelly injure the
Truman program. And to lose
Lucas as a Senator would
deny the machine a fine avenue
of Federal patronage.
Lucas needs help, because
his opponent, former Rep. Everett
Dirksen, is able, thoroughly
informed on national
issues, and an indefatigable
campaigner.

In the midst of all this, a
prominent figure on the Democratic
ticket, Dan Gilbert,
candidate for Sheriff, has become
the center of interest in
the campaign. He admits that
he has riches far beyond any
possible savings from his official
means of livelihood. And
no specific evidence has appeared
that shows a dishonest
source. But since the vicious
alliance between crime and
politics has flourished for
years, and since hundreds of
gang murders have remained
unsolved, Gilbert's quality as
a major law enforcement officer
is seriously questioned.
The entire press, including
the Democratic Sun-Times,
has denounced him.
But the machine must carry
him through and carry
Lucas, too. For the machine
must live, and the government
in Washington must
carry on the great welfare
crusade.
