Campaign Against Taft
Warns Public Servants
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The thought that lingers
with this observer after a sur-
vey of the Taft-CIO-AFL cam-
paign in Ohio concerns what
a Taft defeat would mean in
the public life of the nation.
Taft himself is not indis-
pensable. No one is indispens-
able.
But the means by which
such a defeat might be
achieved would be a blow to
the best instincts in every
public servant, notably in
every member of Congress.
And, on the other hand, it
would bring out the worst in
every member.
Notice would be served that
majorities do not prevail in
political life, but well-organ-
ized minorities. Further no-
tice would be served that it is
not sufficient to serve one's
constituents faithfully. For at
any moment, powerful aggres-
sion might rush over the bor-
der from faraway national
headquarters of various or-
ganizations and by sheer
power of personnel, ruthless
political machinery and mon-
ey destroy a man's status
with his neighbors.

Such an eventuality would
mean that a member's honest
conviction could not be
counted upon as a guide to
voting in Congress. For in a
campaign like this, a candi-
date cannot get a hearing for
his convictions. The blare of
new, synthetic campaign
methods and the blinding
storm of smear propaganda
deny the voice of reason a
fair hearing. The candidate
is thrown off guard and kept
busy answering reckless mis-
representations.
I want to make clear a very
important point about this
Ohio campaign. Neither Taft's
opponent nor the CIO-AFL
is debating the Taft-Hartley
Act, although their real pur-
pose is to destroy it. Only
Taft is discussing Taft-Hart-
ley. The Labor League rea-
lizes that a straight referen-
dum on the act would be dis-
astrous to them.
Instead, they are raking up
every possible bit of personal
vituperation and prejudice to
sway votes that have no inter-
est in Taft-Hartley.
Negroes are being stirred
by specious attacks on Taft's
record on FEPC and by new
promises of benefits to come.
Veterans are needled by
charges of Taft votes on some
very small items of legisla-
tion.
Catholics, Jews and other re-
ligious groups are subjected to
insidious appeals.
Internationalists are told to
vote anti-Taft and anti-isola-
tion-a snide word at best.
Finally, there is a heavy
strain of naked appeal to class
prejudice, based on Taft's
fairly fortunate economic and
social background.

In the light of that appeal,
let us consider what a Taft
defeat would say to a boy in
Ohio-or anywhere-who has
read the copy-book maxims
and who dreams of serving his
country in high office.
He would be told that in
this sort of politics his father
and grandfather, however dis-
tinguished, would be smeared
and dishonored.
That if he goes to college
and studies hard to get good
grades, he will be sneered at
because he was a studious
youth.
That if he had inherited
enough from his family to ven-
ture into politics, he would be
attacked as a child of special
privilege.
If he learned his facts and
used them in debate, he would
be ridiculed for having no
"political sex appeal." And if
he followed the advice of Lin-
coln and Emerson and dared
to be nonconformist, he would
be destroyed.
All these are issues in Ohio.
They are clubs used to beat
Taft. They are not sincerely
held objections, for they are
merely means to avoid the real
issues.
If Taft loses, what will all
this mean to intellectually
honest people in office and
idealistic young people who
want to go into public life?
