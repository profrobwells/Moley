LONDONâ€”As this election
campaign moves on at a more
rapid pace, Labor speakers are
giving less and less attention
to their promises to go further
with the nationalization of industries.
This may be a mere strategic
move and, in their minds, they
may still be intent upon Socialism
for Socialism's sake. But
their behavior clearly shows
that they think the British
people are less concerned with
Socialism as a theoretical objective
and are more concerned with
jobs, bread and places to live.
Consequently, the issue of
full employment is being
driven to the fore by Labor
with the proud boast that they
have achieved it and that, if the
Conservatives win, it will not
be maintained.
To an outside observer, the
Labor claim that the government
is responsible for Britain's full
employment is pretty
thin. It is about as valid as a
claim in the United States that
President Truman has made
60,000,000 jobs.
In the first place, the observer
is struck by the fact that
there is plenty of featherbedding
in employment. In many
instances, especially in service
lines, it is evident there are
more people who are theoretically
employed than is justified by the
services produced.
In restaurants and hotels, help
is falling all over itself. Things
are moving in building operations,
but with an excess of
workers and a deficiency in
speed. Despite Labor claims of
more abundant production,
there is still a deficiency in production
and a great lag in
efficiency.
As some observers here point
out, it would have required
remarkable incompetence to
have prevented full employment
over the last five years.
The widespread destruction
and the denials of war created
a tremendous deferred demand
for durable goods. In export
trades, inflation greatly stimulated
markets in other sterling
countries.
Labor speakers call attention
to unemployment in Germany.
To this Churchill replies that,
considering the great numbers
of refugees from the Soviet
zone, there is good reason for
this unemployment.
Confronted by the danger of
inflation in building materials
and food prices, the government
has deliberately decided
to restrict building and other
investment fields in order to
keep a small amount of goods
and food at lower prices.
This timidity is characteristic
of a group which has confidence
neither in private initiative
nor in the natural
economic laws of supply and
demand. In short, Labor seems
to have courage where caution
would be wiser and caution
where courage might be the
means of real, not fictitious,
prosperity.
