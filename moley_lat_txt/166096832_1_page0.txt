Point 4 Is Really Meant
to Be a Permanent ECA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The method of indirection
which characterizes the po-
litical mind is well illustrated
not only by President Tru-
man's strategy in holding up
his Fair Deal program for elec-
tion ammunition, but by the
real purposes of his famous
Point 4. Neither is what it
seems to he.

Now we are able to see some
new light on Point 4, proudly
proposed in the Truman in-
augural 15 months ago. No
real program was introduced
into last year's session of Con-
gress. Rather, this grandiose
generality provided busy work
for a great many bureaucrats
with time on their hands and
an itch to plan new spendings.
Dozens of government agen-
cies went to work, including
some 20 on Latin America
alone. The United Nations fell
to with zest.

As a result of these activi-
ties and of what has been de-
veloped in Congressional hear-
ings on the subject, it becomes
more than clear that Point 4
is to be an immensely en-
larged and permanent ECA. Of
course, it was made clear that
help for "underdeveloped
areas" was not to apply to
Marshall countries because
they are not "underdeveloped."
Also, it was made clear that
private, not public, capital is
to be used.

But a few considerations will
reveal how completely Point 4
will take over and include a
long-time Marshall Plan.

In the first place, it is recog-
nized and admitted by repre-
sentatives of the Truman ad-
ministration that private capi-
tal going to such countries
will have to be guaranteed by
the government. That means
that under such guarantees
private investors will make
loans that they would not
otherwise make. A good state-
ment of the limits of private
investment is that of Winthrop
Aldrich, chairman of the
Chase National Bank:
"The more closely a foreign
country reaches a parity
of risk with, say, the State of
Massachusetts, the more apt
American capital is to make
an investment in that coun-
try."

That is a correct measure of
what a bank should do because
it cannot play fast and loose
with the money entrusted to
it.

The American taxpayer
sooner or later must meet
most of the costs of Point 4.
Even though Marshall coun-
tries may not get direct help
under Point 4, it is neverthe-
less a means of helping them
beyond 1952 and indefinitely.
For it will help their colonies,
if they have any, and provide
markets for their products.
Whether we shall engage in
this vast undertaking is a sub-
ject for fair consideration. Per-
haps our destiny is to take
over the burden and perhaps
some of the rewards of older
empires, such as those of the
British, the Belgians, the
Dutch and the French.

But the program should be
undertaken with a clear con-
ception of what it means, and
of what our capacity will be to
sustain it. Most important, we
should know whether, if pri-
vate capital is to be used, even
with a guarantee, this admin-
istration will change the do-
mestic policies which now
make it almost impossible for
such capital to accumulate.
We cannot be capitalist abroad
