DILEMMA
FOR TAFT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

At last week's Governors'
conference at White Sulphur
Springs the attractive Ohio
Governor, Frank Lausche,
made a distinct impression.
This was signalized at the con
clusion of the meeting by his
election as next year's chair
man of the conference.
This was an implied tribute
by a group of politicians to
the fact that the best politics
may be an occasional repudia
tion of the stock routine of
party regularity. For Lausche
has always manifested utter
contempt for the machine
Democrats of his State. And
the voters have loved this in
dependence. In 1948 regular
Democrats in droves refrained
from voting for him. But larg
er droves of Lausche Republi
cans swept him into office.

It has been clear for a long
time that Gov. Lausche has a
great deal of admiration for
Sen. Taft. In the course of the
conference Lausche was asked
for a comment concerning his
choice for U.S. Senator be
tween Taft and his strange
opponent, Joseph T. Ferguson.
He said that his general pre
disposition was to vote for
Ferguson — a predisposition
which meant to vote generally
Democratic. But he added
these words every one of
which was carefully calculated:
"I will vote, when I deter
mine the issue, for the candl
date I believe will serve the
nation best. If I decide it's Joe
Ferguson, I shall vote for him.
If it's Taft, I'll vote for him.
"I will not allow my party
interest to overcome my in
terest in my country."

*

This has been variously in
terpreted. But a sound and
politically watertight meaning
is that Lausche was offering
something in the nature of a
challenge to Taft. In short, he
probably meant this:
If Taft believes in putting
the public interest before par
ty interest, he will vote for
Lausche, who has been an out
standing Governor. When he
so decides, Lausche will ignore
party interest and vote for
Taft.
This is about where matters
now stand.
There is no question about
Lausche's popularity among
the most substantial of Taft's
supporters. In my own con
tacts with Ohio businessmen
who are contributing to Taft's
campaign fund—which, by the
way, is not as large as has been
reported—it has become clear
that Lausche will get their
votes for Governor. Conserva
tive opinion in Ohio is for Taft
and Lausche.

Taft's decision will be hard
to make. Don Ebright, State
Treasurer and Republican
candidate for Governor, is a
fine kind of public official. He
came into prominence in the
days when John Bricker was
Governor. He has waited a
long time for his chance at
the Governorship.
Taft is, moreover, a party
man. He believes in regularity
as an asset of responsible gov
ernment. It would be hard for
him to reject a man like
Ebright and turn against his
party.
It will be interesting to note
the progress of this highly col
orful political courtship.
