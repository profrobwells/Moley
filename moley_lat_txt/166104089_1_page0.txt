Brannan's Silly Argument
Against Co-operative Taxes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Like many other good words
appropriated by Socialist-
minded politicians, "co-opera-
tive" covers a multitude of
sins.
Congress seems to have finally
killed the President's scheme
to bribe middle-income people
with what is called "co-opera-
tive" housing. This proposal
will serve to illustrate the
basic difference between a policy
in which government takes
measures to prevent any individual
or group from falling below a
minimum subsistence level and a
policy of government handouts to
all classes, irrespective of proven
means and need.
The latter is called by the
British Labor Party "fair
shares." It really means equal
shares. And it is Socialism, no
matter what fine verbal
plumage it may wear.
*
In this instance it was a
shrewdly calculated political
move to induce support for
the Fair Deal by offering housing
to what might be called
our "middle classes," on terms
that would not only have expanded
the bureaucracy and raised the
burden of government expense but
would have added new thousands
to those dependent on government
aid. The coalition in Congress saw
the nature and purpose of this
measure and killed it.
It will not be so easy to
penetrate the defenses of another
form of vested interest
which is hidden in the fine
word "co-operative." For many
big businesses in competition
with taxpaying private enterprises
enjoy immunity from
the obligation to support the
government from which they
receive unmeasured services
and benefits.

Secretary of Agriculture
Brannan, who is rapidly
achieving the distinction of being
the most Socialistic of all
important members of the Truman
family, presented on
March 3 a plea to the Ways
and Means Committee against
the taxation of co-operatives.
Congressman Noah Mason has
offered a powerful reply in a
letter to the Secretary.
After disposing of the Secretary's
argument that fair taxation
would destroy co-operatives,
the Congressman moved
to the very heart of the argument
for a fair measure of
taxation on operations that are
extraneous to the original purpose
of co-operatives.
Since Brannan claimed exemption
for farmers on the
ground that they have been
underpaid for their products
and have overpaid for supplies
or service, Mason cited
in reply the case of a Minnesota
co-op which made large
profits in such operations as
lending money, storing grain
and speculating in the commodity
markets. He also cited
the case of an Indiana co-op
which had an untaxed capital
gain of $1,000,000 from the sale
of a group of oil wells.
*
As is often the case in Secretary
Brannan's methods of
argument, he succeeded in this
case in contradicting himself.
On the one hand he declared
that taxing co-ops "would result
in only a little additional
revenue," and on the other that
taxation would destroy these
lusty children of privilege.
This suggests the Secretary's
claim that on one hand his
farm plan would not cost more
than present farm supports
and that on the other his proposed
subsidies would bring
new prosperity to the farmer
and lower the cost of living to
the consumer.
Brannan cannot have it both
ways, and neither can the
co-ops.
