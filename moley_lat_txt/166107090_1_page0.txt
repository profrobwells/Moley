Jessup Case Moral: Don't Be
a Sponsor Unless You Know
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The attitude of a fair-minded
American toward the whirling
dervish methods of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy must be that of re-
gret and disapproval. The Sen-
ator is pointing to a very real
condition, but his wholesale
and unsubstantiated charges
are dangerous and unfair.
In the case of his charges
against Ambassador-at-Large
Philip C. Jessup this is es-
pecially true. For many years
I was a fellow professor in
the same department with
Jessup, and it is obvious to
me that any charge of im-
proper Soviet sympathy is pre-
posterous. It is unfortunate
that Jessup felt compelled to
go into his history at such
length before the Senate com-
mittee, but his statement may
help to clear the record.
His public record has been
the story of an earnest and
thoroughly trained internation-
al lawyer and diplomat.
In his statement, a point is
raised which deserves a great
deal of consideration by all
Americans of influence and
note who are constantly so-
licited to sponsor this or that
seemingly good cause. Sen.
McCarthy asserted that Jessup
had "sponsored" the American-
Russian Institute. Jessup's an-
swer is that he did not spon-
sor the institute but that he
lent his name as a sponsor for
a dinner given by the insti-
tute in 1946. The dinner was
held for the purpose of paying
a tribute to Franklin D. Roose-
velt which was accepted by
his family.
It seems that a number of
left-wing people were on the
same list—people who would
certainly give a pinkish tone
to the affair. But Jessup prop-
erly points out that a lot of
other names appeared which
would certainly lend eminent
respectability to the list.
The mechanics of getting
names for a letterhead or a
dinner menu or what not pre-
clude a person's knowing who
his associates will be. He can
know the people invited as
sponsors when he is solicited,
but he cannot know who will
accept. And in such efforts the
solicitor always sweetens the
list with a lot of distinguished
names whose owners will prob-
ably not accept. They are put
down as bait for others. And
so the sponsor really sub-
scribes to a blind chance, and
since he takes this chance, it
is his own fault if he finds him-
self in bad company.
A great many editors and
other professional people have
a sound rule—to sponsor
nothing. They forego the
pleasure of seeing their names
in print because they want to
keep their independence. Pro-
fessors and public officials
might well follow this exam-
ple.
Good people should jealously
guard their good names.
Don't sponsor anything unless
you know all about it.
