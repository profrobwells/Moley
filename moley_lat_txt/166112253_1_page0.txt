U.S. CAN
TAKE ALL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At the recent Governors'
conference at White Sulphur
Springs, Gov. Allen Shivers of
Texas sharply reminded his
fellow State executives that
under the Supreme Court de-
cision in the Texas marginal
sea case, no natural resources
of any State can be safe from
Federal expropriation.
His claim is correct, and un-
less Congress acts we may
find in the next emergency the
Federal power asserting own-
ership of minerals and other
resources far from the inter-
national boundaries and far
from the sea.
Aside from the general
claims of California and Loui-
siana in other cases of this sort,
Texas had a right that seemed
to go to the very pledged word
of the nation. For when the
Republic of Texas was an-
nexed it had expressly assert-
ed its ownership of the miner-
als under its coastal waters. In
the joint resolution admitting
Texas, this property was not
included among the various
military and defense proper-
ties given to the Federal gov-
ernment.

In his opinion, Justice Doug-
las supported the general
claim of the United States to
the property on two grounds.
First, he asserted that, since
Texas became a member of the
United States on an "equal
footing" with other States, it
lost any claims that the other
States did not have.
Second, Douglas admitted
that, since Texas was a sover-
eign State before annexation,
it not only had sovereignty
over but ownership of the land
under the marginal sea. Then,
he said, when it surrendered
its sovereignty to the United
States it surrendered owner-
ship as well. The words of the
decisions are these:
"We hold that as an incident
of that sovereignty any claim
that Texas may have to the
marginal sea was relinquished
to the United States."
★
In answer to that, Justice
Frankfurter said:
"The court now decides that
when Texas entered the Union
she lost what she had and the
United States acquired it. How
that shift came to pass remains
for me a puzzle."
The court makes no attempt
to show why the oil under the
water is more important for
defense than oil in Oklahoma.
What it does is to insert craft-
ily the idea that, since the
sovereign power of the United
States over the marginal sea
is a matter established in in-
ternational law, the right of
sovereignty and the right of
ownership, or in legal terms,
imperium and dominium, are
merged:
"Property rights must then
be so subordinated to political
rights as in substance to co-
alesce and unite in the nation-
al sovereign."
★
What is really happening is
a subtle process of using na-
tional defense necessities and
national sovereignty as a
means of establishing Federal
property rights over all State
resources.
The issue now goes to Con-
gress, which fortunately is still
elected in States possessing
such resources. It is neither
appointed by the President nor
is it subordinate to the Su-
preme Court. The distinction
between sovereignty and own-
ership should be fully estab-
lished in law, despite what will
certainly be vigorous opposi-
tion by the President.
