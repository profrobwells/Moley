BUT WHOSE
RIGHTS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a previous column, some
of Mrs. Roosevelt's efforts as
chairman of the Human
Rights Commission of the
United Nations were viewed
in their more amusing as-
pects.
There is, however, a more
serious side to this attempt
by zealous but purblind
people to create and codify
the rights of all men in all
nations in a standardized pattern. Sooner or later, these
efforts by sentimental Americans, vested with official
color by Presidential appointment, will come home to
roost.
At that point, the Senate
of the United States will be
compelled either to amend
and qualify its acceptance of
a generalized treaty, or accept, willy-nilly, a hodge-
podge of kindly aspirations
set down to legalize almost
anything that any reformer
may desire.
If, in line with constitutional principles, common
sense and sound public policy, the Senate should reject
or radically modify a so-
called covenant of human
rights, our sincerity will be
at a discount all over the
world.

For our enemies, notably
the Communist nations, will
say that we either do not
know the meaning of liberty,
or that we have welshed on
our undertaking, or that we
are the most colossal phonies
in history. For Mrs. Roosevelt
is clothed with some official
status. She represents the
United States on this commission. Her words carry
great weight abroad, because
she is the widow of a man
whom many distant peoples
regard as the inventor of
human rights.
A careful examination of
the different versions of the
proposed covenant—which,
in my dictionary, means a
solemn agreement, and which
if it is ever finished is to be
a paraphrase of the all-things-
to-all-men declaration of human rights adopted by the
U.N. Assembly in 1948—re-
veals that the covenant will
be stretched to be accepted
by all sorts of nations. It will
mean everything and nothing
in all nations—Socialist, Communist, absolutistarian and republican.
It is certain, unless our
statesmen lose their minds,
that such a covenant will be
thrown out or drastically
hedged by reservations in the
Senate. Then we will have another generation of hullabaloo over here about the terrible isolationists who killed
the hope of the world. And
great national elections will
hinge on an issue wholly irrelevant to the needs and
problems of the nation.

For in a world of sovereign
nations there will always be
differences in forms of government. Forms of government
rise from social conditions and customs. And an
essential characteristic of a
nation’s form of government
is the relation of the individual to the government.
In some nations, the individual accepts the denial of
his liberty by government
in exchange for what he considers to be a fair return from
the government. In some,
the principle of State collectivism is present.
In others, the individual
is king and the government
is his subject.
Uniformity of relations between government and the
individual can never be
achieved in reality. The very
essence of sovereignty is the
right of a nation to decide
its form of government,
which means its own conception of the rights of citizens.
