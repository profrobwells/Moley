How the Democrats Contrive
to Get the Farm Vote Again
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since it is clear that the
election of 1948 was decided by
the farm vote, candidates ev-
erywhere are scanning the ag-
ricultural situation. They are
finding marked differences
from the conditions two years
ago. And those differences do
not favor Democratic candi-
dates who have followed the
Truman-Brannan line.
In President Truman's ag-
gressive campaign in 1948, he
used, with a great deal of suc-
cess, the argument that the
Republican 80th Congress had
imposed upon the farmer flex-
ible supports which might de-
stroy his time-honored depend-
ence upon 90% of parity. The
specter of 60% of parity was
raised.
*
Of course, this was a spe-
cious argument. The flexible
plan was a bipartisan agree-
ment. This has been asserted
over and over since then by
former Secretary of Agricul-
ture, and now Sen. Anderson.
But in 1948 the Truman argu-
ment worked.
It worked so well that Tru-
man and Secretary Brannan
decided that the farm vote
could be held and increased by
new and more ample prom-
ises. But such promises to the
farmers must not be offensive
to city workers, who eat the
products of the farm. Hence,
a miracle or, rather, the prom-
ise of a miracle was required.
And so the Brannan plan was
produced and vigorously pro-
moted.
That plan promised not
merely 90% parity but 100%.
A careful analysis revealed
that it was still a promise of
90% on the former basis of
calculations.
Since the Department of Ag-
riculture feared that this high
range of prices when guaran-
teed for perishables would
bring about huge surpluses,
there was added that special
Brannan refinement, subsidies
for every grocery basket. Thus
it was hoped that both farmer
and consumer would be happy.
But the two big farm organ-
izations saw the frightening
danger of this proposal to put
the farmer on an excessive
and permanent dole. They
fought the plan. And mem-
bers of Congress of both par-
ties refused to agree to it.
Meanwhile, Secretary Bran-
nan proceeded to impose re-
strictions on corn and cotton
under existing law a law to
which Brannan himself had
contributed before he ascend-
ed to the Cabinet.
â˜…
As far as corn was con-
cerned, most farmers declined
to follow the restrictions. This
is fortunate, because if they
had followed them, we should
now have very considerably
less corn than we had a year
ago. In the face of a big war
mobilization that would have
been very bad indeed.
Farmers who complied with
Brannan's restrictive propos-
als are now out the money
they might have made from
the corn they failed to plant.
The Farm Bureau Federa-
tion has made this loss to the
farmers clear in a recent state-
ment. It exposed the essen-
tially fraudulent nature of the
whole Brannan plan. And this
year in Congress that plan lost
most of its support.
The reaction of the admin-
istration has been to wage a
fierce political war upon Al-
lan Kline, head of the Farm
Bureau Federation. It is try-
ing, not very effectively, to
organize an opposition within
Kline's organization. And in
the appointments of farm rep-
resentatives to the Symington
advisory board, Kline was de-
liberately by-passed.
This is the situation faced
by administration candidates
as they approach next month's
election. It has little similarity
to that of 1948. It is not likely
to hold the Republican farm
vote that switched in 1948.
