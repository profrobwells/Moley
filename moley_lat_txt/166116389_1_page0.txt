American
Money in
Germany
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Within five years after the
Dawes Plan of 1924, Americans
invested more than $5,000,000,-
000 in Germany. Most of that
money was lost.
There are, however, recover-
able claims for at least $80,000,-
000 to $100,000,000 still out-
standing in Germany. But
these funds are frozen in
blocked accounts. There is also
a great deal of capital there
which is owned by people in
America who were driven from
Germany by the Nazis.
*
Hitler, of course, confiscated
the property of hundreds of
thousands of German Demo-
crats, gentiles and Jews, many
of whom found refuge here.
The Hitler confiscation has
been invalidated through the
wiping out of Nazi laws. Real
estate and shares of stock are
being returned to owners in
the American and French
zones, with some indemnities
added to make up for unrecov-
erable losses.
Many of the owners who are
now in the United States are
now advanced in years and are
living directly or indirectly on
charity or on public funds, be-
cause their German holdings
are frozen.
The freezing of these large
properties makes the need of
new capital in Germany for
re-
viving industry, notably for
the Schuman plan, even more
acute. Hence, the high com-
missioners have taken the ini-
tial step toward "unfreezing"
this property.
*
They are still unwilling, how-
ever, to permit any of these
funds to be taken out of Ger-
many, although they do per-
mit them to be invested in Ger-
man industry.
The suggestion has been
made that former Germans in
America and other non-Soviet
countries be permitted to sell
their blocked accounts to other
"nonresidents" of Germany,
say to Swiss bankers. This pur-
chasing of blocked accounts is
now being done illegally, main-
ly by German industrialists
who still have salted away very
considerable sums in some neu-
tral countries. They need this
capital now for rebuilding
their industries.
Under the present regula-
tions their dollars abroad can
only be sold officially at a rate
of 4½ marks per dollar. If it
were to be made legal for them
to buy the blocked accounts
they would receive 8½ marks
for a dollar, which until now
has been the black market rate,
*
There would be great advan-
tages in making this procedure
legal. These industrialists
would then be more willing
and able to contribute toward
the financing of the reconstruc-
tion of Germany.
This would not cost anything
to the United States, but it
would definitely contribute to
the recovery of Germany and
thus ultimately relieve us of a
large part of the annual bur-
den that we now sustain for
official help and relief.
