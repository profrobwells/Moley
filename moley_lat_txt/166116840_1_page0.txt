OF HUMAN
RIGHTS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
High honors in the long roll
of historic futilities will go to
the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights,
Mrs. Roosevelt, chairman of
that group, may be the very
embodiment of good intentions,
but her great limitations in
knowledge of law, systematic
political philosophy and political
history make for deeper
and deeper plunges into confusion.
After eternal discussion
there appeared a strange document
called "Universal Declaration
of Human Rights" which
was "adopted and proclaimed"
by the U.N. General Assembly
in December, 1948.
In the jargon of the United
Nations it was said that this
declaration was "accepted" by
the United States and a long
string of member nations.
This, of course, did not mean
that the United States officially
accepted it, for that would
require adoption by constitutional
amendment.
★
All the declaration really
means is that a group of well-
meaning people selected by
some authority in many nations
put together some words
and got a vote in the General
Assembly. It is a set of pious
ideas couched in vague language
by a group of zealous
reformers.
The document itself deserves
close scrutiny by Americans
who are anxious about protecting
their own form of government.
A cautious and intelligent
statesman, Walter
George, recently said in the
Senate that, once this declaration
was ratified, we should
have "changed the character
of the government of the
United States."
At the very beginning of
the document, the essential
constitutional rights of Americans—
to life, liberty and property—
are amended to read,
"life, liberty and security of
person." Far down among
the multitudinous "rights" are
some words relating to property:
"Everyone has the right
to own property alone as well
as in association with others."
And "no one shall arbitrarily
be deprived of his property."
★
What kind of property is
thus guaranteed is not clear.
And it is equally unclear what
"arbitrarily" shall be construed
to mean. The word "arbitrary"
is a literary and moralistic
characterization. It
means that some act that one
does not like one calls "arbitrary."
It has no usefulness
in jurisprudence.
The cream of the jest, however,
is in another article in
which the whole Socialistic
package is inserted: "Everyone
has the right to a standard
of living adequate for the
health and well-being of himself
and of his family, including
food, clothing, housing and
medical care and necessary social
services, and the right to
security in the event of unemployment,
sickness, disability,
widowhood, old age or other
lack of livelihood in circumstances
beyond his control."
(Apparently, being a
widow is beyond his control.)
★
Motherhood and childhood
are entitled to special care and
assistance. All children,
whether born in or out of
wedlock, "shall enjoy the same
social protection."
Perhaps in a later version,
for these "rights" are now being
put into the form of a
"covenant," new rights will be
included. Perhaps there will
be a "right" for everyone to
have a television set, a deep
freeze and a copy of "This I
Remember."
