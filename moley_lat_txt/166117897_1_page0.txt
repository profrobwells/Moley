SOCIALISTS
ONLY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The British Labor Party, in
rejecting economic co-opera-
tion with Euroepan govern-
ments because they are not
sufficiently Socialist, makes a
remarkable statement about
the United States.
It seems that the British So-
cialists still believe it is all
right to work with us. Of
course, this is because their
co-operation, consists of accept-
ing our help. But in assign-
ing a reason, the Labor Party
statement makes the point that
"outside Britain, and Scandi-
navia there is no government
with a more progressive do-
mestic or foreign program
than the present United States
administration."
★
Thus, the Labor government
says in effect, "We cannot plan
with France and the other
countries of Western Europe,
because those countries are
still capitalistic. Nothing but
public ownership in each coun-
try makes possible joint co-
operation. But Scandinavia, in
which Socialism is well estab-
lished, fits our pattern. And
the present Truman adminis-
tration—not the nation, it is
important to note—has a suf-
ficiently Socialistic program to
satisfy our requirements."
It would be interesting to
have some alert Washington
correspondent ask the Presi-
dent what he has to say about
this. If he repeats what he has
been saying about Socialism as
a "scare word," he is denying
the right of real Socialist ex-
perts in Britain to define So-
cialism. If he accepts this com-
pliment, we must conclude
that he is in fact making us
over to fit the Socialist pattern.

The British statement also
reveals the mockery of tradi-
tional Socialist doctrine, which
held that the only road to
peace is Socialism, and that So-
cialism is really international-
ism. That claim, of course, was
badly damaged in World War
I when at the roll of the first
drum German and French So-
cialists rushed to the defense
of their own countries.
Socialism, says the Labor
Party, is nationalistic. Each
country must nationalize its
property first and then join in
a co-operative workers' world.
This is isolationism with a
vengeance. It denies the whole
principle of the United Nations
—that nations may co-operate,
regardless of differences in
forms of government.
It also raises an interesting
question of sincerity. The Brit-
ish Labor Party and its friends
in the United States have bit-
terly resented the suggestion
that we should extend Mar-
shall aid only on the condition
that Britain halt Socialism.
That, they claimed, would be
outside dictation of domestic
policy.

But in this case, they say to
France and other European
countries: "Only if you nation-
alize your industries and abol-
ish private profit will we work
with you."
Politically, this means the
first step toward a new Brit-
ish crisis. The statement rep-
resents the views of Dalton,
Shinwell and Aneurin Bevan,
the left wing of the Labor Par-
ty. It reveals the irreconcil-
able conflict within the party.
Probably the Conservatives
will now move toward the kill.
Despite the fact that even the
Conservatives if they had been
in power might have rejected
the Schuman plan, they can at-
tack the Labor Party's social-
istic reasons. With a division
in the Labor Party, it should
be easier now to upset the gov-
ernment and bring about an-
other election. In that elec-
tion, the Conservative pros-
pects should be much better
than they were in February.
