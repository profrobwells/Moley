Congress Gain
for GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The writer of this column
has never conceived it to be
his duty to don the robes of
a prophet. That is partly he-
cause such a robe often proves
to be the motley of a clown.
Four years ago, however, he
came within two House seats
and one Senate seat of the
correct result. That was due
to an incredible amount of
traveling, consultation with
local reporters, and a close
study of an unmistakable
trend.
This year the traveling has
been done and the consulta-
tion has been had.
There are two currents of
influence this year, either of
which would normally deter-
mine an election. But these
two currents run in opposite
directions and to a degree
must neutralize each other.
One is a very high level of
prosperity, which should help
Democrats. The other is a
sharp sense that the Truman
administration is incompetent.
The prevalence of the latter
over the former depends upon
its depth and strength. There
is no way to measure that.

However, from reports gath-
ered from various States a few
tentative conclusions are pos-
sible. The best of these reports
comes from Indiana, which
has in the past been a sort of
weather vane for the winds of
politics. Indiana has 11 seats
in the House. In the 80th Con-
gress nine of these were held
by Republicans; two by Dem-
ocrats, In the 81st Congress;
four are held by Republicans;
seven by Democrats.
This is, of course, an ab-
normal situation. Good ob-
servers say that at least three
Democratic seats will swing
back. One is certain to do so.
This evidence, matched by
other reports from other
Northern States, would give
good reason to estimate that
there may well be a swing of
10 to 15% from one side to the
other, which would mean a
change of about 30 or more
seats.
Thus, it is reasonable to ex-
pect that the next House will
be somewhere near a division
of 225 Democrats and 210 Re-
publicans. Marcantonio will
probably be wiped out.
â˜…
On the Senate side, there is,
according to present reports,
an almost certain chance to re-
place a Democrat with a Re-
publican in Pennsylvania and
Idaho. There are excellent
prospects for such a change in
California. There is a fair to
good prospect in Illinois, Okla-
homa, Utah, Maryland, New
York and Connecticut.
There is a probability that
the Republicans will lose one
in Colorado. At the moment,
all other Republican seats
seem to be safe, and that in-
cludes Ohio, Missouri and In-
diana. Therefore, if we can
guess that Republicans will
win in Pennsylvania, Idaho
and California and lose Colo-
rado, that means a net of two.
Then it seems fair to give
them two of the six where the
result is very doubtful. Hence,
a gain of four for the Repub-
licans, which means a Senate
balance of 50-46.
This is not my prediction.
It is the consensus of the best
opinions I have been able to
get.
