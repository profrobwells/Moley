Strachey Puts a Spoke
in Mr. Attlee's Wheel
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Prime Minister Attlee is
either an incredibly poor party
leader or he is a teller of tall
tales. John Strachey, the La-
bor government's Secretary of
State for War, has again raised
the issue of the Socialist atti-
tude toward the Schuman plan.
After a committee of the La-
bor Party issued a report de-
claring that the Socialist gov-
ernment could not have eco-
nomic co-operation with capi-
talist nations of the Continent,
Attlee disowned the sugges-
tion. He and other members of
his government declared in
Parliament that they not only
had no part in the declaration
but did not object to the Schu-
man plan on any such ground.
In other words, he told France
and Western Germany that
they could co-operate with Att-
lee's government, but not with
Attlee's party.
This was curious reasoning,
and in the House of Commons
the Conservative opposition
made a great deal of it. How-
ever, since the Conservatives
themselves are not favorable
to the plan, for quite different
reasons, they could hardly
force the issue to the point of
upsetting the government. The
Conservatives' real reason for
coldness to the plan is their
fear of a revived German steel
industry as a competitor of
Britain's.

And now comes John
Strachey with a blast which
follows the exact line of the
earlier party report—which,
incidentally, was the work of
Hugh Dalton.
Strachey, in terms that have
a faint suggestion of the out-
bursts of our own Henry Wal-
lace, denounces "the great
capitalistic interests of Eu-
rope." He says that those evil
capitalists are afraid that the
"people" may get control of
economic power.
Once more, as in the Dalton
report, the U.S. "government"—
not the United States, it
should be noted—is absolved
of the taint of capitalism. The
people in our government who
have been attacking our own
steel industry will enjoy
Strachey's tribute.
He says: "The U.S. govern-
ment is in many ways more
progressive than many of the
governments of Western Eu-
rope." The word "progressive"
is used to describe people who
would regiment or take over
the steel industry. Apparently
the industry itself, which in
private hands has created the
sinews of a new civilization,
is not itself "progressive."

This is the same Strachey
who used to write large tomes
about the death of capitalism
—works which, incidentally,
were eagerly read and re-
viewed in our own radical cir-
cles. He is the same person
who, as Minister of Food, was
responsible for the ridiculous
groundnuts scheme in East
Africa. He wasted tens of mil-
lions of precious government
dollars on growing peanuts,
which turned out to be the
most expensive peanuts in all
history.
Then, because as Minister of
Food he was a political liabili-
ty, Attlee made him Minister
of War. When the Beaver-
brook press attacked the plac-
ing of a person of his antece-
dents in charge of a British
military establishment, Attlee
defended Strachey, saying that
he had cast off his Commun-
ism. It will be interesting to
see what reasons Attlee will
find to defend him now.
