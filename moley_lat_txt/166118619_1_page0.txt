It would be exceedingly
helpful in developing better
foreign policy if we could' get
rid of the term isolationist.
It is used in a contemptuous
sense by the President and
others to castigate practically
everybody who disagrees with
what has been going on for
several years. It was used
before the recent world war
to describe everybody who
disagreed with the Roosevelt
policy of intervention in Europe.
It is commonly used by some
eastern and Washington columnists to belittle practically
everybody who lives west of
the Appalachians.
Thus, Taft, Wherry, Millikin
and Dirksen—especially Dirksen—are called isolationists.
The term is applied even to
such informed and indefatigable critics of the administration’s Asiatic policy as Knowland and Judd.
The chief reason why the
term is unfair is that it is used
to describe people who merely
shift the emphasis in foreign
relations from east to west. It
is used to describe people who
have some doubts about all-out
aid to Europe, but who favor a
very daring policy of intervention in the Far East.
The term might, with equal
force, be applied to Secretaries
Acheson and Marshall and to
the President himself, because
they pursued a policy of abandoning Asia to Communism
while they labored to provide
more aid to Europe.
Even the late Sen. Hiram
Johnson, who was called the
arch-isolationist of all time,
was deeply concerned in our
stake in the Pacific. He was
afraid of entanglements with
Europe because he saw there
no end to the hatreds and suicidal tendencies of the peoples
of that continent. Much the
same opinion was held by the
late Sen. Borah and other opponents of our support of the
League of Nations.
The absurdity of attempts to
apply the term isolation to the
traditional policies of the Republican Party appears in any
survey of the past century.
It was Secretary Seward
who moved boldly into the
Pacific, purchased Alaska and
marked out our sphere of interest as far as the islands of
the mid-Pacific.
Blaine, another great Secretary of State, initiated a
Pan-American policy and also
looked to our Pacific concerns.
Under his administration of
the State Department under
President Harrison, preparations were made for the annexation of Hawaii.
After Blaine’s death, his
successor, John W. Foster—incidentally the grandfather
of John Foster Dulles—presented a plan for annexing
Hawaii to the Senate and it
would have been passed, except for the victory of the
Democrats in 1892.
When the Republicans returned to power in 1897, annexation was taken up and in
the next year was an accomplished fact.
The war with Spain and its
aftermath really established
us as a world power and that
question was resolved when
Bryan made an unsuccessful
attempt to win on the issue of
imperialism.
With the Philippines as our
western outpost, John Hay
moved into China with his
open-door policy. Certainly no
one would call Theodore
Roosevelt, William H. Taft or
Charles E. Hughes isolationist. Nor Herbert Hoover when
Japan invaded Manchuria.
In the election just held,
there were many indications
that the voters were prepared
to defend our Far Eastern line
of interest and defense. The
success of Nixon, Dirksen and
Taft proved that. And the defeat of Tydings and Lucas
proved that voters were not
happy with the administration’s neglect of China.
What is needed now is an
end to the abuse of the word
isolationist and a reasonable
attitude toward both Europe
and Asia. If Europe will help
itself we have an obligation to
continue aid over there. But
room must be found for a
more coherent policy in the
Pacific because a Communist
Asia would be as great a threat
as a Communist Europe.
