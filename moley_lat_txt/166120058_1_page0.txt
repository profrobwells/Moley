Foreign Policy Without
Considering the Election
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If ever there was a moment
in our history when party
lines should be ignored in cre-
ating foreign policy it is now.
But the Truman administra-
tion seems to be in the process
of making grave decisions, in-
volving the peace of the entire
world, with no consideration at
all of the fact that the voters
have expressed a preference
for the opposition party.
According to Gen. Bradley,
practically the entire present
fighting potential of the American
Army is in Korea. We,
with our allies, for whom we
are measurably responsible,
are in actual contact with the
Red army of China. If our con-
tact with that army moves into
another stage we shall be far
beyond the preliminaries of a
third world war, we shall ac-
tually be in that war.
The representatives of Red
China are to begin the pres-
entation of their case at Lake
Success. Upon the outcome of
those discussions may rest the
future of the present war, per-
haps the future of all civiliza-
tion.

Our allies in the United Na-
tions are tremendously
alarmed at the possible course
of events once the border of
Manchuria is reached and are
ready to claim that their re-
sponsibility ends at that point.
They want to reach a settle-
ment of some kind and if such
a settlement is not reached
they may well leave us to fight
the new war alone.
We have already lost heavily
in this war, a fact which has
borne down bitterly upon
thousands of families over the
nation. Where do we go from
here? And who is to participate
in that frightening decision?
Apparently President Tru-
man and Secretary Acheson,
with their assorted subordi-
nates, are going to answer
those questions alone, despite
the glaringly apparent fact
that their judgment of the tem-
per of the people before the
recent election was wrong and
that they are still unwilling to
take a clear look at the elec-
tion returns.
Their supporting majority in
the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee of the Senate has been shot
to pieces. Of the eight Dem-
ocratic members of that com-
mittee, two, George and Ful-
bright, have received a vote of
approval at this election and
they enjoyed an assured elec-
tion. McMahon of Connecticut
has been returned. Two, Con-
nally and Green, are hold-
overs.
Three, Pepper, Tydings and
Thomas, have been soundly
trounced in campaigns in
which foreign policy, especial-
ly the matter of a proper atti-
tude toward Communism, has
been decisive.

What kind of mandate is
this for the President and his
Secretary of State to proceed
with grave decisions involving
the future of their country?
They might answer to this
that they have some Republi-
cans in and around Lake Suc-
cess. But these are not the au-
thentic spokesmen for the Re-
publican Party. There is War-
ren Austin, who is officially the
spokesman for the administra-
tion, not for the party to which
he belongs. There is John Fos-
ter Dulles, who has no Repub-
lican mandate at all.
And there is Sen. Henry
Cabot Lodge, who represents
only the eastern or northeast-
ern wing of the party whose
expressed views do not repre-
sent at all the attitude of the
Republican Senators and Sen-
ators-elect who won in this
election. Toward Taft, who is
foremost among the latter
group, there is only contemp-
tuous name calling.
There should be no feuding
while the foundations of world
peace and national security are
crumbling.
