SPENDING
SPREE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If a man were to draw all
his savings from the bank,
borrow on his insurance, cash
his bonds and engage in a
spending spree, he could, for
the moment, appear to be a
rich man.
It is hardly fair to press the
resemblance between this man
and our nation but there are
similarities between his situ-
ation and that of our country
that merit serious attention.
President Truman proudly
announced, just before the
vote curtain fell three weeks
ago, a national state of un-
paralleled prosperity. In Jan-
uary he heralded this intoxi-
cating business by predicting
that in five years our gross na-
tional product would be $300,-
000,000,000.
Now his economic helpers
are announcing that only 10
months later our gross nation-
al product had come within
$16,000,000,000 of the five-year
goal. They point out, however,
that this figure of $284,000,000,-
000 will be surpassed next
year.
It will, of course, be sur-
passed because, if we intro-
duce into our present economy
another $20,000,000,000 in ex-
penditures, we shall have an
increase in the national in-
come of $40,000,000,000. For
every dollar given to one re-
cipient becomes income for
two.
Not satisfied with this, the
Truman administration is pre-
paring another shot in the
arm in the form of a 1951
$1,000,000,000 distribution of
veterans' life insurance bon-
uses. This is an atmosphere al-
ready reeking with inflation-
ary infection.
What is behind this unprece-
dented boom? Several items
for which the administration
is directly responsible, others
for which it will take credit
until the unhealthy character
of the matter becomes appar-
ent.
As a direct cause the Ko-
rean war is relatively unim-
portant. Rather it is the war
scare that is important. For
booms are composed of psy-
chological elements as well as
of financial forces. The war
scare has pushed prices up by
scare buying directly stimulat-
ed by outcries from adminis-
tration sources about scarci-
ties to come, long in advance
of any possible materializa-
tion. As a result we are in the
most extreme price inflation
in our history.
In judging this price infla-
tion we should bear in mind
that the various indexes from
official sources lag behind the
facts. This is true of the cost-
of-living index. Wholesale
prices have risen 12% in a
year, which in itself explains
more than half of the increase
in the gross national product.
There has also been a tre-
mendous increase in spending
from past savings. In the past
seven months the government
has had to buy back more E
Bonds than it sold, something
that has not happened in 10
years. There has also been an
increase in debt, especially in
the lower income groups. This
Is a charge against future sav-
ings.
The administration has stim-
ulated the boom by artificial-
ly boosting food prices. The
high price of corn was men-
tioned no less than three
times in Truman's pre-election
broadcast.
There was a lot of talk in
the recent campaign of the Re-
publican "boom or bust" in
the 20s. Well, we now have the
boom and it is Democratic
this time. May Providence
save us from the bust. As
things look, we can expect
small protection from the gov-
ernment.
