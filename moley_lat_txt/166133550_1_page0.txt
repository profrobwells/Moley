Mission From Moscow
Indicates Hungary Ails
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Prof. Eugene Varga, leading
Soviet economist and close per-
sonal adviser of Stalin, has
been sent to Hungary, appar-
ently for the purpose of
streamlining and making ad-
aptations in the economic af-
fairs of that country. His mis-
sion has special significance.
In the course of some years
I have from time to time noted
the activities of Varga. During
the war Varga wrote an article
which was almost unnoticed
in dispatches from Europe.
But the contents of his article
almost exactly foretold the
subsequent Russian claims—
notably for reparations in ma-
chinery and man power. Just
after the war Varga warned
Russia that the United States
was not headed for a depres-
sion—an event devoutly an-
ticipated by the Communists.
The rabid element in the Po-
litburo made a great outcry
against Varga, and a ridicu-
lous economic state trial was
held. Varga was accused of
putting modern and current
economic facts—which he
knew thoroughly—against the
century-old predictions of
Marx. He did a bit of vague
recanting with tongue in cheek
and his punishment was lim-
ited to his removal from the
chairmanship of the Institute
of World Economics.

Apparently Stalin took a
more realistic view of the val-
ue of Varga, for he kept him
around and later his honors
were restored. Certainly Var-
ga’s prophecy was vindicated
by the course of economical af-
fairs in America.
Varga, who is now 71, is well
equipped for his Hungarian
mission. He is a native of that
country and was a professor
there until some time during
World War I. When Lenin and
Trotsky were sent to Russia
by the Germans to foster the
revolution Varga went along.
He has been a power in the
Soviet ever since.

It has been apparent for
some time that things are not
working well for the Soviets
among the Hungarians. Among
all the satellites, they have
the least kinship with the Rus-
sians. The Magyars are, of
course, non-Slavic. Their close
ties have been with Austria
and Germany. Their trade with
Italy in years past was a ma-
jor factor in their economic
life. They are not favorable
soil for the seeds of Commu-
nism.
No reliable figures on Hun-
gary’s economy are available
since 1947, but in that year
things looked bad. Their corn,
dairy products and other agri-
cultural production were great-
ly below prewar levels. The
Sovietization of the farms had
not gone well.
The farmers had been happy
to break up the large estates
of the Esterhazys and Karol-
yis. But the Magyars clung
to their individualistic habits
and resented agricultural Com-
munism. Their vineyards, de-
veloped over the generations,
were not suited to collectivist
patterns that were developed
for Russian peasants.

Perhaps the mission of Var-
ga is to explain these differ-
ences to Russian “organizers”
on the ground.
Since Stalin’s Russia has no
common frontier with Tito’s
Yugoslavia, a push against
that country would have to be
accomplished by satellites. But
while docile but incompetent
Bulgaria could be counted up-
on, the active collaboration of
Hungary would be essential.
Weakness, indifference or re-
bellion by Hungary would be
fatal.
It may also be that Tito has
been contributing to the Hun-
garian unrest. In any event,
Hungary is a weak spot in the
Communist front. Varga will
have no easy task.
