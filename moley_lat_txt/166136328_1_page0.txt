While all the motives for
Chrysler's voluntary pay in-
crease are not announced, it
is clear that it shows the keen
competition that prevails in
American industry. It is an
excellent answer to the claim
of the left wing in govern-
ment and elsewhere that old-
fashioned rivalry has vanished
in big business.
The Chrysler Corp. is one
of our best evidences that the
gate of opportunity in America
is open to vigorous new enter-
prise. It is the youngest of
the big three in the automo-
bile business. It is one of the
youngest among all automobile
producers. It has always
played hard, fair ball in the
race for customers. It frankly
admits that it is in business
to make cars that the public
wants to buy and buy again.
Its record shows that it has
served that purpose well.
A part of the basis of that
service is to build up a loyal,
competent working force. And
this pay boost is designed to
have that sort of employee in
what may be desperate and
trying days ahead. This rise is
certainly no softhearted effort
to turn the establishment into
a private welfare state.
The increase will cost the
company $25,000,000 a year,
which in the face of fierce
competition cannot be reflected
in disproportionately higher
prices for products. Nor can
that sum be taken from
swollen profits, for the finan-
cial statements of the company
do not show any such surplus
fat. The new money must
come from greater production
per man-hour, greater sales
and better and better products.
This major event in the
business world comes in the
midst of an eventful Chrysler
year. This year began with a
dispute with the UAW over
pensions, pay and other issues.
A strike was forced which
lasted 100 days. After its
settlement, an elaborate and
costly pension system was in-
augurated.
Then came the 25th anni-
versary of the company, which
brought to mind once more
the intrepid career of the
founder of the company, Wal-
ter Chrysler. A real mechanic
himself with a genius for
organization, Chrysler entered
a field in which two giants,
Ford and General Motors, were
already operating.
Before the depression de-
scended, the company shoul-
dered its way to third place
in the industry. Since then
it has pioneered in design,
mechanical features and in
selling methods. Walter Chrys-
ler died just before the war,
but the company moved into
the great effort and produced
tanks, trucks and many other
essentials for the government.
It moved from war to peace
with equal energy, and its
present ability to take this
new financial burden shows
how effectively it has met
postwar competition.
Now, with new war efforts
called for, a firm lesson learned
in the last one is apparent.
While both guns and butter
are not assured by Chrysler
and other automobile com-
panies, it is clear that conver-
sion to war work need not
be total. There will be all the
war materiel that the govern-
ment demands, but there will
be products for the public,
too. Not so many as in peace-
time, but a lot.
