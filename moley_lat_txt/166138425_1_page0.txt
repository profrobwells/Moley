THE RELIEF
PITCHER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

What the relief pitcher, Joe
Page, is for Casey Stengel of
the Yankees. So is Gen:
George C. Marshall for Man-
ager Truman.

The rame of Page as a saver
of games is so great that the
very moment he emerges from
the bull pen the spirit of con-
tention oozes from opposition
batsmeh.

True, the Page of 1950 is
not what he used to be. He
has made mistakes and he has
been more and more ineffec-
tive. But the memory of
thrilling ninth innings lingers
on, and Stengel the psychol-
ogist knows that games can
be lost in the subconscious as
well as in the whizzing of
unhittable baseballs. Page is
a Yankee tradition, and the
Yankees' tradition is victory.

Even hardened commenta-
tors, as they inscribe their
comments about the latest re-
versal of the Truman plans—
this time, a plan to keep both
Johnson and Acheson—begin
with a glowing tribute to Mar-
shall the soldier and Chief of
Staff. Then they express the
obvious fact that at last Tru-
man has secured harmony in
his household.

By that time, half the sting
of criticism has been neutral-
ized. To follow with the sug-
gestion that great generals do
not always make great inter-
national policy makes little
impression on readers.

And to say that the harmony
that the President has enforced
in his family is agreement up-
on wrong policy seems a weak
conclusion. That limitation on
critical comment is exactly
what the President intended,
and that is what he will ac-
complish.

But to blunt the sharp edge
of criticism is not the way to
win wars, cold or hot. That
is not how Lincoln turned
the tide after his disasters of
'61 and '62. His search was
for generals and Cabinet mem-
bers who could win new bat-
tles regardless of their past.
Grant's past was not illus-
trious, as we all know. But
his promise was great, and he
won battles.

Our State Department, in
fact, might note that President
Coolidge said that Grant was
a man who "never wasted
time trying to find a substitute
for victory."

Seward started off as Secre-
tary of State with colossal
ineptitude, but with Lincoln's
sound judgment to guide him
he went on to be one of our
greatest makers of internation-
al policy.

The Marshall record of the
war years is not enough to as-
sure his wisdom now. And the
Marshall of 1947-49 was the
chief architect of the deplor-
able loss of Asia. By combin-
ing Marshall and Acheson as
his two major lieutenants, the
President has again shown a
stubborn and dangerous tend-
ency to consolidate his mis-
takes. The elixir of infallibility
induced by the political upset
of 1948 is still working. The
prospects are still dark.

The now former Secretary
Johnson has been an impor-
tant figure in all this. His
original appointment was a re-
ward for routine political serv-
ices. It is not easy to make an
evaluation of his record as
Secretary of Defense, en-
veloped as it has been in a
continuous storm of contro-
versy.. He passes on and, as
with other dismissed Cabinet
members, he must get his re-
wards from philosophical ret-
rospect of his own.

The nation still faces a per-
ilous future which might have
been much, much different ex-
cept for the mistaken policies
of which the President, Ache-
son and Marshall himself were
the exclusive creators.

The hard fact is that it was
Marshall, acting under the or-
ders of the President, advised
by a State Department in
which Acheson was even then
a powerful influence, who
made possible Communist vic-
tory in China.

It was Marshall who disre-
garded the wiser and more ex-
perienced advice of Gen.
Wedemeyer and others in
China. And it was Marshall
who, as Secretary of State, pre-
sided over the policy which
lost us our last chance in Asia.
Peace once more reigns in
the Truman Cabinet, but it is
not a peace that can reassure
an anxious country.
