Bernard Mannes Baruch
shares with Herbert Hoover
the distinction of surviving all
the vicissitudes that have fol-
lowed World War I and, al-
most alone among the notable
figures of that conflict, retain-
ing a commanding influence in
these new times.
In both cases, this capacity
for survival has not been due
to a habit of changing with
the times. Rather, in both
cases, it has been due to con-
sistency. For the proposals
now made by Baruch for eco-
nomic controls have been made
again and again, by him over
the 30-odd years since he first
made them.
There can be some difference
of opinion as to the necessity
of the Baruch controls at this
time, and that will be the sub-
stance of a subsequent issue
of this column. But there can
be no doubt about the effect
that the advice of this man,
who is on the verge of four-
score, has had upon the pres-
ent Congress and upon the
country.
Despite the recommenda-
tions of the President, the
Baruch proposals for an over-
all freeze have been winning
converts among both parties
in Congress, and even the
President has been moved to
accept in principle more pow-
ers than he had asked for.
When President Wilson
made Baruch the head of his
War Industries Board in the
midst of World War I, the
country took note of a new
and unusual figure in national
affairs. Baruch was not an in-
dustrial manager, nor was he
a banker in the conventional
sense of that term.
He had been concerned with
what he frankly called specula-
tion. He was quick, however,
to define his meaning of the
word "speculation" in the clas-
sical sense. It was not mere
betting on the ebb and flow of
prices, nor was it a means of
accumulating wealth through
knowledge not available to
everyone. It was, rather, a
broad and philosophical con-
sideration of economic forces
and trends and a willingness
to take material risks in a free
market.
Many a worthy business
was made sound and produc-
tive by his investment of
money and advice. But when
he entered the service of his
country under Wilson he put
aside considerations of per-
sonal gain and gave freely to
the country the wisdom he
had gained in the market
place.
Those who know him best
have always noted the almost
passionate respect that he
holds for the public as distin-
guished from private interest.
He has been fundamentally a
patriot. For this country had
given him opportunity and the
rewards of personal achieve-
ment. His abiding heroes
were Wilson and his own
father, who was a South Caro-
linian who in the Civil War
became the chief surgeon of
the Confederacy.
Baruch, with little but his
own strength and determina-
tion, came to New York, ac-
quired an education, and en-
tered the world of business
on his own. His fortune has
never been as large as has
been reputed, for he has given
the best of his life to public
service and much of his ma-
terial goods to worthy causes.
Unlike so many who have
attained high place in public
life, he is profoundly devoted
to his friends. Old friends
and associates whose fortunes
have carried them far beyond
any ability to help him are
constantly reminded of his
thoughtfulness and devotion.
Few men who have not at-
tained the temporary glamour
of high office have so fixed
themselves in the public eye
and have so influenced the
course of public affairs. At
80, Baruch is still a force to
be reckoned with.
