Steel Wage Boost Casts
an Inflationary Shadow
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since the increase of 16 cents
an hour for U.S. Steel work-
ers is expected to bring about
a general wage rise through-
out the economy, it is in or-
der to make some estimate of
the over-all costs. Certainly
there will be better arguments
in most lines of employment
than there is in steel.
If it could be conceived that
all employed persons to the
number of 16,000,000 would get
the same increase, the net cost
would be $19,200,000,000. This
is, of course, not likely. But
if we accept a very conserva-
tive estimate and cut the in-
crease to one-third, we have
the very sizable figure of
$6,400,000,000.

This figure, which it is rea-
sonable to expect will follow
upon the heels of the steel
increase, would pay more than
one-third of the entire housing
cost of the nation, which is
$17,200,000,000.
That would include all own-
er-occupied dwellings, tenant-
occupied nonfarm dwellings,
the rental value of farmhous-
es, transient hotels and tour-
ist cabins and clubs, schools
and institutions.
Since most of this housing
cost is more or less fixed, this
one increase in pay would care
for not only the third of the
entire cost of shelter for all
of us, but in the favored lines,
where something like the steel
increase of 16 cents per hour
prevails, it will pay for much
more than a third of the rent
of carrying charges of work-
ers.
This $6,400,000,000 is 8% of
the entire farm income in 1949.
It is nearly 40% of all cor-
porate profits after tax. It is
nearly 90% of all dividends
paid in that year.
Thus, when we hear labor
leaders talking about excess-
profits taxes and taking the
profit out of war and the ex-
cessive incomes of investors,
it might be well to remind
them that they are already on
the way toward a prepayment
of their part on the profits of
the war.

Moreover if we look back
over the eight years ending
with 1949 it will appear very
clearly that wage increases
have been vastly out of line
with all gains in other forms
of income.
Four of those years were in
the war, four have been since
the war. With the year 1939
taken as the base, the wage
increase in the four war years,
1942-45, was $155,700,000,000.
This was 10 times the increase
in the income of corporations
in the same period. If we take
the eight years 1942-50, we find
an increase in wages of about
$500,000,000,000 or half a tril-
lion dollars. This is four times
as much as the net income
of all corporations for the 20
years ending in 1949. It is nine
times the interest and 11 times
the dividends received by in-
dividuals during the eight-year
period.
It is four and two-thirds the
farm income for that period.
These are figures that might
well be kept in mind as we
enter a new period during
which we shall hear recur-
rent claims for more wages to
meet the cost of living. If any-
thing has contributed more to
the cost of living than these
increase in wages, it is diffi-
cult to think of it.
