It is characteristic of the
bureaucratic mind that in an
emergency it always thinks of
ways to prevent people from
doing the wrong things instead
of trying to help them do the
right things.
The present drive for all-
time mobilization is no exception. The suggestion of a war-
time footing brings to mind
only that there is a certain
level of productivity in our
economic system which cannot
be exceeded and in order to
get more things for war we
shall have to lose an equivalent
amount of things for civilian
use.
In the national emergency
nine and a half years ago that
was the assumption. But great
natural forces of productivity,
stimulated by dire necessity,
got under way and we found
that, while we could not have
all the guns and all the butter
we wanted, we were able to
get more of both than any of
the official estimates predicted.
In the present situation it
might be well to have a very
high-ranking agency whose
sole purpose, in co-operation
with management and labor,
would be to devise and suggest
improved methods of efficiency
everywhere in our economic
system. In short, we need a
national policy of productivity.
Some of the methods of increasing productivity, without
increasing manpower or weekly
hours, that suggest themselves
are a reduction of labor turnover, efficiency premiums,
a reduction in the number of
patterns and brands during the
emergency, a counteracting of
the so-called inventory slowdown and simplified packaging.
A study by McGraw-Hill has
shown that improved methods
of materials handling would
save the labor of 650,000 men
a year.
Modernization in methods of
coal mining could be effected
which, it is estimated, would
increase production per man
employed by 30% in three or
four years.
Better textile machinery
could raise output per man-hour
more than 50% in some of
the industry and in the entire
industry by 20%.
In the food-processing industry there are reliable estimates
that 20% improvements might
be made.
Some of these suggestions,
of course, might claim materials that may soon become
unavailable. But others could
be applied in even a total
emergency.
The earlier, however, that we
begin at the job of getting
more with what we have—more
of both military and civilian
goods—the better we can sustain
the burdens of an emergency
that may last for years.
The extension of labor hours
per week can prevent rising
total costs per unit produced.
Improvement of productivity
can reduce unit costs.
Both methods of increasing
output are possible and essential.
