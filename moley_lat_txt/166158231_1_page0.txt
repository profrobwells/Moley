President Truman always
hates to use the word "strike"
in his official pronouncements.
He loves the word "stoppage."
In his recently released eco-
nomic report he said that we
could not afford to have stop-
pages in the basic industries.
He has said nothing about
methods of stopping stoppages,
but we may expect that there
will be plenty of occasions for
that.
There are plenty of stop-
pages now. Sixty per cent of
our soda ash production is tied
up, with no more pressure for
settlement than that which
conciliators can provide.
Also affected in this tie-up
are other highly important
chemicals such as chlorine and
caustic soda. This is about as
basic an industry as there is.
There are many other strikes
in more or less essential in-
dustries.
All the President and his ad-
ministration colleagues can do
is wring their hands. We shall
probably hear very little from
that quarter now about the re-
peal of Taft-Hartley. The fact
is that the President may well
ask for new authority to seize
plants, an authority which he
can already exercise without
new legislation. However, he
will probably try to tie Con-
gress into some new version
of the old authority.
Union leaders are already
talking about some advance
compensation for these possi-
ble compulsions. If there is to
be a wage freeze, there will,
according to them, have to be
something to take the chill off.
Two or three weeks ago, some
labor leaders saw Chairman
Symington of the National Se-
curity Resources Board and, it
is reported, asked that there be
appointed a union leader as
vice-chairman. Symington
seems to have side-stepped
that by appointing as assist-
ants people from the two labor
camps.
It is doubtful if there will
again be a major appointment
such as the designation of Sid-
ney Hillman in the late war to
a copartnership with Knudsen.
That worked so badly that it
is not likely to be repeated.
Double-headed administration
is bad for war as it is bad for
peace.
What this business of put-
ting union officials in defense
posts really amounts to is giv-
ing out government jobs to
people who have official posts
in unions. It is called by the
nice names "partnership" and
"representation." But it is not
that. This sort of appointment
of so-called occupational repre-
sentatives is not democratic
representation but syndical-
ism.
The workers have nothing to
do with the policies these men
carry into government. What-
ever is secured is generally
concessions which help the
leaders in their capacity as
leaders.
Compulsory membership is
one example. This, of course,
relieves union officers from
the work of enlisting members
on a voluntary basis. Higher
dues are exacted, which come
from the workers and the gov-
ernment and add to the power
of the leaders, who use union
funds without real responsibil-
ity.
Moreover, these jobs in the
administration of defense pro-
duction are not properly mat-
ters for occupational inter-
est representation. They are
places for managerial or tech-
nical skill. Union leaders get
into the act not because they
have these qualities but be-
cause in the complicated proc-
esses of labor politics they
have managed to get elected to
high union jobs.
And as the Knudsen-Hillman
matter proved, the whole
thing retards rather than ac-
celerates the effort to mobi-
lize national energy.
