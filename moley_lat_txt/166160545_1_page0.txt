Why Dewey Has Changed
His Mind About Running
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The dread possibility that
the Korean conflict will spread
into a general war puts a tremendous responsibility upon
all American political leaders,
but especially upon those in a
State like New York.
The vulnerability under an
atomic attack of the city of
New York and such upstate
cities as Buffalo, Rochester
and Syracuse is obvious. Vast
concentrations of manufactur-
ing, shipping, finance and
scientific research need very
special protection. Moreover,
the city of New York, partially
closed in by rivers, the
sound and the sea, has limited
exits for its population.
In a great crisis panic might
be worse than actual attack
or sabotage. The outlook is
as serious as can be imagined.
In the face of this challenge,
the need for strong, competent
and experienced people at the
head of the city and State
governments is without doubt
greater than has ever been
present before. Fast preparations for civilian defense need
to be made and, if the crisis
comes, there should be super-
administrators to meet it.
Most specifically, this means
a strong Governor and an able
Mayor of the city of New
York. Both offices are to be
filled at this fall's election.
The selection of the candidates for State offices and a
U.S. Senatorship, as well as
the designation of candidates
for Mayor, takes place this
week.
Gov. Dewey's reluctance to
run and his final decision to
do so only at a personal sacrifice were clearly sincere.
Those who know him best
will testify that his physical
ailment, while not serious, has
been a great burden during
the last year. He has gained
from the Governorship all the
power and glory. From here
on, it is just hard work.
Moreover, Dewey, except for
a short period, has been in
public service and out of the
private practice of law for 20
years. At the age of 50 it
would not be easy to resume
and to accumulate a competence for himself and family. To serve as Governor four
more years would reduce that
chance still further.
It is highly improbable,
moreover, that another Presidential nomination will come,
even if Dewey should want it.
After an examination of all
sides of the case, the inescapable conclusion is that
Dewey made his decision to
run on purely patriotic
grounds, and his State profoundly needs his unquestioned executive ability in the
years ahead.
For the office of Mayor
vacated by William O'Dwyer,
candidates will finally be selected on Sept. 9. Here the
Republicans have a chance to
match Dewey with a strong
candidate.
By every test, that candidate should in these critical
times be Robert Moses, who
has for 30 years held an extraordinary array of offices in
the State and city. He was
the ablest of all Al Smith's
lieutenants. He is the major
builder of the State as well
as the city park system and
of the great Triboro Bridge. He
served 12 years with LaGuardia and four with O'Dwyer.
He should be the Republican candidate, but it is not at
all clear that he will be chosen.
Perhaps the selection of one
able administrator is about all
the Republican Party can offer.
