THE TRAGIC
PHRASE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In my previous column the
point was made that the great
mistake of Roosevelt and
Churchill in adopting the pol-
icy of unconditional surrender
has a profound bearing on the
present crisis. It ought to warn
present policymakers to take
good advice and to co-operate
with the opposition party in
the Senate.

The idea of unconditional
surrender, according to
Churchill in his new book
"The Hinge of Fate," "cropped
up in my official talks with the
President." That was at Casa-
blanca in early 1943.

The incredible manner in
which the phrase popped up
in Roosevelt's mind is told in
a communication to Harry
Hopkins. He said that trying
to get Gens. de Gaulle and
Giraud together made him
think of Grant and Lee. Then
he thought of Grant's phrase
"unconditional surrender."
Then he had a press confer-
ence coming on and since he
always wanted to have some-
thing smart and sensational
for such occasions "and Win-
ston and I had had no time to
prepare for it, the thought
popped into my mind that
they had called Grant 'Old Un-
conditional Surrender,' and
the next thing I knew I had
said it."

*

This is probably the most
extraordinary confession of
carelessness in making a great
decision that is recorded in
history.

As was often the case, even
Roosevelt's knowledge of his-
tory was faulty for, while
Grant used the term, the sur-
render of Ft. Donaldson was
not unconditional.

Churchill confesses that he
had some surprise when he
heard Roosevelt announce the
term at the press conference.
Gen. Ismay was also surprised,
as was undoubtedly almost
every sane observer every-
where, especially those who
could remember Wilson's quite
different policy in the first
war. And to avoid any charge
of second guessing now, it is
a matter of record that this
writer noted, at the time, not
only surprise but dismay.

Churchill now, in his his-
tory, would like to escape re-
sponsibility and he makes it
clear that while he supported
the statement, he did so be-
cause "any divergence between
us . . . would . . . have been
damaging to the war effort."

But it was important, so
gravely important that it may
change the whole course of
civilization for the worse. It
was important enough to give
Hitler and Goebbels exactly
what they wanted to solidify
the German people behind
them. It prolonged the war
because it made it impossible
for the enemies of the Nazi
leadership to overthrow that
regime.

Together with the malig-
nant Morgenthau plan which
Churchill and Roosevelt ini-
tialed with equally careless
abandon, it provided the ma-
terial with which the Nazi
gangsters whipped their peo-
ple into frenzy and despera-
tion. It removed the only
two nations in Europe and
Asia strong enough to stop
Russia. And most tragic of
all it cost tens of thousands of
American lives.

The Senate and especially
the opposition in the Senate
should keep this lesson in
mind as a new crisis arrives.
