This would be a poor time
to bring up the greatest mis-
take of the last war except for
the fact that its consideration
can greatly help us to avoid
similar mistakes in the alto-
gether too near future.
The adoption of the policy
of unconditional surrender,
we now see in blinding light,
was that greatest mistake. For
it stiffened the resistance of
Germany and Japan, length-
ened the war and reduced the
two natural bastions against
Communism to their present
impotence.
We now have it from re-
liable sources that in those
two enemy countries it might
have been possible to over-
throw their gangster leaders
cured peace more than a year
earlier.
We now have it from
Churchill himself in his new
definitive history that this
world-shaking policy was
made with almost unbelieva-
ble casualness.
Let us consider the facts and
draw the lessons before once
more a President wielding
great power and indifferent to
counsel moves us further to-
ward catastrophe.
Churchill in his "The Hinge
of Fate" recounts the story
of the phrase in a tone which
might well be interpreted as
proceeding from an uneasy
conscience.
In a message to Churchill
suggesting the plans for the
Casablanca conference early
in 1943, Roosevelt said: "In
view of Stalin's absence, I
think you and I need no for-
eign affairs people with us, for
our work will be essentially
military."
This was a clear refusal to
recognize diplomatic action. It
was also a flat rejection of the
wisdom or duty to include
any representatives of the
Senate or the opposition par-
ty in such a momentous con-
ference. It was Wilson's Ver-
sailles blunder all over again,
since it came almost immedi-
ately after an election in
which the administration had
suffered a sharp rebuff at the
polls. In that respect it is
like this present moment in
1950.
Churchill on the other hand
was always thinking of his op-
ponent in Parliament, for he
puts into his record long mes-
sages to Deputy Prime Minis-
ter Attlee, telling of what had
been done, what was proposed
to do, and asking for advice
and consent from his triparti-
san War Cabinet.
After the war leaders got to
Casablanca and were comfort-
ably installed in villas there
were some casual chats be-
tween them on gigantic issues
of policy. Somehow the
phrase "unconditional surren-
der" cropped up, for Churchill
mentions it in a message to
Attlee asking that the War
Cabinet consider the idea and
to advise as to what they
thought of it.
His discussion of uncondi-
tional surrender and its les-
sons for us will continue in
the next issue of this column.
