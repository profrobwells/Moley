Pressman Sheds Light
on the Early New Deal
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is a great deal in Lee
Pressman's testimony before
the House Committee on Un-
American Activities that clari-
fies conditions and events in
New Deal Washington in the
early Roosevelt years.
Roosevelt had hardly been
installed in office before a
swarm of young lawyers, ap-
peared in Washington. They
came in the main on the recom-
mendation of professors in
various law schools, among
which Harvard attained some
notoriety. A sort of esprit de
corps developed among them.
One of the leaders in this re-
cruitment used to call them a
"well integrated group."
For the most part they were
a zealous lot eager to make
over the laws and the ma-
chinery of government closer
to their hearts' desire. They
were definitely and militantly
antibusiness and pro-big gov-
ernment.
Since there was a great con-
fusion down there at the time
and a strong demand for law-
yers in all departments, these
men attained very considerable
power in drafting legislation.
It is well remembered by
this writer, who knew only a
few of these people personally
but some of their sponsors
well, that there was great im-
patience among them with
Roosevelt. He was moving too
slowly, they thought.
Some, as was testified at the
time, regarded Roosevelt as a
Kerensky. At such moments
of irritation there would be
threats that the whole "group"
would resign in a body, which
was somewhat humorous,
since it was clear that they
would never leave Washington
voluntarily. They had nowhere
else to go and they were al-
ready having a fine time.

It ought to be stated here,
and it is done with full knowl-
edge that these people, curi-
ously enough, never liked
Henry Wallace and Rex Tug-
well, who were then excoriated
by conservatives as the arch
radicals.
Several of these well-spon-
sored lawyers got into the
Treasury Department in 1933
under the sympathetic wing of
Dean Acheson, then Undersec-
retary. After Acheson left the
Treasury and Morgenthau
came in, most or all of them
were ousted.
Another group moved into
the agricultural adjustment ad-
ministration. As Pressman's
testimony shows, Pressman
and at least two others named
as former Communists were in
that group. Hiss was also there.
For reasons that were never
clear to me, trouble arose in
the Department of Agriculture,
and in 1935 Wallace fired the
whole group, including Frank.
Such purges were never real
banishments from the govern-
ment, because the people dis-
charged found jobs waiting in
other departments and
bureaus. Ultimately, many of
them rose to highly responsible
positions.

Pressman's plaint that he
joined the Communist Party
because "the future looked
black for my generation" has a
very hollow sound. He and his
conferees had received excel-
lent educations in first-class
colleges and law schools main-
tained by the capitalists whom
they apparently wanted to de-
stroy. They had also received
jobs far beyond their merits at
the hands of the Democratic
Party. So they joined the Com-
munist Party, dedicated to de-
stroy capitalism, the Demo-
cratic Party and the constitu-
tional system under which
they had been protected since
childhood. These were fine
people to attempt what Press-
man describes as "an improve-
ment of economic conditions
here at home."
And what of the judgment
of their sponsors, some of
whom have risen very high
indeed?
