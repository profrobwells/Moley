Congress Should Limit
Lending Power of RFC
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In abruptly reversing him-
self on the reform of the Re-
construction Finance Corp.,
President Truman has shown
that public and Congressional
opinion can break through
the hitherto incorrigible stub-
bornness of the man. For his
defiance of the Fulbright rec-
ommendations by renominat-
ing three directors of the
corporation, his crude and un-
seemly characterization of the
Fulbright report as "asinine"
and his expressed confidence
in the persons who have made
a great institution a mess of
favoritism and politics were
affronts to public standards of
official morality.

The President's conversion
to one reform suggested by
the Fulbright subcommittee
---that the board of directors
be replaced by a single head
---will ease the heat temporari-
ly. But we shall have to
know a great deal more be-
fore any confidence is restored
in the financial activities of
the Federal administration.

We shall have to know
whether the RFC is to he
limited in its lending to the
needs of this present emer-
gency. That is clearly the
only purpose for which loans
should hereafter be made. We
shall have to know whether
the President intends to nomi-
nate just another crony, or
a routine bureaucrat, or a
needy politician to the new
job. We shall have to know
whether the people in the out-
fit who have been working
with fixers outside are to be
cleaned out.

It is rumored that the Presi-
dent will nominate W. Elmer
Harber, the present chairman,
for the post. There was no
criticism of Harber himself in
the report, but it is notewor-
thy that we heard nothing
from him of an effort to re-
form things until after the
Fulbright blast. The condi-
tions which were criticized
were well known long before,
particularly during the Ful-
bright, hearings. And the "re-
forms" announced by Harber
were feeble gestures.

The Senate should refuse
to confirm anyone but a full-
sized, experienced business-
man whose capacity is above
question. And Congress
should force a limitation on
the lending power of the
agency. There are only two
sound constitutional grounds
on which the RFC can stand.
It can act as an essential aid
to national defense. And it
can, under the great opinion
of Chief Justice Marshall in
the case of McCullough vs.
Maryland in 1819, keep itself
in readiness to aid banks in
distress.

In that decision the consti-
tutionality of the Bank of the
United States was upheld, be-
cause the bank was designed
to be "necessary and proper"
for the execution of the fiscal
powers of the government.
Loans to railroads might be
justified under the interstate
commerce clause. But indis-
criminate lending to indus-
tries and businesses not cov-
ered by these Congressional
grants of power is of very
doubtful constitutionality, al-
though the matter has never
been tested in the Supreme
Court. Since there would be
little reason, however, for ex-
pecting the present Supreme
Court to place any limits on
anything, Congress should
place its own limits.

There is also no good eco-
nomic reason for indiscrim-
inate loans to businesses. Help
to some of the past bene-
ficiaries has been ludicrous,
such as to hotels, a snake
farm, and the like.

Is Congress to authorize
the use of taxpayers' money
to make loans only for pur-
poses which banks, with plen-
ty of money to lend, regard
as unsound investments? If
so, where can the limit be
placed?

These changes in faces will
not suffice. It is time to re-
member that we are, after all,
ruled by a constitution and
not by President Truman.
