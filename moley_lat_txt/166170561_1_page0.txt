SPECTER OF
INFLATION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We have been told, both in
the near past and early in the
recent world war, of the various
stages in the great economic
disease of inflation.
The first stage consists of
selective and sharp rises in
specific commodities and other
properties. This is never serious
because the action of a free
market brings readjustment.
The second phase is a general
rise in prices and wages and,
because of increased costs of
living, a shrinkage of savings.
In this stage it becomes more
difficult to sell government
bonds and other securities with
fixed incomes. Also in this
stage, common stocks and
commodities and most real
estate rise, since people seek a
hedge in things that rise as
the value of the dollar falls.
The third stage is based
upon a genuine psychology of
fear. People unload, helter-
skelter, all possessions with a
fixed value. They are afraid of
keeping money, or securities
with fixed returns. Bonds fall
in value, especially government
bonds. Hoarding, often silly
and irrelevant, takes place.
Since the psychology upon
which this is based rises with
cumulative force, the end may
be disaster such as that which
overtook Germany in the great
inflation of the 1920s.
In the second world war, we
moved into the second of these
phases, but never came close to
the third. After the war, we
moved further into the second
phase, but by 1948 the tide
turned. The increased productive
capacity of the country saved us.
Also, we saw the Federal
budget come into balance.
Sanity prevailed. Labor, realizing
that further wage increases
were going to be harder to
justify, turned to demands for
pensions and other benefits.
These latter were long-term
dangers, it is true, but the
effects were not serious in
terms of immediate price
increases.
In the last year or so, however,
the whole danger has revived.
President Truman, under such
influences as that of Leon
Keyserling, his chief economic
adviser, has stirred the
smoldering embers. He has
talked big figures of a national
income—an income which is
not justified by the prospect of
more production, but by inflated
prices and incomes.
He has resolutely refused to
curb extravagance in government
expenditures. Probably for
political reasons, he has encouraged
certain elements in labor to
demand more wage increases.
And he has contributed directly
by such outpourings of money
as the veterans’ insurance bonus.
The danger of accelerating
the action of inflation has increased
with the Korean war. Nobody
hopes for a real cut in non-
military expenditures. Tax-and-
spend Congressmen are still
demanding and getting their
special appropriations. The
public has little confidence in
the strange system of price
control that has been adopted.
Labor is militantly against
wage control, while it demands
control of prices and profits.
Foreign capital is showing signs
of a flight from the dollar such
as the one which prevailed in
1933. We are hearing of the
flight of foreign money to
Uruguay and Tangier. In
August, there were more E
Bonds cashed than were sold by
the Treasury. These and other
accelerants and symptoms are
disturbing people to a degree
that might become very serious.
