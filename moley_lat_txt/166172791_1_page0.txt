Thirty-six years ago, when
I entered Columbia University
as a graduate student, I first
met John Joseph Lenney, who
enrolled the same year in the
same courses.
Lenney was older than the
other graduate students. He
was 44.
At the age of 24 he enlisted
in the Regular Army. He
served in various commands
and rose finally to the rank
of quartermaster-sergeant in
the cavalry. He served in the
Philippines during the Span-
ish-American War and later
in the suppression of the in-
surrection.
He received a Philippine Con-
gressional Medal, was honor-
ably discharged in 1899 and,
while he was recommended
"for consideration" for a com-
mission, he never received one.
Then for 14 years he worked
in various places and acquired
a college and law school edu-
cation. Finally, in 1914, ap-
parently with some modest
means of his own, he turned
to what he had determined to
make his life's mission.
That mission, as he ex-
plained it to us at Columbia,
was to establish by long re-
search his contention that the
U.S. Army, supposed to be the
military arm of a democratic
nation, was in fact a most un-
democratic institution. He pro-
posed to show that, despite
repeated actions by Congress
over the years designed to per-
mit worthy enlisted men to
rise to the rank of officers, that
desirable end had not been at-
tained. It had, he said then,
been frustrated by the War
Department and the high com-
mand.
I lost track of Lenney after
his two or three years' resi-
dence at Columbia. But he
never gave up his purpose.
Years of labor in the archives
followed, and in 1926 he com-
pleted his preliminary re-
search. He had assembled, by
that year 43,000 biographical
records of Army officers and
compiled many tables and
charts. These were printed
in the records of the 73rd and
74th Congresses. In 1940 he
gave all these data to the gov-
ernment, and they now repose
in the Archives Building in
Washington.
Now in his 81st year, Len-
ney has finished his job.
His two books are "Caste
System in the American
Army" and "Rankers, the
Odyssey of the Enlisted Sol-
dier in America and Britain."
Together, they are a chal-
lenge to the high command,
especially now that we are
again building a great Army.
For they prove that, despite
the wealth of officer material
among enlisted men, there has
been wholly inadequate effort
to use that material. The
Army of this democratic na-
tion is still commanded by of-
ficers who, however gallant
and capable, have not come
from the ranks.
