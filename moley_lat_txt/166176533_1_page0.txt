HOUSTON — The name of
Jesse Jones will always be a
bright spot in the history of
the city of Houston, just as
it will be in that immense
creation of government, the
Reconstruction Finance Corp.
The city of Houston, with
Jones still an active citizen,
was never doing better. The
RFC, from which Jones de-
parted six years ago, was nev-
er in a worse plight.
It is not without deep regret
that Jones is hearing of what
the Fulbright committee is re-
vealing about politics, person-
al exploitation, and terrible
business judgment in the big
government lending agency.
But it can hardly be said that
he is surprised.
*
In fact, as he recently indi-
cated in a letter to Sen. Byrd,
he believes that we have not
heard the worst of it yet. And
over the years since he left
Washington Jones has con-
sistently warned Congress and
the public of what might be
expected in such an institution
once it has outlived the pur-
pose for which it was created.
Four years ago Jones said
that the RFC should be put
in deep freeze until another
emergency should make it
necessary to use government
credit to stabilize a shaky eco-
nomic system.
He said that it should be re-
duced to a skeleton organiza-
tion with no further lending
and with sufficient staff merely
to liquidate its outstanding
loans. One reason for this opin-
ion was that sufficient credit
was available from private
sources, including the banks
and insurance companies, to
deal with business needs. An-
other was that it becomes pro-
gressively more difficult to find
competent people to direct
such a government institution
after the emergency which
created it has passed.
Such weak leadership can-
not stand up against political
pressure, and scandals are
bound to develop. This advice
of Jones was ignored by Con-
gress, and the results predicted
became a stark reality. Then,
two years later, as RFC mis-
management became a nation-
al scandal, Jones told Sen. Ful-
bright that there could be no
halfway measures. The RFC
should be scrapped, lock, stock
and barrel. Congress was still
hesitant to abolish such a con-
venient source of patronage.
Jesse Jones, of course, had
to contend with political pres-
sure when he was directing
the RFC. And some of that
pressure came from the White
House itself. But the canny
Texan was able to frustrate
such efforts without an oper-
break.
When recommendations
came from high political
sources Jones generally got
them in writing and thus built
for himself a protective rec-
ord. He was also able to resort
to interminable delay when a
proposition represented an un-
sound business risk. In any
event, he protected the pub-
lic interest and public money
for 12 long years.
As everybody knows, Jones
was appointed by President
Hoover to the RFC when it
was created in 1932. He was
not made chairman until the
following year. Hoover, who
had to contend with a Demo-
cratic House that year, secured
the enactment of the neces-
sary legislation by calling in
for co-operation House and
Senate leaders, including John
N. Garner, who was then
Speaker of the House.
*
Then, when the Democratic
appointments were made, he
gave those leaders a voice in
the selection. According to
Garner’s account, President
Hoover offered him four
names of Texans from which
to make a selection. Jones was
on the list and Garner imme-
diately named him.
Garner, who was no novice
in business himself, knew that
Jones would guard govern-
ment money as well as he had
protected his own many in-
vestments. And his judgment
was correct.
Congress, which in many in-
stances in the past has fol-
lowed the wise advice of Jesse
Jones, might well do so in this
case. That advice is to give
the RFC an unceremonious
burial before more taxpayers’
money is wasted.
