'LIBERALS'
AND REDS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the debate and in the
votes on the so-called McCar-
ran anti-Communist bill a num-
ber of self-styled "liberals" did
a great deal to reveal the utter
confusion of their minds. They
fought to the end to sustain
the President's veto, and lost.
The basis of their objections,
aside from some technical
criticisms, was that this bill,
now happily the law of the
land, represented hysteria,
Red-hunting or what-will-you.
In the eyes of an old-fash-
ioned radical like Sen. Langer,
it was like the anti-Red cam-
paign of Atty. Gen. A. Mitchell
Palmer at the end of and just
after the first world war, 30-
odd years ago.
Those who remember the
Palmer activities will agree
with Langer that in 1919 the
threat of Communism was far
less than the danger of ill-
advised efforts to restrict free-
dom.

Those who opposed the Pal-
mer efforts then were no doubt
moved by principles of gen-
uine liberalism. For there was
then and there always is a
danger from selfish people who
exploit public fear to use the
ax on people they do not like.
But the true liberal should
take into account the vast dif-
ference between 1919 and 1950.
In 1919 the Stalins and Molo-
tovs were fresh from the cel-
lars and jails of revolution.
They were holding such power
as they had by the veritable
skin of their teeth. Now they
are astride two continents,
pushing their hirelings into
the vitals of every free coun-
try, including the United
States.
Our nation is facing a peril
vastly greater than ever be-
fore. The McCarran bill rep-
resents an effort to preserve
internal safety by methods
based on long study and in-
vestigation and through de-
bate in Congress.

Some of the members of
Congress other than Langer
can hardly attribute their op-
position to nostalgic recollec-
tions. Many of them are too
young to offer any such ex-
cuse. That applies particularly
to Helen Gahagan Douglas and
F. D. Roosevelt Jr. It also ap-
plies to Sen. Hubert Hum-
phrey, who led the futile fil-
ibuster against overriding the
President's veto. Humphrey
was 8 years old in 1919. His
self-styled "liberalism" is of a
new variety — a type which
has been called "neo-liberal-
ism."
The Humphrey kind of lib-
eralism consists in the main of
support of any and every meas-
ure designed to enlarge the
power of the government and
to restrict the area of individ-
ual freedom. It is also liberal
with spending tax money on
assorted welfare activities.

Humphrey was until last
April chairman of Americans
for Democratic Action. In the
course of his many Senatorial
ramblings, he made a violent
attack on the Reader's Digest
because it had said some un-
complimentary things about
the ADA.
Humphrey, according to his
story, had demanded that the
magazine publish an article of
his own. The editor refused.
So the Senator spread his com-
plaint on the floor of the Sen-
ate. In the course of his attack
he quoted with approval a de-
mand earlier made by Sen.
Morse, who also had a grudge
against the Reader's Digest.
Morse proposed that the Bu-
chanan Lobbying Committee
bring the magazine before it.
And so these two self-styled
liberals, because the free press
prints something they do not
like, would bring the press
generally within the power of
Congress. They would do this
on the fantastic assumption
that the publication of opin-
ions in the magazine is lobby-
ing.
If this be liberalism, then
free men will have to find an-
other word to describe their
faith.
