Planners Would Ration
Meat, but to What End?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are indications too
strong to doubt that meat ra-
tioning is again under prepara-
tion in Washington. The official
view of the Department of
Agriculture opposes this, but
it may be unable to head it
off.
A first move has been made
by the Economic Stabilization
Agency. This is to freeze the
number of meat slaughterers
at present levels. The explana-
tion of this is that the agency
wants to prevent the reappear-
ance of the tens of thousands
of "amateur packers" of for-
mer war days.
It is hardly necessary to re-
call the dreadful mess that
meat rationing produced in the
late war. Black markets at one
time accounted for nearly half
of the meat consumed. The
number of animals that passed
through "Federally inspected
slaughterhouses" shrank
from month to month. The
new "packers," many of whom
went into the business with
easy consciences, proceeded
without bookkeeping.
It was estimated that 20,000
of these businesses appeared
in 1944 and 1945. At the same
time the practice of storing
meat in lockers grew.

In these irregular packing
houses, great waste prevailed.
Hides which were greatly
needed in many industries
were either ruined or passed
into the black market. Thus, a
by-product was shortages and
high prices in leather goods.
At this time there is every
indication that meat rationing
is not needed. The Department
of Agriculture expects a very
substantial increase in pig pro-
duction. In 1950 it rose to a
point 9% higher than in 1949.
The estimate for this year is
for a further rise of 5%.
The cattle population in-
creased in 1950 by 3,000,000,
which brought it far above nor-
mal. It was only 2,000,000 or
3,000,000 below the record year
1945.

The carryover of feed sup-
plies will be less than a year
ago, since in 1949 we had a
record grain crop. If the grain
production prospects are low-
er in 1951, there will be a larg-
er slaughter of animals.
This will happen despite ef-
forts of the government to in-
crease animal production. To
decrease consumption by ra-
tioning would create a situa-
tion giving every encourage-
ment to dangerous black mar-
keting.
Rationing would, of course,
be a great hardship for the big
legitimate meat distributors.
In the face of this threat, their
course should be to keep prices
as low as possible on the proc-
essing level as well as in the
wholesale and retail markets.
For it will be rising prices
which will give the Washing-
ton planners exactly what they
need as an excuse for the regi-
mentation they anticipate so
eagerly.
