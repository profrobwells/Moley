Annuity Tax Amounts
to a Fine on Self-help
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Apparently the "little
people" for whom the heart of
the Fair Deal bleeds are not
the "little people" who try to
help themselves. The Fair
Deal and its predecessor, the
New Deal, viewed in the light
of long term events, have in
fact interpreted the meaning
of their generalities about the
"underprivileged" and the
"common man" according to
the caprice of politics. Those
who have gained the greatest
benefits are minorities able to
pay in votes.
For the generality of worthy
people of small means, there
have been callous neglect and
increasing burdens. Inflation-
ary policies have taken from
the left pocket of pensioners
what government has put in
the right pocket. The value of
the dollar has been steadily de-
pressed. A cheap money policy
has consistently threatened the
living standards of millions of
small annuitants, pensioned
teachers, policemen, firemen
and other civil servants, wid-
ows, and retired workers of
all sorts.
Eighty-three million people
in this country have life in-
surance, and the total amount
of their protection is $230,000,-
000,000. A great number of
these are poor and moderately
poor but frugal people who
have made unquestionable sac-
rifices for the benefit of their
families and their future. Surely,
they should merit the deep
solicitude of any popular gov-
ernment.

Not the first but the most re-
cent of the many injustices
done to these people was a sec-
tion in the 1950 revenue bill,
prepared by the Treasury, de-
signed to tax the proceeds of
life insurance policies. This
proposed assault on savings
was actually passed by the
House.
This proposal of the Truman
administration—professed
friend of the "little man"—pro-
vided that when insurance
proceeds were to be paid over
a series of years, a part of each
payment should be taxed as
regular income.

Since most beneficiaries are
middle-aged or elderly people,
it is easy to see that the bene-
ficiary may die before he re-
ceives the principal, upon
which an estate tax may al-
ready have been paid. It is al-
so clear that the income from
which premiums had been
paid was also taxed.
The Treasury's claim that
such policies were so drawn to
escape income taxes was gross-
ly unfair. Such provision for
installments was made in thou-
sands of cases before there
was an income tax, for the
simple reason that people who
bought such insurance want-
ed to protect the security of
their wives or other depend-
ents in their old age.

In 1934, Congress under the
benign influence of President
Roosevelt amended the law to
provide for the taxation of an-
nuities to the extent of 3% of
the amount paid for the annu-
ity. This was also a gross in-
justice, since under the pres-
sure of the administration, in-
terest rates were progressive-
ly pushed downward.
Meanwhile, the Federal gov-
ernment set up Social Security,
which provides for nontaxable
pensions up to $150 a month.
Thus, the private saver who
makes provision for himself is
taxed to support those who
have not done so.
There is also the fact that
the Federal government by
driving down interest rates has
compelled insurance compa-
nies to raise the cost of annuity
policies, thus making it harder
and harder for anyone to pro-
tect his old age by self-help.
These are some of the real-
ities hidden by the white fleece
of the welfare state.
