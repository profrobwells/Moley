'Excess Profits Tax' Is
a Deceiving Expression
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Like many political slogans
the term "excess profits tax"
has an alluring sound but it
does not mean what it says.
It is alluring because it
seems perfectly fair to take
excessive profits by taxation.
Nobody ought to enjoy an ex-
cess of profits any more than
an excess of anything. For the
word "excess" means what is
more than fair, or sound, or
safe,
And it evokes a strong moral
sentiment. Nobody ought to
make a profit out of war, since
to so many war means take
everything, even life itself.

The demand for the hasty
enactment of an excess-profits
tax was so great in the last
week of the adjourned session
of Congress that it was only
the great effort of Sen. George
and others, coupled with a
promise to take up the matter
at the next session, which pre-
vented the passage half-
baked legislation. The plan
proposed would have done
great injury to the economy
and certainly would not have
captured real excess war
profits.
Now with the moment ap-
proaching when the promise
of Sen. George is coming due,
the question of new taxation
becomes insistent. It would be
utter folly for Congress to en-
act such a tax in the rush of
this resumed session. For
scores of witnesses have a
right to be heard and a matter
so serious must be debated at
length.

The proposal of Treasury
Secretary Snyder clearly indi-
cates how far removed from
certainty and reality is the
thinking of the administration
at this moment. For the Sec-
retary's proposal is not a spe-
cific tax on war profits at all.
It is a partially compromised
tax on all profits, war and non-
war, defense and nondefense.
And to make it seem fair, it
is not a tax designed to take
all the profit from war con-
tracts but only a part of such
profits.
Perhaps this proposal is
merely a continuation of the
President's habit of setting up
a beautiful objective and then
implementing his idea with
specific details so bad that
Congress cannot accept them.
Then after Congress has re-
jected his specific plan, he ac-
cuses Congress of destroying
his objective as well.

This is a pretty shoddy way
to play politics with a great
national crisis, but it has had
precedents in the past actions
of this administration,
The so-called excess-profits
tax of World War II is still
unintelligible both to the tax-
payer and the tax collector.
That tax attempted to fix the
normal profits of a corpora-
tion on the basis of what was
earned in the years 1936-39.
But where does that leave
the companies that were just
getting started in those years
— companies whose business
had nothing to do with war
production? If, after the hard
years of getting under way,
they began to make even a
moderate profit during the war
years, that profit would be re-
garded as excessive. The best
proof of the confusion caused
by this unworkable and unfair
law is that thousands of cases
are still pending.

There is a better way to cap-
ture the specific war profits—
in fact two ways that could
operate jointly. One is the pro-
cess of renegotiating contracts,
thus saving the government
the cost of contracts beyond a
fair return.
The other is a corporation
defense tax. This would fix the
normal corporation tax rate at
18% with the surtax at 20%.
Then a new defense tax could
be imposed as a percentage of
the total corporation tax paid.
This is a fair way to make
sure that nobody makes an
unfair profit on a crisis that
may run for years to come.
