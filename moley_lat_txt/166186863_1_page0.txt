Heavy Taxes Penalize
New Business Ventures
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is very significant that
President Truman suggests,
without being very specific,
that new revenue to meet his
huge budget must come from
something other than person-
al and corporation incomes.
There are hints of sales taxes,
manufacturers' excise taxes,
"plugging loopholes," and oth-
er means of passing on the
burden to consumers who are,
after all, mostly in the lower-
income groups.
This must come hard to as
seasoned a politician as the
President. For the picture
painted by spend-and-elect
politicians is always that of
fat cats with pockets stuffed
with dividends who, after all,
will foot the bills. Also, the
labor leaders claim that all
things can be paid out of prof-
its. The facts of economic life
must be dawning upon these
exploiters of popular misun-
derstanding.
*
Let us examine some of
those facts, which justify the
expression "vanishing rich."
For purposes of comparison
of incomes, I use 1927 and
1947. The first of these years
is used because it was the last
fairly normal year before
the boom and the bust. The
year 1947 is used because it is
the last year for which we
have figures for both personal
incomes and fiduciaries.
In the two decades between
1927 and 1947, all incomes over
$5000 increased 187%. All in-
comes over $10,000 increased
103%. All incomes over $50,000
increased only 13%. Above
that, diminishing returns were
in order. If we take incomes
over $100,000 as a definition
of "rich," then the number
of rich declined 18%. The very
rich, over $500,000, declined
55%.
*
These figures show a steady
approach of the time when
the "rich" will have no in-
comes at all. And it must be
noted that these figures were
raised on the plus side by
many salary incomes such as
those of movie stars, pro-
ducers, etc., which do not rep-
resent return on investments.
The very rich—over $500,000
—received 1.3% of the nation-
al income in 1927. In 1947, this
proportion declined to one-
fifth of 1%.
The figures on "income from
dividends" show, moreover,
that dividends are either not
the lush source of income that
is generally supposed or
that dividend-paying stocks
are passing from the rich to
the moderately well off.
Between 1927 and 1947, "in-
come from dividends" received
by those making over $500,000
declined 48%. Such "income
from dividends" received by
all others over $5000 did not
increase as did their incomes,
but rose by only 2%.
If for a basis of compari-
son we go back to 1916, the
last happy year before we
became a participant in world
wars, the decline of the rich
is still more striking.
*
From 1916 to 1947 the in-
come before tax of those re-
ceiving over $5000 rose 612%,
while their income after tax
increased 464%. For those re-
ceiving over $100,000, income
after tax declined 36%. For
those receiving over $500,000,
the income before tax declined
40%, but after tax it declined
71%.
It should be added that divi-
dends paid by corporations in-
creased 36% from 1927 to 1947
while there was this very
great decline in the dividends
received by the rich.
A very important reason is
the heavy double taxation of
corporate profits. It is simply
unprofitable for the rich to in-
vest in corporate stocks.
A new corporation would
have to make 29% on its capi-
tal before taxes for a man in
the highest tax bracket to get
1% return on his investment.
In short, he would net $1 out
of $29 on his investment in
the stock of such a corpora-
tion. The other $28 would go
to the Federal government.
Thus, it is clear that new
corporations, which represent
initiative and the prospect of
greatly increasing national
wealth and well-being, are de-
nied at the outset the golden
opportunity of interesting men
of large means in their future.
They must start with many
handicaps, but this represents
one of their greatest obstacles
to success. For new corpora-
tions need venture capital, and
those who have or have had
money to venture are prac-
tically barred from helping
them.
If any proof is needed that
there was what one admirer
named the "Roosevelt Revolu-
tion," the foregoing provides
that evidence.
