Reactions to last week's
speech by John Foster Dulles
make it clear that, whatever
may have been his purpose in
making it, he failed to check
the immense response to Her-
bert Hoover's statement of for-
eign policy.
The average listener found
It difficult to detect any funda-
mental difference of opinion
between the two men. For
Dulles is not a very clear ex-
positor of thought, and since
in this speech he was warily
avoiding conflict with either
of two irreconcilable views, he
was more vague than usual.
To be perfectly frank, he fum-
bled his entire assignment.
It is reliably reported that
Dulles was well aware of the
intention of the State Depart-
ment to announce his speech
as an "answer" to Hoover.
Then, after the newspapers
carried that announcement to
the public prior to his speech,
he sent a telegram to Hoover
disclaiming any such inten-
tion. He thus projected him-
self into a political no man's
land, a situation which many
people think he has occupied
ever since he joined the State
Department.
In accepting an advisory
post under the President and
Secretary of State, Dulles be-
came just another agent of
the administration, just as
Warren Austin did in accept-
ing appointment to the Securi-
ty Council. And when Dulles
became a member of the ad-
ministration, he virtually end-
ed his usefulness to his former
Republican colleagues in the
Senate. This was a distinct
loss to the Republicans and to
the country, for he has the
knowledge and the background
for a real contribution.
The opponents of Hoover
drew great satisfaction from
Dulles' rather indirect repudi-
ation of Hoover's thesis. For
example, there was his state-
ment that "a United States
which could be an inactive
spectator while barbarians
overran and desecrated the
cradle of our Christian civili-
zation could not be the kind of
a United States that could de-
fend itself."
But an examination of Hoo-
ver's speech reveals no advice
to remain an "inactive specta-
tor," while Europe perishes.
What Hoover said was that we
should expect energetic action
by European countries in their
own defense "before we land
another man or another dollar
on their shores." But we
should, with the co-operation
of Britain, give all of our air
and sea power to the defeat
of Communism. What Hoover
was pleading for was that we
should avoid another Korea
on the continent of Europe.
Now let us see what Dulles
thinks about the wisdom of
committing ground troops in
Korea. He said: "In Korea,
the U.N. forces suffer the grave
handicap of trying to repel an
aggressor within the limited
area he selected for an attack,
at the time he selected, and
with methods of war which
are dictated by the terrain and
the weather he selected.
But we instinctively feel that
there is something wrong
about the methods and do not
want to be committed to a se-
ries of Koreas all around the
globe." That instinct is quite
sound.
In short, the Korean adven-
ture must not be repeated. But
what assurance does Dulles
offer that it will not be re-
peated?
If we regard, as we should,
the Hoover speech as a warn-
ing to Europe rather than as
a disclaimer of interest in Eu-
rope, it is much more likely to
move Europe than is anything
that either Dulles or Truman
might say. And it is results,
after all, that concern us.
