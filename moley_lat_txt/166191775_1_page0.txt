Fiscal Year May Close
• Without Federal Deficit
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman is likely
to do a great deal of backing
and filling about new taxes in
the next calendar year or two.
Already two different inter-
pretations can be put on White
House statements on the sub-
ject.
Reliable bank economists
and others seriously doubt
that there will be any deficit
at all in fiscal 1951, which
ends next June. This forecast
is based upon a number of
factors. One is that the large
new appropriations for de-
fense cannot be spent in fiscal
1951. Another is that under the
excess profits law, which
seems quite certain to pass,
about $2,000,000,000 will come
in within six months.
A final and most important
reason is that in a period of
inflation such as this, the dol-
lar figures of the national in-
come rise and thus provide
more taxes under existing
rates. But, as has been proved
over and over, when the na-
tional income rises, the re-
ceipts from taxes rise at a
more rapid rate.
★
In past years, that is why
President Truman's January
estimates were much lower
than actual receipts eight or
nine months later. We can ex-
pect this to happen again.
Secretary of the Treasury
Snyder estimated before a
Congressional committee the
other day that Federal expend-
itures in fiscal 1951 would
be about $45,000,000,000 and
that receipts under present
rates would be $13,000,000,000.
The new excess profits tax
will make up the difference.
And even if an expenditure
of $50,000,000,000 is reached
for fiscal 1951, the prospective
rise in the national income
will bring in an additional
$1,000,000,000.
For fiscal 1952 the story will
be different. Wesley Lindow,
vice-president of the Irving
Trust Co., predicts that if on
Jan. 1, 1952, our expenditures
for defense and military aid
are $35,000,000,000, we shall be
able to balance fiscal 1952 with
a $57,000,000,000 tax income ac-
cording to present laws and
$5,000,000,000 from new taxes.
If our defense and military
aid goes up to $45,000,000,000,
we shall face a deficit of $10,-
000,000,000 or $12,000,000,000.
However, we may well antici-
pate new taxes on alcohol, to-
bacco and other mass luxuries
which, with a manufacturers'
excise tax, will go a long way
toward meeting a 1952 deficit.
★
This prospective freedom
from large deficit and borrow-
ing should not be greeted with
loud hosannas and street danc-
ing. For this fiscal picture is
painted upon a lurid back-
ground of inflation.
The fact that inflation in-
creases tax collections is no
reason to view inflation as
anything but a menace. To a
degree, it merely means that
we are spending our past sav-
ings and destroying what is
going to be needed for person-
al security, for industrial re-
habilitation and renewal.
This picture also takes no
account of the vital needs of
economy in nonessential ci-
vilian expenditures.
