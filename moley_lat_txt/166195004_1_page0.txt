WAGES AND
OUTPUT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the package deals with
unions, now embodied in wage
contracts, certain big compa-
nies have granted productiv-
ity increases.
Standing by itself, this kind
of increase seems to be very
reasonable. It means or
should mean that when work-
ers as a body produce more,
they should share in the prof-
its from the increased output.
To the plain man unversed
in labor-management dialectic
and tactics, productivity in-
creases simply apply to a
group of workers the old
piecework principle: the more
you do the more you get.
This, except for the element
of maintaining labor solidari-
ty, always seemed to be the
best way to reward people in
a world of work and win.
But the plain man replies
that when this principle is
applied in some companies and
not in others, there is no labor
solidarity because some work-
ers will get more than others
for the same kind of work.
The union leader then an-
swers, "Let all workers or-
ganize in the same industry
unions and get the increases
everywhere."
Now the government wage
board favors productivity
raises in all future contracts
in every industry. And we are
dealing with facts and not
theories. Provisions for pro-
ductivity increases are in con-
tracts, and they are now
generally decreed by our eco-
nomic stabilizers.
If the plain man may be
permitted another question, as
Senators say in hearings, he
will inquire whether these in-
creases are not directly con-
tradictory to cost-of-living
increases. For increased pro-
ductivity when not accompa-
nied by price increases is one
of the best and soundest ways
to curb inflation.
If there can be enough pro-
duction, there will be no rise
in the cost of living. Would
not productivity increases run
to the same end as cost-of-
living increases? In short, if
wages rise with more produc-
tion, the price of the goods
produced will not be reduced,
living costs will not fall, in-
flation will go on, and wages
will rise still more.
However, for some time
these potential wage increas-
es may not become actual.
They may be merely a way
by which the government is
seeking to avoid another
across-the-board wage increase.
Eric Johnston is reported to
want productivity wage in-
creases confined to genuine
examples of increased produc-
tivity. This is a very naive
suggestion. He ought to know
that increases in productivity
can be determined only by
very meticulous measurements
for which very few manufac-
turers are equipped.
They are determined many
months after they occur. And
then they have to be reduced
to percentages in order to
measure wage increases. By
that time, there may be actual
changes in the rate. And if
the rate moves downward, as
it does in very hot weather
or in flu or common-cold epi-
demics, does the government
expect wages to be reduced?
This idea, like all other eco-
nomic devices, is intended to
provide automatic means of
determining profits and wages.
By the time past facts are
measured, a new set of facts
appears. Life moves faster
than the measurement of life.
