U.S. Public
Puzzled by
Korea War
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
MEMPHIS—During the War
of 1812 it became very com-
mon throughout the country
to call that conflict "Mr. Madi-
son's war." As scattered fight-
ing during three years became
more and more indecisive,
with no great glory for Ameri-
can arms on land, people were
asking what it really was all
about.
Something of the same con-
fused state of public opinion
exists today about the Korean
war, despite our heavy and
deplorable losses. There is a
disposition, as in the former
instance, to call it "the Presi-
dent's war"—in this case, Pres-
ident Truman's war.
On this trip I have spent
two weeks in Texas and Ten-
nessee, talking with newspa-
permen and other informed
people in various cities of
those States. They say that
there is no enthusiasm for the
Korean war among the people.
There is, instead, perplexity
and doubt about the whole
thing.

One evening in the Emerald
Room of the Shamrock Hotel
in Houston a male entertainer
tried a song about the Korean
fighting. One could sense at
once a great chill go over the
crowd. His song failed to reg-
ister. I was told that the next
night he did not repeat it.
Instead of complaining
about the state of public
opinion, Gen. Marshall ought
to find out what has caused
this letdown. It is due to no
lack of patriotism or unwill-
ingness to sacrifice. It is due
to reports in the newspapers
from Washington and Lake
Success about the incredible
confusion of the responsible
group of which Gen. Mar-
shall is a major member.
Perhaps the public doesn't
know because our leaders act
as if they did not know.
Our State and Defense De-
partments will have no part
of a U.N. negotiated peace.
But they will not permit Gen.
MacArthur to carry the war
to a military decision. Nobody
seems to know the distinc-
tion between military and po-
litical decisions, although both
Washington and Tokyo talk a
lot about the distinction.

There is also grave doubt,
even among military men,
about the size, resources and
character of the Communist
opposition in Korea. Either
somebody over there has been
grossly deceived, or we are
not getting information about
what they do know.
Is the war to be concluded
by an armistice that in effect
will be a stalemate? Or is its
conclusion to be tied into a
general settlement of Asiatic
affairs?
Certainly, the pursuit of
peace cannot be carried on by
public statements by both
Gen. MacArthur and our peo-
ple at Lake Success. For Gen.
MacArthur speaks through
public statements, and at
Lake Success there are the
sound effects of radio and
television.
Meanwhile, the casualty list
grows and vast replacements
of men and materials are re-
quired. The public confusion
is quite understandable. The
danger is that this confusion
may turn to genuine apathy
about the entire world and
domestic situation.
