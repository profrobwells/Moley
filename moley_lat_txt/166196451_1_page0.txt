The White House Has
Grown Into a Bureau
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Time was, half a century
ago, when the President trans-
acted his business in his own
residence- the White House
proper. He was assisted by a
secretary whom he brought
with him when he took office,
a few clerks and stenographers
and a couple of trusted and ex-
perienced male secretary-
clerks who served through
many administrations. There
were the military and naval
attaches, who were to be seen
and not heard and who kept
out of political and adminis-
trative affairs.
There was a doctor in a
small office in the basement,
whose chief chore was to keep
the Presidential vocal organs
in shape for oratory and poul-
tice his right hand after re-
ceptions. 'There were the
faithful Secret Service people
on constant guard. There was
a head usher, who knew how
to handle Senators and who
supervised the household
flunkies, cooks and waiters.
That was about all.
In Lincoln's day the Presi-
dent worked in his living
rooms on the second floor.
Then there was some expan-
sion for offices on the Treasury
side of the building. The place
was trim, orderly, simple. The
President operated like a real
head of state, unencumbered
by all the rattle, claptrap, pa-
per shuffling and disorder of a
huge business office.
That, incidentally, is how
the Prime Minister of England
still operates. The visitor from
Washington cannot fail to be
impressed by the spare sim-
plicity of No. 10 Downing
Street, which has been smallish
living quarters and ministerial
headquarters for generations.
The last time I saw it there
were, in addition to the eat-
ing and sleeping quarters, only
a few rooms where imperial
business was transacted. The
Prime Minister had a sort of
study and space for a secre-
tary and a few clerks, a Cab-
inet room and a sort of sit-
ting room overlooking parade
grounds, where private con-
ferences were held. The whole
thing was about as pretentious
as the residence and office of a
fairly prosperous doctor who
does occasional consulting in
his own home.
There was little change at
the White House up to Hoo-
ver's day, except for the build-
ing of the executive offices
out toward the old State, War
and Navy Building. Hoover
had three male secretaries-
one for appointments, one for
the press and one for politi-
cal contacts and Congress. He
also had a sort of literary and
research assistant, called the
administrative assistant to the
President.
After that day of fate, March
4, 1933, there was little change
for a few years. Louie Howe,
the President's secretary, ar-
ranged things and whittled
everything down to Louie
Howe size. The administra-
tive assistant's office was abol-
ished and the other secretaries
were reduced to assistant sec-
retaries.

But after two or three years
things began to burgeon.
Roosevelt had a bad sense of
order and was renowned for
having two people do the work
of one. The Budget Bureau
was moved into the executive
establishment and grew, from
a small staff under Lewis
Douglas to a great bureaucra-
cy of 600. The six so-called
"anonymous" assistants were
added. They became as "an-
onymous" as the Washington
Monument. Gen. Vaughan and
others meddle in many
things. The Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers was added and
now has the appearance of a
large life insurance office. The
Presidential establishment has
become a huge department
with all the complications that
such size involves.
It is small wonder that the
President has so little oppor-
tunity to think and plan and
to make decisions.
But worse than that, it
means that this sprawling
mass of officeholders gets a
tentacle into every concern in
the government for there is
still magic in "a call from the
White House." People note and
respond to such calls and not
always for purposes in the
public interest.
