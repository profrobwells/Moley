A Prophet Forecasts
Truman Will Run Again
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Political prophecies are always subject to revision, but
at the moment this writer ventures the guess that President
Truman will run in 1952.
There are very wise people
who do not agree with that
guess and their reasons merit
consideration.
One of them, a distinguished
retired Democratic statesman,
says that Truman will feel "in
his bones" that he cannot win
if he runs. Truman is a very
proud man, he says, and would
flinch from the prospect of
ending his career in defeat.
This venerable prophet
knew the President well in
the Senate and notes that those
were very happy Truman
years. The pace was more leisurely and the responsibilities
infinitely less onerous. Truman would, according to this
man, want to succeed Sen.
Kem in 1953. And so, he concludes, Truman will not be a
candidate.
★
I can see a number of objections to this line of reasoning. Truman is a very proud
man, but he is also a very
cocky, self-confident person.
He is not likely to be convinced that he cannot win.
His mind believes in miracles,
especially since he has seen
one of them happen. He will
look back at 1948, when there
were few so loyal as to give
him reverence. These chosen
few have been elevated in his
mind as possessing the foresight of seers and wizards.
These people — the people
who were for Truman before
Philadelphia — are close to the
President, still enjoying the
comfortable rewards and perquisites accorded to friends in
need. They have everything to
lose if Truman steps aside.
They can and do shield him
from the true facts of his unpopularity. They no doubt say
to him that public opinion will
change again.
★
They will also play upon his
two dominant loyalties—to his
party and to his friends, "You
must not let us down," they
will say. Like all machine politicians, Truman's abiding bit
of self-praise is that he never
deserted his friends. How can
he run out on these intimates
who have been suffering the
cruel blows of inquisitive Senators and self-righteous reformers? He will vindicate
them, as well as his own judgment in keeping them, at the
ordeal of election.
★
Other matters, which seem
incidental, will weigh in the
calculations of his mind. The
White House will be repaired
and will be resplendent. He initiated the alterations, and he
would like to live there in all
its renovated grandeur. He
loves the perquisites of his
office—the ships and planes
and sealing wax.
A scanty competence all his
life has made him appreciate
the cash emoluments of his
office. As President, he is rich
beyond all his early dreams.
There is Margaret, too,
whose musical career would
probably be more flat than
sharp as the daughter of a
retired statesman. And there
seems to be nothing amiss with
the Truman health.
He is probably not worried
about the failure of his Fair
Deal program. In the past he
has argued more eloquently,
perhaps more effectively, about
what Congress has not done
than about his own legislative
successes.
★
And mark well the impact
of an argument in 1952 that
"He kept us out of war." Suppose the Chinese have had
enough and Korea will be pacified? Then he can claim victory for his military decisions
and for his diplomacy. That,
he will claim, will show him
to be a greater military genius
than the hitherto greatest of
his time—MacArthur. Perhaps a public, weary of war
and war alarms, will decide to
let well enough alone. And
Truman will conclude that
disunity among Republicans
is always to be expected.
All of the foregoing speculation is subject to revision as
the issues of the inscrutable
future unfold. But this is how
it looks now.
