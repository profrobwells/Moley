HUEY LONG
IN BRITAIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a column written from
London during the Parlia-
mentary campaign in Febru-
ary, 1950, I said that if Brit-
ain is ever so unfortunate as
to have a Socio-Communist
dictator, Aneurin Bevan would
be the man.
The recent resignation of
Bevan strengthens this belief.
For a would-be dictator can-
not afford to remain too long
as a loyal member of a ruling
government when that gov-
ernment is attempting by com-
promise to keep its jobs a
little longer and is doomed to
ultimate defeat.
Men like Bevan love to fish
in troubled waters, to wreck
their political household, to go
into opposition and gather
their group for a final coup
when things descend to chaos.

Aneurin (Nye) Bevan, with
whom I spent some hours, is
the most formidable dema-
gogue I have ever met. He
combines the ruthless force of
Huey Long with the Welsh
vocabulary of John L. Lewis.
He regards the hypocritical
Socialism of Attlee and Her-
bert Morrison with imperfect-
ly disguised contempt. They
hate and fear Bevan. This
break has been due for a long
time.
Bevan cannot command
more than a small minority of
the current 300 Labor mem-
bers of Parliament. Nor is
he especially strong with the
trade unions. But in the rou-
tine voting at party confer-
ences, where a large number
of assorted radicals and fel-
low travelers are in regular
attendance, he musters large
votes.
Bevan's wife, Jennie Lee,
and Michael Foote, whom Mrs.
Roosevelt presented to Amer-
ica on television last Sunday,
edit a left-wing Socialist week-
ly which has some influence in
Britain.

While Bevan made a great
outcry about the government's
decision to charge a fee for
dentures and spectacles, his
real attack has been anti-
American. He claims that
Britain can produce plenty of
defense material and also civil-
ian goods, but is unable to do
so because the United States is
monopolizing raw materials,
especially sulphur. Thus, he
claims, we are, despite our
Marshall aid, causing unem-
ployment over there.
This is utter nonsense. It is
a demonstrable fact not only
that the United States is not
denying Britain raw materials,
but also that such shortages as
they have are due to the gross
incompetence of the Labor
government.
★
Bevan's claim is clearly de-
nied in the responsible British
press. The British government
itself has failed to develop pro-
duction of sulphur and sul-
phuric acid in Britain and the
empire. Thus, we are assured
by responsible people in Brit-
ain that we should pay no at-
tention to the Bevan diatribes.
But this break of Bevan may
well be the prelude to a defeat
of the government and anoth-
er election. He claims that he
will vote with his party to
keep it in power. But in this
situation there is great likeli-
hood that some of his follow-
ers may be absent when im-
portant votes are taken. They
are more likely to find illness
or some other reason for fail-
ing to vote.
And it will take only the de-
fection of a dozen or so to
bring about the crisis.
When that happens, an elec-
tion will surely bring the Con-
servative Party back into pow-
er. Then Bevan and his fel-
low radicals may well attempt
to seize leadership in a disor-
ganized Labor Party.
