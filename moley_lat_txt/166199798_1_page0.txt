Price-Freeze Idea Held
Best Bet for Silly Prize
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is a bit early to award a
prize for the most absurd idea
generated by the emergency,
but until a real genius of fol-
ly comes along, Price Admin-
istrator Michael V. DiSalle
heads the nominations.
His idea of a 30-day price
freeze has no chance of adop-
tion, since his immediate su-
perior, Stabilizer Alan Valen-
tine, has indicated disapproval.

The dispute will go to Mo-
bilizer Charles Wilson, and
probably from him to the Pres-
ident. But the serious proposal
of this plan shows how unpre-
pared Washington still is for
a situation it has compre-
hended for many, many
months. As a plan, it is prob-
ably dead. As a symptom, it
is alarming.
First, there was the freeze
of automobile prices at the
Dec. 1 level by Valentine.
Then DiSalle arrived from To-
ledo with nothing but his
Latin temperament and will-
ing hands. For a time, he even
lacked a desk on which to rest
his weary feet. Hastily dis-
claiming before a Congression-
al committee any responsibil-
ity for the Valentine auto-
mobile freeze, he searched
for a new formula and came
up with the 30-day freeze.
★
The plan provided that ev-
eryone would be prohibited
from raising prices for 30
days. If anyone sought an ex-
ception, he should fill in an
application blank, enumerat-
ing his reasons. It was
announced that millions of
forms would be printed and
distributed, for the use of
manufacturers, wholesalers
and retailers.
It goes without saying that
a farmer with hens or turkeys
to sell would not bother with
forms of this sort, even if he
had heard of the order. For
DiSalle lacked even the admin-
istrative means to reach down
into the towns, townships and
small cities and make the plan
known.
The largest enterprises, it
can be granted, could be
reached promptly, and because
such companies are always
more responsive and cautious,
they would seek to comply.
But they would by-pass the
necessity of filing applications
for raises. They would mere-
ly limit their sales to cheaper
merchandise. Higher priced
articles would be sold in black
and gray markets.
This situation would be
somewhat similar to that
which prevailed in 1945, when
price control was rapidly de-
teriorating. At that time, the
frozen prices of manufactur-
ers, when thought to be in-
tolerable, could be appealed.
By 1946, no less than 80,000
manufacturers had secured
"relief." Meanwhile, in most
industries qualities had de-
teriorated, and customers got
less and less for their money.
Black markets flourished.

But at that time there was
an OPA with 68,000 employees
and 90,000 additional "volun-
tary" or part-paid helpers.
There is no such organization
at this time.
And in 1945 the armed
services found it unnecessary
to bother with regulations.
They conducted most of their
business on a "cost plus"
basis, with the possibility of
renegotiation later on to iron
out inequities.
This time, during the period
which will be occupied in
"freezing" Price Administrator
DiSalle's idea and in gestating
some other idea, inflation will
march on,
