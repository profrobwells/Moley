Some of Our Troubles
With Japanese Peace
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is not improbable that,
except for the preoccupation
of the Senate over Asiatic pol-
icy, the war with Japan might
have been summarily ended
by Congress, as was the war
with Germany 30 years ago.
At that time, the intermina-
ble debate over the Versaille
Treaty and the League of Na-
tions finally drove Congress
to the expedient of ending the
state of war by a simple reso-
lution. There are many rea-
sons why that would not be
the best way to restore self-
government in Japan. But end-
less obstacles have been placed
in the way of the treaty that
John Foster Dulles has been
patiently promoting for
months. Most of those ob-
stacles have been created by
the present government of
Great Britain. There is now
a good chance that they are
being overcome.
The claims of the Soviet
government to participate
have been ignored, as they
should be, by both the United
States and Britain. Such So-
viet participation would have
been merely to block and con-
fuse.
But it has been important
to get the participation of the
British not only because of
our relations with them, but
because it is important to
Japan to resume trade with
Southeast Asia.
It is more than likely that
had Ernest Bevin lived and re-
mained Foreign Secretary,
agreement might have been
reached long before this. His
successor, Herbert Morrison,
is neither so friendly to the
United States nor so free to
act for his government.
Morrison is a crafty politi-
cian who has never before
dealt with international prob-
lems. His political life has
been within the Labor Party,
in which he has strong and
determined enemies. In the
current negotiations he has
been overruled by his own
Cabinet on at least one impor-
tant occasion. Thus, Dulles
has had to deal not with a
firm and united government,
but with two factions in the
Labor Party.
The first claims of the Brit-
ish were wholly unacceptable
to the United States. One of
those claims was a harsh re-
striction on the Japanese ship-
ping industry. Another was a
demand for a part of the small
gold reserve of Japan. Another
was a serious limitation of
Japan's textile industry.
Since those terms would
have hopelessly crippled
Japan's efforts to recover, the
United States rejected them.
For if Japan is not to support
herself, we shall have to make
up the deficiency.
Finally, the deadlock was
limited to the question of
which Chinese government
was to participate in the treaty.
Britain favored Red China, and
we favored Nationalist China.
Dulles proposed a compromise
to the effect that neither of
the Chinas should sign the
treaty, but that three years
hence Japan might make a bi-
lateral treaty with one or the
other.
This was accepted by Morri-
son, but his Cabinet turned it
down. And there the deadlock
continued.
Meanwhile, the state of af-
fairs in Japan is in grave dan-
ger of deterioration. The re-
moval of MacArthur was a
great shock to the Japanese
government and people. They
had loyally co-operated with
our occupation forces and
were eagerly looking forward
to a treaty which would seal-
permanent and friendly rela-
tions. The long delays have
given Communist and other
anti-American elements the op-
portunity to create discontent.
Meanwhile, we continue to
bear the expense of aid, just
as we carried the burden of
the war against them.
As time goes on, it is becom-
ing more and more apparent
that it is more difficult to
please our allies than it was to
defeat our enemies.
