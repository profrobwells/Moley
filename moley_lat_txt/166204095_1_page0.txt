RFC, an Agency Which Has
Outlived Its Great Purpose
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Truman's nomina-
tion of the Reconstruction Fi-
nance Corp. directors, three of
whom are seriously criticized
in the Fulbright report, pre-
sents a challenge which the
Senate should meet head on.
It should reconstruct the RFC
with a single head and reject
any nominee for that position
who is not a sound, able, trust-
worthy and nonpolitical man
of experience—in short, another
Jesse Jones.
The amazing story of the
RFC, told by the Fulbright re-
port, carries a very important
moral lesson. It shows how a
fine piece of government ma-
chinery, created for an emer-
gency, can become a nest of
infection if permitted to live
beyond the necessity that gave
it birth. It shows how gov-
ernment aid, however nobly
conceived, ultimately aids only
political purposes.

The RFC was created in
1932, when government credit
was essential to support tot-
tering private business institu-
tions. It was an institution
based upon a great concept.
And it performed a great pub-
lic service.
When Roosevelt was inaugu-
rated in the midst of the bank
crisis, the RFC was an indis-
pensable means of quieting the
storm. Banks that were
deemed sufficiently solvent to
reopen after the holiday were
given RFC loans, which they
covered by the issue of pre-
ferred stock to be held as
collateral.
At that moment, Jesse H.
Jones, a director of the RFC
by appointment of President
Hoover, was made chairman
by President Roosevelt. From
then on, for 11 years, Jones
was literally the RFC and the
RFC was Jones.
No one has ever so enjoyed
the confidence of Congress as
did Jones in those years. When
he became Secretary of Com-
merce, Congress moved the
lending agencies, including the
RFC, into that department, un-
der the custody of Jones.
When Roosevelt ousted
Jones to pay Henry Wallace
for his political services, Con-
gress moved the lending agen-
cies out from the Wallace do-
main.
Jones, of course, had his en-
emies, but no one could ques-
tion his keen business ability,
and no scandals marked his
years in the RFC.

But after the departure of
Jones, the RFC fell into the
hands of bureaucratic and po-
litical hacks. The strong hand
of Jones had diverted or resist-
ed pressure from all sources,
sometimes from the White
House itself.
As long ago as four years
Jones from his retirement gave
warning of what has now hap-
pened. He said then that the
RFC, which was created for
an emergency, should be put
into deep freeze until the next
emergency. Specifically, he
suggested that it should be re-
duced to skeleton size, that it
should stop lending and slowly
liquidate outstanding loans.
His advice was ignored and
the RFC went its foolish way.
Last year Jones spoke again.
He had reached the conclusion
that the RFC should be sunk,
"lock, stock and barrel." Again
he was ignored.
Now it will be claimed that
the RFC is essential in another
emergency. But Congress,
which has the real determina-
tion of what will be done,
should act to protect this insti-
tution from the abuses which
have become so obvious.
