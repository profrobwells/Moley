Triumph for Socialism:
Fewer Rich; More Poor
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The England of old is not
dying. It is just fading away.
The social revolution has
come but not gone. It did not
come slowly and stealthily,
but with the rush of a hurri-
cane.
The British social and eco-
nomic structure had been
shaky for a long time, in-
creasingly so after the famous
victory in the first world war.
But under the impact of the
second war for freedom and
free life of the Socialists it
has collapsed. Perhaps it is
not collapsed, but taken apart,
reshuffled and turned upside
down.

Americans had better take a
good look at their mother
country before they experi-
ence the same kind of trans-
mogrification. If anyone wants
to know what that word
means, let him read on to the
end of this short article. It
will then be clear.
The London Economist has
just published some figures of
incomes, taxes and purchasing
power, which, if arranged
properly, tell a vivid story of
what happens to a country
that tries to get something for
nothing.
The comparisons that fol-
low are of the fiscal years
1938-39 and 1948-49. These pre-
sumably mean the fiscal years
observed in the budgetary ac-
counting of the British gov-
ernment.
Karl Marx could hardly
have wished a more dire fate
for the upper classes than
they have experienced over
that decade. Robespierre was
more merciful.
He simply cut off the heads
of the nobility. The tax blight
has stripped the foliage and
left the naked tree for all to
see. In 1938-39, there were 6590
people who had £6000 or more
left after income tax.
The average tax on those
people was £13,399, and each
had left after tax an average
of £9482. For so small a coun-
try, that represented a sizable
well-to-do class.
But in 1948-49 only 86 peo-
ple were left with £6000 or
more after tax. And the aver-
age tax paid by them was
£138,953. They had left an
average of £7658. That is all
that remains of the 'econom-
ic royalists of Britain.
Perhaps Marx and Lenin
would have wished to keep
this small group alive, just to
warn poorer people never to
try to get rich.
Since these people have
been squeezed dry, Attlee's
welfare state has had to move
downward to get the taxes
to support Utopia—that is, to
support it over and above the
contribution by President
Truman's Marshall Plan.
Expropriation set in among
the middle class. In fact, the
white-collar people might now
be called the frayed and
brownish-collar class. The
average tax paid by people
who had £4000-£6000 left after
tax rose sixfold, and the
number in the group de-
clined more than one-half. In
the £2000-£4000 group, taxes
went up threefold. The num-
ber in the group increased.
In the £1000-£2000 class, taxes
doubled.

In purchasing power, in-
comes from wages before tax-
es rose in the 10 years by 28%.
Incomes from profits, inter-
est and rents declined 20%.
The profits paid out by com-
panies—presumably in divi-
dends—declined 30%. Salaries
have been stationary before
tax, which means that with
increased taxes these people
have a much lower standard
of living.
But the bureaucrats, always
the beneficiaries in Socialism,
have attended to their own
salaries, which have risen
very substantially. High per-
manent officials of the gov-
ernment get about 50% more
than they did in 1938. Social-
ists have not seen fit to ex-
tend their principle of equal-
ity to women in their own
bureaucracy, however, since
women are paid on a sepa-
rate and lower scale.
Bureaucracy does not die,
and neither does it fade away.
