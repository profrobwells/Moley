Only the Congress Can
Settle Tidelands Chaos
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
DALLASâ€”The Korean war
has probably driven from the
minds of people in the inland
States the war between the
Federal government and Tex-
as over the ownership of the
oil-bearing tidelands. But the
subject is certainly not dead
in Texas. As matters now
stand, the great hope of the
State that has such tidelands
interests is in Congress.
*
The Supreme Court in the
cases involving the tidelands
of California, Texas and Loui-
siana has taken the strange
position that, despite many
affirmations over the genera-
tions to the contrary, the Fed-
eral government has a supe-
rior claim. The strange reason-
ing by which a bare majority
of the Supreme Court estab-
lished this Federal claim need
not detain us here. It has
been discussed several times
before in this column.
The hard fact is that practi-
cal considerations now require
that the rights of the States
be re-established. Unless this
is done, unutterable confusion
may result from the multipli-
cation of applications for Fed-
eral leases of land already
largely leased by the States.
*
These applications are based
upon the theory that the pres-
ent Federal law governing the
leasing of public lands should
also govern the leasing of acre-
age under the marginal seas.
In an impressive series of
articles by Allen Duckworth,
of the Dallas Morning News,
this rash of applications is
described and the dangers in-
volved are thoroughly ex-
posed.
It seems that when the suits
by the Federal government to
establish Federal rights in
these marginal lands were
started, it was the intention
of the government to hold
these oil lands as a Federal
reserve, presumably for na-
tional defense purposes. It is
not yet clear that the Depart-
ment of the Interior has aban-
doned this position.
But it may be that the
courts will hold that private
applications for leases must be
honored under the Federal
Leasing Act. In that case, the
Interior Department will have
to act upon these applications.
There would be conflict with
the present leases to large oil
companies by the States which
are yielding handsome re-
turns to the States. Texas
alone has leased 350,000 tide-
land acres for more than
$7,000,000. Under the Federal
law, such leases, according to
the Texas Attorney General,
Price Daniel, would yield only
$87,000.
The Dallas News articles
point out further that, if
leases are granted by the Fed-
eral government to these many
applicants, the result would
be the selling of most of them
to the large companies. Those
companies would be driven to
this course to protect the
leases they already have. This
suggests a large speculative
concern in these small appli-
cations, because it is hardly
possible that most of the ap-
plicants could develop the oil
themselves.
*
In any event, vast confusion
would result, which would
hardly be in the public inter-
est.
The proper way to avoid
this consequence and to stop
this invasion of the property
rights of the States would be
the enactment of a bill now
pending in Congress to quit-
claim the tidelands to the
States. This would override
the present interpretation of
the law by the Supreme
Court. Such a bill was passed
in 1948, but it was vetoed by
President Truman. This time,
it is hoped that such a veto
can be overridden.
While it is difficult to im-
press other States with the
national importance of this
issue, the fact is that this
view of the Supreme Court en-
dangers the property rights
of all the States.
*
For if, in the interests of
national defense and on the
dubious ground that there is
an identity between national
sovereignty and a property
right of the Federal govern-
ment, there is no reason to
expect that such an invasion
will not take place in all
mineral property rights every-
where.
It is probably not generally
realized that the Federal gov-
ernment already owns nearly
24% of the land of the United
States. That should be enough
for all present needs.
