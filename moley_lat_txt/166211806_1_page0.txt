Apparently His Friends
Won't Tell Mr. Acheson
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A part of the amazing ca-
pacity of Dean Acheson to re-
main in office may appear in
his testimony before the Sen-
ate committees, but the major
secret of his tenacity may
never appear in words. It is,
in fact, an unfathomable puzzle
even to those who knew him
well in earlier days, when he
seemed to be a charming, cul-
tured, intelligent but weak
personality.
For many months, perhaps
two years, Acheson has been
the object of attacks in the
press and in Congress as fierce
as any Federal public official
has suffered in our history.
Such a barrage of criticism
is extremely difficult for a
public official to endure, even
when he is backed by a loyal,
stubborn superior. If he hears
and reads only a part of what
is said against him and his
policies he cannot help enter-
taining doubts about himself.
Even the protective isolation
which a high official can claim
must be constricting and bor-
ing to a sensitive mind. If the
mind is sufficiently sensitive,
however, it must be haunted
by the consciousness that be-
yond that protective China
wall of bureaucracy implaca-
ble enemies are on the prowl.
Such a mental and emotional
burden generally becomes un-
bearable.
Very strong men have found
themselves confronted with a
choice between mental and
physical breakdown or resig-
nation and have taken the lat-
ter course. If, as in Acheson's
case, such pilloried and un-
popular officials attempt to re-
main in office their capacity to
make sound judgments be-
comes impaired by the strain
under which they attempt to
work. And things go from bad
to worse.
Roosevelt in such a situation
took the course of a merciful
referee who embraces the
staggering and bewildered
fighter and leads him to his
corner. This course Roosevelt
took by writing a cordial letter
of regretful farewell. Truman
takes no such course.
Acheson's brief but unhappy
career as Undersecretary of
the Treasury was ended, how-
ever, because Roosevelt defi-
nitely felt that he was out of
sympathy with the administra-
tion's policies. Acheson was
unpopular only with the Presi-
dent. It was years before the
break was mended and Ache-
son returned â€” that time to
the State Department.

It is a fair guess that Ache-
son is being encouraged now
by no other than his old
teacher, Justice Frankfurter.
When he first entered the
Treasury his sponsor was un-
doubtedly the then Prof.
Frankfurter, who years earlier
had given him his assignment
as secretary to Justice Bran-
deis. All through his life
Acheson was under the shadow
and tutelage of such positive
individuals as Frankfurter,
Brandeis and the senior mem-
bers of the law firm which he
joined. He was never a posi-
tive individual himself.
When he was in the Treas-
ury he accepted as appointees
a number of younger Frank-
furter lawyers. They were
ousted by Morgenthau when
he succeeded Acheson. Later
a number of such appointees
appeared under Acheson in the
State Department. We know
now how much they had to do
with shaping the Acheson
course.
Now, as Secretary of State,
Acheson is probably supported
by people who keep the facts
of public opinion from him,
who tell him that only Sen.
McCarthy and some editors
and members of Congress are
his enemies and that all will
be well when the future course
of events is revealed. Mean-
while, the nation's destiny is
cared for by a public servant
in whom, to say the least, the
nation has absolutely no confi-
dence.
