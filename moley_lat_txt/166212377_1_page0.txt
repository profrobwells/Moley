THE TAX
MUDDLE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If ever there was presented
in Congress a picture of utter
confusion, it is in current ef-
forts to agree upon a tax pro-
gram. This is not unusual in
the making of tax legislation,
but it is made worse this year
because of the results of ridic-
ulous errors in the estimates
of prospective income by Pres-
ident Truman and Secretary
Snyder.
It is also made worse by
the pressure of groups like
the CIO, by the desperate ef-
forts of Democrats to prop the
prestige of their party after
the Asiatic debate and by
wavering leadership in the
House Ways and Means Com-
mittee.
A television debate between
Messrs. Ruttenberg of the CIO
and O'Connell of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce high-
lighted this confusion.
A comparison between what
Mr. Ruttenberg said and the
recent 12¼% increase voted
by the Ways and Means Com-
mittee shows pretty conclu-
sively that the Democratic
majority of that body followed
the CIO line, rather than the
cold facts of experts in gov-
ernment finance.
*
This is hardly the way to
frame a tax program, because
special interests like the CIO
can be counted upon to exag-
gerate their case in the hope
of getting at least half the
loaf. This time, they seem to
have got all the loaf except
the crust.
In the first place, the com-
mittee seems to have only the
foggiest idea of what tax rev-
enues would be during the
next year from present rates.
The President's January es-
timate of receipts for the year
ending June 30, 1951, was $44,-
500,000,000. Secretary Snyder,
prior to the Truman message,
estimated that with the rates
then prevailing, including the
new excess profits taxes, the
income for fiscal 1951 would
be $45,000,000,000.
On Jan. 1, 1951, in this col-
umn I wrote that such an
estimate was too low by $1,-
000,000,000. This correction
was not difficult to make, be-
cause in every year since 1946
the President and the Treas-
ury have been wrong—and
for the same reason. That
reason is that they do not
take into consideration the ef-
fect upon tax receipts of the
rise in the national income.
Following the same princi-
ple, and after the President
submitted his estimate that
there would be a deficit in
fiscal 1951 of $2,700,000,000, I
wrote in this column on Feb.
7, 1951, that there would be no
deficit.
*
The prospect now, a month
before the end of fiscal 1951,
is that there will be no deficit,
but a very sizable surplus.
Receipts will be more than
$50,000,000,000, instead of the
Snyder estimate of $45,000,-
000,000 or the Truman $44,-
500,000,000.
These estimates, made by
this writer with no elaborate
statistical army such as the
President's Budget Bureau and
Snyder's Treasury Depart-
ment, are based on simple com-
mon sense.
They rest upon the princi-
ple—successfully applied, I
may add, in contradicting the
President in former years—
that when the gross national
product and national income
are rising, tax receipts will
rise at a more rapid rate.
This I learned from an econ-
omist, Dr. Julius Hirsch, and
it has worked successfully
year after year.
Why the President's advis-
ers do not apply this principle
I do not know. Perhaps they
do and, as in the case of mili-
tary advisers, are waved aside
by the imperious will in the
White House.
