Taxing Co-operatives;
a Problem in Politics
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At long last the President
and his Secretary of the Treas-
ury have made a very feeble
suggestion that co-operatives
in business competing with
heavily taxed corporations be
denied the tax exemption privi-
leges that they now enjoy.
it is nard to believe that this
suggestion means anything, be-
cause, as Secretary Snyder ex-
plains it, the proposal would
hardly put those organizations
on a tax parity with private
businesses. And the President
is too obsessed with politics to
offend such powerful groups.
More than once, the Presi-
dent in fishing expeditions for
farm votes has taken the ridic-
ulous position that taxing co-
operatives would destroy
them. And the President, pos-
ing as the farmer's friend, has
asserted that he would never
let that happen.

The President in his tax
message made this very cau-
tious statement: "I urge the
Congress... to review the
tax status of organizations
now exempt under present
law."
Secretary Snyder elaborated
this in his testimony before
the House Ways and Means
Committee as follows: "An-
other type of structural revi-
sion relates to the treatment of
business organizations now ex-
empt from tax, including co-op-
erat√≠ves and other mutual en-
terprises. This committee is
familiar with the difficult and
controversial problems in this
area, having conducted exten-
sive hearings on this subject in
recent years.
"During the last session,
your committee found a solu-
tion for some of these prob-
lems, such as the unrelated
business income of charitable
and educational institutions.
The possibility of taxing the
co-operative and other mutual
enterprises was also then ex-
plored. I would suggest that
this examination be continued
with reference to co-opera-
tives, mutual savings banks,
and building and loan associa-
tions.
"To the extent that collective
buying and selling results in
lower buying prices or larger
incomes to patrons or mem-
bers, these savings enter into
their taxable income as indi-
viduals.
"However, funds which are
not returned to members of
these mutual enterprises are
available tax free for expan-
sion in competition with other
taxable businesses. We should
seek to apply the corporation
income tax to such retained
funds.
"This would not impair the
ability of co-operatives and
mutual saving and credit insti-
tutions to perform their tradi-
tional functions of collective
buying and selling or pooling
of savings for investment."
Snyder is undoubtedly strik-
ing at a very important fea-
ture of the operation of co-
operatives because it is well
known that very large sums
are left with them and not paid
out as patronage dividends.
Those sums still belong to
members who thus avoid add-
ing them to taxable income.
*
This incentive creates an ex-
act opposite situation to that
of a corporation which, if it
withholds money from stock-
holders for reserves or expan-
sion, may fall afoul of Section
102 of the Internal Revenue
Act.
When we come right down
to brass tacks, these so-called
patronage payments, or re-
funds or dividends, are really
dividends paid out of the prof-
its of the business done by the
organization. The business
profits should be taxed, just as
corporation profits are taxed,
and the patronage dividends
should be taxed as they are
now.
With every segment of the
economy laboring to sustain
the great burden of a welfare
state and a war effort, no one
should escape his share of the
load.
