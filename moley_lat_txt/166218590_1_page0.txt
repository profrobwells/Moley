HOW TAFT COULD WIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The biggest roadblock on
Taft's route to the White
House is the conviction of
many Republicans that he
cannot be elected if nomi-
nated.

This belief, eagerly promu-
gated by Democrats and
by northeastern Republican
alike, has had a profound ef-
fect on public sentiment. It is
rooted in the largely un-
founded criticism that was
urged in 1940 and 1948, that
"Taft has no color." Closely
related to this are the sayings
that "Taft has made too many
enemies" and "Taft is too out-
spoken."

*

These pessimistic views
were widely held in Ohio dur-
ing the Senator's 1950 cam-
paign. The stunning victory
on that occasion should be a
rational answer to those ob-
jections, but political senti-
ment is not always rational.
It is based on habit and emo-
tion. And the old anti-Taft
ideas, while scotched, are not
killed.

Taft and his managers can,
if they will, take measures to
overcome these rooted beliefs,
and I shall, for what it may
be worth, suggest a method.
Long observation of and par-
ticipation in campaigns have
convinced me that traditional
campaign methods are out of
date. Something fresh and
new is urgently needed, and
Taft has the qualities to pro-
vide just that.

*

Therefore, if he is nomi-
nated, he should discard the
old mass-meeting oratorical
approach. That method has
always consisted of appear-
ances in key cities in big
halls, with a prepared speech
in manuscript carefully tail-
ored by a flock of experts and
speech writers. These utter-
ances no longer seriously im-
press hearers because the pub-
lic is too sophisticated to ac-
cept them. They give no meas-
ure of the speaker, and they
usually fail to answer the
questions that people want
answered.

Taft is not good with a
manuscript, and his written
speeches are solid but not
moving. He is, however, mag-
nificent in free-for-all debate
and in answering questions.
He should make his cam-
paign a series of question-
and-answer periods, using tele-
vision and radio wherever he
can to get his personality over.
A few years ago at the big
newspaper publishers' dinner
in New York Taft, instead of
giving a speech, held a glori-
fied press conference. One edi-
tor, Nat Howard of the Cleve-
land News, asked questions at
one microphone, and Taft,
completely "off the cuff," an-
swered them at another micro-
Sen. Taft
phone. I felt that night that
he made a tremendous hit.
Since then, he has made sev-
eral speeches to many of the same
people, and the impression
was not so good.

*

My suggestion is that in his
major appearances in next
year's campaigning Taft
should arrange to have three
or four editors or newspaper
men sit at one table and fire
questions. Taft, standing at
the lectern, should answer
them. The questioners should
be local people selected with-
out regard to party. The ques-
tions should not be known
to Taft beforehand.

Thus, Taft would tour the
country taking on all comers.
No other man suggested for
the Presidency could afford
to take this test. Taft alone
has the knowledge to take it.
Of course, he would say
some things that some people
might not like. But the over-
all impression would be that
of a man of supreme courage,
superb capacity, and unrivaled
knowledge of public affairs.
Such a performance would
provide for politics something
fresh, new, and inspiring. It
would, I believe, sweep the
country.
