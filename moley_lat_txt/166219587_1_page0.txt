RIFLE, Colo.—While great
international tensions prevail
over supplies of oil in the
Middle East and elsewhere,
the Federal government is
quietly proceeding with an
enterprise which may in years
to come protect this country
from the danger of losing for-
eign supplies or of the ex-
haustion of our present petro-
leum deposits.
The Bureau of Mines of the
Department of the Interior has
been developing an oil shale
demonstration mine and plant
in the mountains near Rifle,
which is located in Western
Colorado, less than 100 miles
from the Utah border.
The ultimate possibilities of
oil from shale are almost be-
yond belief, although enthusi-
asm concerning the immediate
results of this demonstration
must be restrained. Oil-produc-
ing shale extends over an area
of thousands of square miles
in Western Colorado, Eastern
Utah, and Southern Wyoming.
Apparently the richest of
this deposit is in this section
of Colorado. It is estimated
by the government that the
best of this Colorado shale
would produce 100,000,000,000
barrels of oil. Ultimately, when
the problems of economical
production are conquered,
there could be produced from
this shale and less rich de-
posits in Utah and Wyoming
300,000,000,000 barrels.
★
Some notion of the impor-
tance of this can be conveyed
by pointing out that 100,000,-
000,000 barrels of oil is more
than has ever been produced
in the United States from pe-
troleum and is several times
the proved petroleum reserves
now remaining in the ground.
According to this estimate,
It will be a long, long time be-
fore we need to begin worry-
ing about running out of oil
because of our own extrava-
gance, Communist Imperial-
ism, or anything else.
Strictly speaking, there is
no oil in shale, although thin
pieces can be ignited with a
match. It contains a substance
called kreogen. This stuff
under the influence of intense
heat undergoes a chemical
change which produces a thick
oil. That oil can then be re-
fined and made into the ordi-
nary oil products.
People have known about
the possibility of producing oil
from shale for centuries. Be-
fore oil was produced in Penn-
sylvania nearly a century ago,
the Mormons produced oil
from shale. The development
of the product has been set
back in the years since by
successive discoveries of new
oil fields.
This present plant was set
up six years ago because the
second world war revealed a
danger of shortages. About 300
workers operate the under-
ground mines, the crushing
and reducing plants, and the
oil refinery.
The government is making
no pretension to the develop-
ment of oil itself. It is merely
demonstrating and pre-
sumably, when economical pro-
duction is assured, the major
oil companies will develop the
very large holdings of shale
that they have in the region.
From the rather complicated
cost figures of the government,
this writer derives the conclu-
sion that the cost of produc-
tion per gallon is going down,
and when the cost of petro-
leum rises high enough to
meet it, there will be a new
and great industry in this re-
gion.
When that will be no one
can estimate accurately. But
the possibility is here, and it
is reassuring.
