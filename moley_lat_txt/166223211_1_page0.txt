EISENHOWER
RUMORS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A year hence we shall
know the names of the two
people between whom we shall
make a selection for the next
President. Perhaps the wisest
thing we could do would be to
wait those 12 months before
we attempt to guess the names
of those two more-or-less for-
tunate men.
We shall not follow that
wise course, however, but
spend endless and wasted
hours in speculating about
who they will be. And the
most active guessing for sev-
eral months will center on the
name Elsenhower.
He is in Europe now, but
the Atlantic is a small barrier
to the flow of rumors these
days. We shall hear constantly
from travelers and by other
means of communication
many versions of what the
general intends to do. Each of
those versions, we shall be
assured, will be based on "in-
side stuff." In fact, dozens of
self-appointed Eisenhower
spokesmen will be offering
various views of what will
happen. I offer two here as
samples.

★

A very recent version is that
Eisenhower is quite discour-
aged at the progress of Euro-
pean rearmament. He believes
that Europeans are dragging
their feet. He is not only out
of sympathy with Truman's
domestic policies, which he re-
gards as socialistic, but with
the Truman foreign policy as
well.
He feels, according to this
version, that unless Turkey,
Greece and other South Euro-
pean fighting nations are add-
ed to the Atlantic alliance
there can be no defense
against Russia. Further, this
report says that the general
will return in a few months
and take a strong stand
against the administration's
policies, domestic and foreign.
Most of this report makes
no sense at all. Since Eisen-
hower has committed him-
self to the proposition that
Europe can be defended, he
can hardly return, confess
failure, and repudiate the Tru-
man-Acheson policies in
Europe.

★

Another version, quite con-
trary to this, is that he fa-
vors the Truman foreign pol-
icy and is so opposed to the
critics of that policy that if
Taft should be nominated by
the Republicans he will accept
a Democratic nomination.
This point of view is being
propagated by people who are
favorable to the Truman-
Acheson policies, who bitterly
oppose Taft, but who are
afraid Truman cannot win.
Hence, they want to make cer-
tain that the Democratic Par-
ty stays in power.
To believe this, we would
have to brush aside many
weighty considerations. One
is that Eisenhower would be
willing to act as a receiver for
a foreign policy that has lost
so heavily in public favor. An-
other is that he would permit
his name to be used to over-
throw the man whom he desig-
nates as his Commander in
Chief. A third is the practical
fact that in the two weeks be-
tween the conventions even
Eisenhower could not snatch
the nomination away from the
Truman machine.

★

Common sense, undisturbed
by any inside information,
would seem to point to a few
simple conclusions. Eisen-
hower cannot and probably
would not disown the long
succession of decisions upon
which the Truman-Acheson
policy is based, for the simple
reason that the general had a
part in those decisions in and
after the war.
If he were nominated, he
would admit some mistakes
but support the general line of
administration policy. On do-
mestic issues he would ex-
press conservative views in
generalities but hardly attack
specific Truman policies with
any vigor.
He is a master of diplomatic
language, and a safe middle
course would be his line. We
cannot be sure, however, that
he is prepared to fight for the
Republican nomination, and
unless he does he will prob-
ably not get it.
