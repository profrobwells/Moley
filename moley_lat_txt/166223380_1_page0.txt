It is to be hoped that no one
will question its propriety if
the writer of this column ventures
the claim: "I told you
so." In a column published in
this and other newspapers on
approximately Jan. 24 this
year, the statement was made
flatly that President Truman's
budget estimates of income
from present tax rates were
very wrong indeed.
It was also said that his
demands for higher taxes were
completely out of line with
prospective needs. Secretary
Snyder has now admitted the
error, which is a charitable
way of describing a gross mis-
representation.
The Truman budget predicted
a deficit for fiscal 1951
of $5,500,000,000. In the column
to which I refer above, this
answer was made: "Instead of
Truman's predicted deficit for
fiscal 1951, there will be a
fairly sizable surplus with no
new taxes." Secretary Snyder
now says that, instead of a deficit,
there will be a surplus of
$1,000,000,000. This brightened
outlook, he says, is due "to
higher receipts than expected
from individual and corporate
income taxes." That is exactly
what should have been anticipated
in January.
The same sort of error will
prevail in the estimates for
fiscal 1952, and the Treasury
admits this also. The President
estimated receipts for fiscal
1952 at $55,100,000,000 and expenditures
at $71,600,000,000,
leaving a deficit of $16,500,000,-
000. For that huge deficit the
President demanded higher
tax rates and new taxes. In
January my column said:
"Even without real economy, a
fiscal 1952 deficit would be
around $5,000,000,000."
Secretary Snyder has now
admitted that $10,000,000,000
from new or increased tax
rates will be enough to provide
for this year. In short, the anticipated
fiscal 1952 deficit will be lower
by $6,500,000,000. Even
$10,000,000,000 in additional
taxes is far too high unless
something really unexpected
happens.
It should be emphasized,
moreover, that these great differences
between facts and estimates
are due to no important
cuts in requests for appropriations.
If Congress will use an ax
on nonmilitary items, there
will be no need for new taxes
at all and no deficit. We shall
see what happens in that department.
This failure to estimate receipts
correctly has prevailed ever
since Messrs. Truman and Snyder
have been in office. It is hard
to see why it should persist.
Surely, the plain arithmetic
should be comprehended by this
time. For when incomes are rising
and employment and general
business conditions are at a high
rate, income from taxes rises
at a higher rate than the rate
of increase in the national income.
That is because incomes
move into higher brackets.
Other factors are involved, but
this is the most important.
The conclusion must be drawn
that the President proceeds
on a policy of striking for higher
taxes whenever an emergency
seems to provide a suitable
excuse. He has been unwilling
to apply real restraints on
inflation and, in fact, has followed
policies definitely designed to
accelerate inflation.
And because higher tax rates
may well survive the present
emergency, the way can be prepared
for great expansion of welfare
projects the moment the slightest
sag comes in employment and
business activity. Thus, a political
end is served by keeping the
anticipated income low and by
demanding more taxes. It is an
end which should be made known
to the public. For the public
pays the taxes.
