The Egg and Mr. Attlee;
a Blunder in Socialism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It would be a strange and
ignominious end if His Maj-
esty's Socialist government of
Great Britain were to fall be-
cause of a question of chicken
feed. I don't mean small
change, but the real food eat-
en by poultry.
The lack of that agricultural
article has often been fatal to
a setting hen, but never in
history has it been fatal to a
sitting government. Perhaps,
despite his keen sense of
humor, Churchill's burning re-
gard for imperial dignity will
stay the blow. Judging from
the preliminaries, the Social-
ists may be saved this deplora-
ble humiliation. But the facts
once more reveal the folly of
Socialist "planning."
It seems that after planning
and undertaking the ridiculous
and wasteful peanut scheme,
the Labor government discov-
ered that eggs came from
chickens and that a large sup-
ply might aid their efforts to
keep the British people happy
under Socialism.
So there was set up a colo-
nial development corporation
to operate a poultry farm in
Gambia, which is a small Brit-
ish colony on the west coast
of Africa. The scheme was
launched in 1948 with an ini-
tial capital of £500,000. As in
most other Socialist schemes,
it was found a year later that
more money was needed, and
£310,000 additional was pro-
vided. Then, in 1950, there
was a further shortage of cash,
and £100,000 more was sup-
plied. Up to date, according
to James Griffiths, Secretary
of State for the Colonies, £825,-
000 has gone into the devel-
opment. At the present value
of the pound, this is $2,310,000.
Griffiths says that 38,620
eggs (not dozens) and 51,617
pounds of dressed poultry
have been exported to Brit-
ain. Today in the New York
city market, where my family
buys food, those eggs and that
poultry would bring $27,639.
This is a price inflated by all
the conditions prevailing in
the United States. It is a re-
tail price. And these New
York eggs are nice big ones,
and the chickens are good, edi-
ble fowls. The Gambia eggs,
it is reported, are small and
the hens are skinny.
The planning and operations
of the whole scheme would
have provided Gilbert and Sul-
livan with hilarious comedy
material. Griffiths, prior to
this great experiment, had
probably never seen an egg
except at breakfast. He was
a coal miner who became a
trade union official. The first
manager of the project was an
American named Phillips who
was brought over from Ber-
muda.
He was completely out of
sympathy with African ways
and has been fired. His suc-
cessor has never had experi-
ence in chicken farming and
confided to a reporter that he
"hates chickens."
Gambia has never raised
enough to feed itself, and
food has had to be imported
in exchange for peanuts. The
hot, steaming climate was the
worst in the world for poultry
farming. A poultry pest set in,
and last year flocks of Rhode
Island Reds died of typhoid.
Hence, the necessity to get a
veterinary certificate for the
survivors. Rats had a great
feast.
The "planners" apparently
forgot to provide sufficient
cold storage facilities, and a
great deal of the product
spoiled.
The cream of the jest was
the failure of the "planners"
to realize that they couldn't
raise enough feed for the poul-
try. They proceeded bravely
with bulldozers to clear 10,000
acres of bush land to raise
feed, but only half has been
cultivated.
The natives who have been
hired have been taken from
their customary vocation of
raising peanuts for food, and
they now have to be fed with
imported food.
Griffiths, confronted with
an angry demand in Parlia-
ment by Anthony Eden, admit-
ted failure. No more chickens
and eggs will come to Britain
from Gambia. They will be
needed to feed the natives—
and the rats. Thus there ends
a real Operation Rathole.
Eden promises a genuine de-
bate on the project later.
