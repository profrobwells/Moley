According to Henderson
We're Facing Deflation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In 1942 when price controls
were being imposed, we were
hearing a great deal from Leon
Henderson, who was then the
boss of the Office of Price Administration.
As most of us will remember, Henderson was a master
of pompous economic jargon.
Among the many impressive
expressions which he used to
move Congress and ourselves
was "inflationary gap." This
was supposed to represent the
yawning pit into which we
would fall if we did not submit
meekly to his program of
price controls.
*
In simple terms, that inflationary gap was the amount
of purchasing power that
would remain after all the
value of available goods, all
the taxes, and all the savings
had been subtracted from all
the money income of all of
us.
This surplus would go toward bidding up prices and
thus would be the total inflationary pressure with which
government controls would
have to deal. Henderson figured that for the fiscal year
ending in June, 1943, there
would be a big gap of $18,000,000,000, which was, if true,
very frightening indeed. So
we submitted to the wild ministrations of the OPA.
The people who are now attempting to put over controls
by frightening us, Messrs.
Eric Johnston and Michael Di-
Salle, are not so adept at the
use of economic jargon as was
Henderson. But the fate that
they say we shall meet is the
same.
Since it would seem to clarify matters to compare our
problem in 1951 with that of
1942, I have asked a man who
was a major economic assistant to Henderson to figure out
the present situation by the
Henderson inflationary gap
method and to compare it with
the problem of nine years ago.
The results show that a vast
difference exists between the
two years.
*
According to these figures,
the prospects for total net
production in fiscal 1943 were
$115,000,000,000. For fiscal 1952
they are $310,000,000,000. When
we deduct budget expenditures
from these figures, the result
is $60,000,000,000 for 1943 and
$242,000,000,000 for 1952.
Then, if we deduct the
amount of civilian commodities available from what the
population will receive in income, the figures are $55,000,000,000 for fiscal 1943 and $68,000,000,000 for fiscal 1952.
To get the Henderson inflationary gap, we must subtract
from those figures the taxes
to be paid and the savings
kept by the public. The final
result is that for fiscal 1943
the prospective inflationary
gap was $18,000,000,000, and
for 1952 it would be minus
$8,000,000,000. Thus, according
to the Henderson formula,
there would be a big inflationary pressure in 1943 and
there will be a considerable
deflationary pressure in 1952.
Before we accept these figures as conclusive, we shall
have to take into consideration
several new conditions. But
even after these are calculated,
the inflationary gap for the
year we are now entering
would be less than $5,000,000,000, as compared with the
$18,000,000,000 for 1943.
The gap can be closed by
any one of several methods.
One would be by additional
taxes. But before we impose
those taxes, let us consider
the other alternatives.
One would be increased savings by the people. The other
would be a cut in the government budget of $5,000,000,000. That could easily be done
by Congress without touching
the expenditures for military
purposes.
If the Truman administration wants to prevent inflation, it ought to try this method before it demands a set of
controls which will not only
be ineffective but will aggravate the very problem which
it is trying to solve.
