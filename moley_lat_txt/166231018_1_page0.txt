CANADIAN
SEAWAY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Defense Mobilizer Wilson
and Gen. Marshall have now
followed President Truman
in approving the construction
of the long-debated St. Law-
rence seaway and power
project.
The subject has been before
the country now for almost a
generation. It is still unfin-
ished business in Congress.
Over the years, various argu-
ments have been advanced for
it. In the 1920s, it was urged
as a means of helping the im-
poverished Midwest farmers
who needed cheap transporta-
tion in their competition with
Canadian wheat. In the 1930s
the issue was cheaper power.
Then, as war approached,
national defense became the
chief argument, but when war
came the project was aban-
doned because of the shortage
of materials and manpower.
There is little to be added
to the old arguments pro and
con now, except the objection
to the spending of so much
money for a project that will
require some time before its
completion. The cost as now
estimated on the entire proj-
ect, from Duluth to Montreal,
would be $818,000,000, of
which the United States
would contribute $567,000,000
and Canada $251,000,000.
In addition to the argument
that the seaway is necessary
to carry ore to the steel indus-
try around the Great Lakes,
several other points are made
by its supporters. By 1960,
they claim, there will be a
need for four times the pres-
ent supply of power in the St.
Lawrence region. They also
say that cargo of all kinds
could be shipped cheaply from
lake ports to the sea.
In opposition, it is claimed
that vast resources of lower-
grade iron ore are still in the
Lake Superior region; that as
far as defense is concerned,
the seaway would be highly
vulnerable to enemy attack;
that additional power can be
developed more cheaply from
steam plants; that the St. Law-
rence route would be less effi-
cient than the use of direct
railway transportation to the
Atlantic ports, and that the
cost would be a heavy burden
upon already excessive spend-
ing.
It has been suggested that
the whole controversy could
be ended and the benefits at-
tained by permitting or induc-
ing Canada to build and op-
erate the project, with or with-
out a loan from the United
States. There would be several
advantages in this solution.
It is a sad commentary on
our own government, but nev-
ertheless a true one, that the
Canadian government could
build the project at less cost
and with less danger of polit-
ical manipulation.
After the project is finished,
American interests would use
it and pay for its use.
A primary advantage to
Canada in this arrangement
would be its effect upon the
balance of trade between the
two countries and upon the
mutual stabilization of their
respective currencies.
In short, Canada would have
more to sell to us. There would
be not only vast quantities of
iron ore, but charges for use
of the waterway, and the sale
of power would bring in many
millions of American dollars.
