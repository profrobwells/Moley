NEEDY AID
IN IDAHO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
SALT LAKE CITY—It has
been encouraging, during this
visit to the two somewhat
kindred States of Idaho and
Utah, to note in both the
contrast between Federal extravagance and State economy.
The story of what has been
going on in these States under
two strong, economy-minded
Governors should be noted by
every member of Congress who
is concerned with the growing
burden of government costs.
For if these States can resist
the pressure of minorities and
check spending the Federal
government can do something
along that line.
Before coming to the fight
for economy that Gov. J.
Bracken Lee has made in
Utah, I should like to describe
what Idaho has done about
public assistance, notably
assistance to the elderly. In
this year’s legislative session
two very important laws were
passed on this subject and
approved by Idaho’s new
Governor, Len Lordan. The
intent and effect of these were
explained to me by Atty. Gen.
Robert E. Smylie.
*
In common with other
Western States, Idaho has
been subjected to the pressure
of groups intent on more and
more old-age assistance. Increased
living costs resulted this year
in the largest appropriation for
public assistance in the history
of the State.
It was apparent that something
must be done to keep these
expenses within the resources
of the State and at the same
time to meet legitimate needs.
For 10 years Idaho has had
what is commonly known as a
means test as a preliminary
to public assistance. The law
provides that assistance shall
be given only to persons and
families “who do not have income
and available resources to
provide a reasonable standard
of well-being.”
Despite the clear intent of
the law, however, it became
evident that a great many
people were getting public
assistance who might have
secured help either from their
own resources or from relatives
who had a moral duty to help.
★
The new legislation passed
this year is intended not only
to make certain that people
receiving assistance are genuinely
in need, but to stimulate
children of prospective beneficiaries
to contribute to the support
of their parents. First, the new
legislation strengthened the
legal prohibition against prospective
beneficiaries disposing of property
for the purpose of making
themselves eligible for State aid.
Second, the law now makes
it possible for the State to
recover from the estates of
people who have received assistance
under fraudulent circumstances.
These provisions are intended
to stop the practices, which are
altogether too common, by which
persons get State aid despite
the fact that they can help to
support themselves. In some
cases they have disposed of
property to relatives and in
others have hidden away sums
of money which have been discovered
after death.
★
More important still is the
new Idaho “lien law.” This law
is directed at people who could
qualify for assistance despite
their possession of property
such as real estate. Such people
might have, for example, a farm
worth a few thousand dollars,
but nevertheless no cash for the
current cost of living.
Under the lien law the individual
receiving assistance does not
sign his property over to the
State. What he does is to agree,
when he receives the assistance,
to reimburse the State and to
pledge his real property as security
for such reimbursement. This
agreement has the force and
effect of a lien.
★
In the course of our drift into
the welfare state it has been
ardently argued that no means
test should govern public assistance.
The stock argument has been
that a means test is humiliating
and degrading.
Hence, we have drifted dangerously
near the point of accepting as
a principle the idea that people
have a right to assistance whether
they need it or not.
We have almost reached the
point of regarding the word
“charity” as unmentionable and
degrading, despite Biblical
comments to the contrary.
But there is a limit to the
public purse, and there are obligations
that children should observe,
even at the command of law.
Idaho has courageously faced
this reality.
