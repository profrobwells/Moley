Senator Fabricates His
Figures for Tax Stand
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the current Senate debate on the tax bill, Sen. Hubert Humphrey as might be expected has been the leading exponent of simon-pure Fair Deal theory. Hence, he made a great deal of the dollar savings of the American people this year and by a devious process of statistical argument drew three conclusions: First, that those savings are very great; second, that they go to the higher incomes, and, third, that the higher incomes can bear the brunt of new tax levies,
In so doing, he was running squarely against the contention of Sen. George, the sponsor of the bill, who says that the higher incomes cannot yield the amounts needed and that new sources must be tapped. The true figures and all the dictates of common sense support George. One way to prove this is to take a look at the Humphrey figures and his assumptions based on them.

Humphrey cites a Federal Reserve report that in the first six months of this year savings were accumulating at the rate of $21,000,000,000 a year. Then the Senator draws the conclusion, wholly out of the rarefied air in which the Senator lives, that those savings are primarily in the group earning more than $5000 a year. He "surmises" that. He does not know it. And it is quite probable that most of those savings were in the incomes below $5000.
He draws another conclusion which is not warranted. The Federal Reserve Board did not say that $21,000,000,000 would be saved this year. It said that "for the three-month period ending on July 1 savings were at the rate of $21,000,000,000 a year." That is, the savings in the second quarter were multiplied by four to get the $21,000,000,000. But savings vary from quarter to quarter. In the first quarter of this year savings were, according to the Department of Commerce, only at the rate of $9,300,000,000. Hence, this year's savings will not be the figure stated but considerably less.
The actual savings, according to these government figures, in the first half of this year were $7,600,000,000. But before we take even this as a source of taxes, several factors must be considered. First, how much debt has been piled up? This is a legitimate offset. And, what is more important, what are the savings worth?

The total savings on Jan. 1, 1951, were, according to the National Industrial Conference Board, $226,500,000,000. These were in the form of life insurance, time and other bank deposits, U.S. Savings Bonds, savings and loan association assets, and government pension funds. Inflation, as shown in Labor Department figures, sheared away a value of $9,000,000,000 from these savings from Jan. 1 to July 1. Hence, the $7,600,000,000 was wiped out and savers were actually $1,400,000,000 poorer than they were six months before.
If the predictions of more inflation made by the President come true, we shall be still poorer next January and poorer yet six months later. This is sufficient to show the shoddy nature of Fair Deal figures, especially when presented by such exponents of the alleged common man as Hubert Humphrey. He mixes inaccurate figures with misrepresentation, innuendo and surmise and always comes up with the same fake conclusion: The rich can pay and the poor can have a free ride. The fact is that nobody is getting a free ride except the demagogues,
