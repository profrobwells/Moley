Senators Didn't Need
Bradley's Explanation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The time comes in every
political campaign, in every
lawsuit, in every speech and
in every other test where a
case is to be made, when the
winning contender needs to
pause, to omit overemphasis,
and to avoid losing, tiring and
alienating supporters.
That should be appreciated
by Republican Senators who
are conducting this investiga-
tion in foreign policy. And it
applies specifically to the ef-
fort to compel Gen. Bradley to
reveal what passed between
him and President Truman on
the day the fateful MacAr-
thur decision was made.
Sen. Hickenlooper showed
much more political wisdom
than did Sen. Wiley, in sug-
gesting that the matter be
dropped. For the inference was
so clear and so favorable to
the anti-Truman side that
further evidence was hardly
necessary.
Under questioning Bradley
made it clear that neither he
nor other members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff had made
any suggestion or, in fact, had
any idea about removing Mac-
Arthur. Then a mysterious
communication came to Brad-
ley that the removal was
either decided upon or serious-
ly considered. Then the Joint
Chiefs met for a short time
and discussed the subject.
Then there was a meeting of
Truman, Marshall, Acheson,
Harriman and Bradley, and
the decision was made. What
passed there, Bradley refuses
to divulge.
What apparently happened
was that Bradley and the Joint
Chiefs, until April 5, had no
idea that MacArthur had done
anything to justify their con-
cern. Bradley then learned
that the President was consid-
ering the removal because of
something MacArthur had
done. That was apparently the
letter to Rep. Martin.
Then Bradley talked it over
with the Joint Chiefs, apparent-
ly to find out if they would
agree and to decide upon a
method of taking care of the
military situation at the mo-
ment of removal. Then Brad-
ley apparently reported to the
political people â€” Truman,
Marshall, Acheson and Harri-
man.
Most probably, he was not
asked, but told that the deci-
sion had been made. In short,
Truman made the decision and
everybody else fell in line, in-
cluding Bradley and the Joint
Chiefs. That, it would seem,
is all that needs to be known
in fixing responsibility. The
subservience of the military
is quite clear. To press Brad-
ley further should be unneces-
sary.
The next step is to dig to
the bottom of the political de-
cision by questioning Acheson.
For Marshall's testimony was
so fuzzy and incomplete that
the operation of the political
masterminds is still not very
clear.
It would be politically un-
wise and unfair for the Re-
publican Senators to cast
doubt upon Sen. Russell.
Throughout these difficult
hearings he has handled
things very well indeed. To
question that is to lose some
of the public support that the
Senatorial friends of MacAr-
thur have already unquestion-
ably gained.
At the real core and center
of the deplorable course of
events that has brought us to
this situation have been the
impetuous caprice of the Pres-
ident and the calculated pol-
icies of Acheson. The case can
substantially be made now,
but Acheson's testimony is
still relevant.
From now on, the removal
of MacArthur is less relevant
as an issue. The public wants
to know why our foreign pol-
icy has been so disastrous. Re-
publican Senators have done
well in bringing this out. They
should not get off that clear
course.
