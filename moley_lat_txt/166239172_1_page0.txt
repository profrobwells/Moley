POLITICAL
TAXATION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the same week in which
the House Ways and Means
Committee approved, by a
strict party vote, the 12%%
tax increase, there appeared
the results of a sound and en-
lightening study of income by
the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research.
The bearing of the one upon
the other is very important.
A comparison shows how far
the Congressional supporters
of the Truman regime have
gone in seeking to win votes
by baiting the hook for the
lower income brackets.
The bill approved by the
Ways and Means Committee
proposes to raise the major
portion of $3,000,000,000 by
loading the main part of the
new burden upon higher in-
comes. At the same time it
proposes a stiff rise in excess
profits rates. This is a further
penalty upon new, growing
enterprises.
The National Bureau of
Economic Research study of
income has been under way
for years. It has been directed
by Prof. Simon Kuznets of
the University of Pennsylva-
nia. The summary of his latest
findings is given by Prof.
Arthur F. Burns of Columbia
University. The work of both
of these respected economists
is directly solely toward a
scientific presentation of eco-
nomic facts.
According to the Kuznets
study, in 1929 the highest 5%
of income recipients had 34%
of the total "disposable" in-
come of all individuals in the
United States. This means all
personal income, including
capital gains, left after Fed-
eral income-tax payments, but
before tax on capital gains and
before State and local levies.
By 1939 this 34% had declined
to 27%. By 1946 it had gone
down to 18%.
If we turn to the "rich" or
top 1%, the result is more
striking. In 1929, this group re-
tained 19.1% of all disposable
income. In 1946, it retained
only 7.7%.
Thus, the 5% group traveled
downward approximately half
the way toward the ideal of
statists—equal income for all
—and the top 1% fell two-
thirds of the way.
Dr. Burns correctly says that
this constitutes "one of the
great social revolutions of his-
tory." "Share-the-wealth" Huey
Long and his imitators,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Harry Hopkins, sitting to-
gether in the statesmen's val-
halla, can clink celestial
glasses in a self-congratulatory
toast.
The stern lesson of all this
would not concern them now.
Nor did it concern them in
their days on earth, when they
were getting votes by taxing
and spending.
★
But the lesson is pointed
up by Dr. Burns. He says:
"If we are to look forward
constructively to a material
reduction of income inequali-
ties in the future, we must
seek to attain it principally
by raising the productivity
of those at the bottom of the
income scale rather than by
transferring income from the
rich to the poor. There
can be no doubt that as high
incomes are cut, a point must
come when private investors
have neither the will nor the
power to launch major innova-
tions. Substantial further re-
distribution of incomes may
therefore affect adversely the
size of the national income,
while it cannot improve ap-
preciably the living conditions
of the great masses. The para-
mount source of the rising
living standards of our work-
ers and farmers has always
been an increasing volume of
production, and in the years
ahead it bids fair to become
the only source."
These words should be
noted by the Congressmen who
have written this bad tax bill.
They will not note them. But
they should be noted by the
people who are supposed to
be attracted by this effort to
proceed further with the level-
ing out of incomes.
