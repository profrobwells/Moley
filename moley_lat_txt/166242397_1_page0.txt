The President's Job May
Be Too Big for One Man
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has long been evident
that the job of running the
great Federal government is
too much for President Tru-
man. Recent events are be-
ginning to indicate that the
job may be getting too big
for any President,
Truman's assertion that the
press will have to censor se-
curity information is a con-
fession that the Federal ad-
ministration cannot itself pro-
tect its secrets. The range of
its interests is too wide. If
its concerns were limited to
diplomacy and military affairs
alone, the task would be light-
er. But since the tentacles of
government run into every
cranny of our national life
and government agencies
know more than they can
keep to themselves, the situa-
tion gets completely out of
hand.
Another aspect of the situa-
tion in Washington needs to
be considered. The people who
staff the vast publicity ma-
chines of many departments
are dependent for their jobs
on competing among them-
selves for the favor of seg-
ments of the press. They want
to place stories favorable to
their departments in the very
newspapers and "slick maga-
zines" that the President de-
nounces on every occasion.
One bureau that need not
he named here planted glow-
ing stories of its activities
during the last three months
in the same "slick" magazines
that the President apparently
reads, because he is always
complaining about them.
These stories were, inciden-
tally, gross exaggerations of
the work of the bureau and
were accepted by newsmen
and editors who were too lazy
to get the other side or too
ignorant of things outside
Washington to doubt the hand-
outs.
The benefit to the bureau
was very considerable. First,
Truman, their big boss, saw
the stories. Next, the public
was reached. Does anyone
suspect that this favor to the
bureau will not be repaid in
secret or exclusive informa-
tion?
The press is competitive, as
it should be. Freedom depends
on this competition. If the
press, should combine and
channel its information
through a press-created cen-
sorship it would lay itself open
to the charge of monopoly.
The President would probably
direct his Attorney General to
proceed against such a monop-
oly.
The President himself is no
model of news dispensing.
When he said that his govern-
ment had learned of the latest
Russian atomic explosions dur-
ing the preceding 10 days, he
was giving the Soviet intelli-
gence a valuable lead to how
the information escaped.
The newspapermen covering
the White House, moreover,
have learned that they should
never accept what the Presi-
dent says until they get a
later "clarification" — which
means correction — from the
White House press secretary.
Doubt has accumulated ever
since early Roosevelt years
that the President's press con-
ferences are worth while. Cer-
tainly not to the Presidents,
for Roosevelt revealed himself
usually as a charming master
of verbal confections but a
foggy and unreliable purveyor
of facts. And Truman has
shown himself to be a petulant
person, not well informed, but
sensitive and suspicious. He
uses the press and then com-
plains when the press fails to
agree with him.
More important still, the
President reveals in his press
conferences that neither he
nor anyone else can be in-
formed about the multifarious
activities of such an immense
government.
What is needed is not a
"clarification" of the news but
of the President's ideas of how
news should be disseminated.
