Gen. Wedemeyer is the first
witness since Gen. MacArthur
finished his testimony a month
ago who has been able to
speak with complete freedom
and frankness. That fact,
combined with his extraordi-
nary qualifications, gives his
views and advice great weight.
★
As a trained strategist who
has dealt with problems in
the no man's land between the
military and political fields, he
ranks very high.
After West Point he ad-
vanced steadily and from 1936
to 1938 attended the German
War College. Subsequently he
was used mainly in plans and
operations, and in the early
period of the war he was
charged with making a report
on the course which should be
followed in the invasion of
Europe.
His ideas, roughly stated,
ran to a course somewhat be-
tween that which was followed
and Churchill's preference for
an attack through the Bal-
kans. In 1944-46 he had the
job of commanding the U.S.
forces in China, which in-
volved the delicate and diffi-
cult task of getting on with
and directing the Nationalist
forces.

When Gen. Marshall arrived
in China for his famous, futile
and unfortunate effort to mix
oil and water, Wedemeyer was
presented with the Marshall
directive. This directive, We-
demeyer now says, had the
name "Vincent" on the corner.
That undoubtedly meant John
Carter Vincent, whose views
are well known.
Wedemeyer disagreed with
the plan to unite the Reds and
the Nationalists, because he
already knew that the Red
leaders were dangerous, de-
voted Communists. Marshall
brushed his objections aside
and virtually commanded him
to help with the directive.
That incident apparently
was a crisis. Wedemeyer had
been what is called a "Mar-
shall man" before. After that
he was not. Nevertheless, be-
cause of his great knowledge
of Asia, he was directed to
make a survey and report.
That report, we now know,
was suppressed by Marshall,
and only a part was later re-
leased.
★
Wedemeyer returned to
Washington for a time and
was director of plans and op-
erations for the general staff
until 1949. Since he felt that
his expert advice was consist-
ently disregarded, he accepted
the detached job at the Pre-
sidio in San Francisco which
he has just left.
His differences with the
brass in Washington now be-
come apparent. He positively
disagreed with the whole idea
of land operations in Korea.
This attitude of Wedemeyer
is not to be taken lightly, since
his expertness in military
strategy and his profound
knowledge of Asia were fully
recognized by Marshall and
his successor as Chiefs of
Staff. Moreover Wedemeyer
has the grim evidence of re-
sults to justify his judgment.
A year of war, with 140,000
casualties, and we are where
we began.
★
He has, moreover, added to
the evidence of the adminis-
tration's devious and wobbly
policies and of the deliberate
deceit of the Department of
State.
If Acheson, and Marshall too,
can remain in office after this,
we shall remain a nation di-
vided, unhappy and profound-
ly lacking in confidence in our
leaders.
