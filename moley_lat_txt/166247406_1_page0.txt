DEWEY CAN
BE FATAL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On the television program
"Meet the Press" last Sunday
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey re-
vealed an unfortunate quality
that has lost him many
friends, antagonized many
who might have been friends,
and probably cost him his
life's ambition, the Presidency.
Moreover, it should be realized
by the supporters of Gen.
Eisenhower that this Dewey
trait may lose for their man,
too.
A reporter asked him about
a statement in the diary of the
late Secretary of Defense For-
restal. Forrestal wrote that
he was discussing politics with
President Truman after the
1948 election: "The President
. mentioned the fact that he
had a letter from Sen. Taft
congratulating him on his elec-
tion and saying that while the
Senator might disagree on cer-
tain matters with the Presi-
dent, he would do everything
possible to co-operate. Taft
in his letter also mentioned
the fact that 'as the President
might gather, neither he nor
his wife were particularly dis-
appointed in the result of the
election.'"
This statement, it should be
noted, was an account written
after a contact with the Presi-
dent. It is not a matter of
record. What Truman said
was casual and from memory,
perhaps made still more un-
trustworthy because of the
great number of letters he had
received and read after his
election. It was heard by For-
restal and written down from
memory. Perhaps it was, as
was the case of much of the
Forrestal diary, told to a sten-
ographer who wrote it down.
That means that the hearing,
speaking and writing of three
people were between this let-
ter and the record in the diary.
Then the reporter on the
television program who asked
Dewey what he thought about
the statement was probably
speaking from memory. And
Dewey himself might or
might not have read the state-
ment in the Forrestal diary.
That puts five fallible people
between what Taft actually
wrote in his letter to the Presi-
dent and the person looking at
and hearing the television pro-
gram.

And Dewey heightened this
by his archly stated answer to
the question. He said, in sub-
stance, that he could not spec-
ulate on what someone else
might do. Then he added
that he could not speculate on
the contents of private corre-
spondence. That was all.
The circumstances sur-
rounding the Taft letter are
these. It was a routine con-
gratulatory letter written in
longhand. [Sen. Taft asked Mr.
Truman for a copy of it after
the broadcast and Mr. Truman
gave it to him yesterday. It
appears on Page 2, Part I
of today's Times.â€”Ed.]
No doubt Forrestal heard
the President mention it in a
Cabinet meeting. The alleged
second part was probably not
in the letter at all. Truman
probably said casually that
"Taft and Mrs. Taft were prob-
ably not disappointed." This
Forrestal took to be a quota-
tion from the letter instead of
a Truman comment on the let-
ter.
*
In the circumstances, in-
stead of the answer Dewey
made, a bigger, more generous
person would have made a
quite different reply in deal-
ing with a notable political
rival in his party. He would
have said that he could not
imagine that Taft wrote any
such thing, that Taft support-
ed him in his 1948 campaign,
and that he refused to believe
it. This would have won
friends for Dewey and for his
candidate, Eisenhower.
This preconvention cam-
paign will come to a sorry end
if fissures and antagonisms
are opened in the Republican
Party that cannot be closed
after the convention next
summer. The Republican Par-
ty will again go down to de-
feat through disunion.
And even before that con-
vention, this Dewey demeanor
and attitude will not only in-
jure the prospects of Gen.
Eisenhower but be exactly
what the supporters of Tru-
man ardently wish and expect.
Dewey is not popular with Re-
publicans over the nation, and
further displays of this sort
will heighten that feeling.
