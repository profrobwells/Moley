HOLIDAYS
OF HOPE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A year has passed since
Herbert Hoover began the
great debate on troops to
Europe. That argument, it will
be remembered, was launched
in a moment when the fear of
war breaking out in Europe
was at its maximum. That
fear, which never swept West-
ern Europe as it did the
United States, has subsided.
For that, at least, we may be
thankful during this holiday
season.
We may also gain some wis-
dom if we review the outcome
and results of that debate and
seek the reasons why the fear
that possessed us last year has
subsided.
â˜…
The debate itself, which was
finally resolved in Congress,
was inconclusive, Neither side
won what it sought, Hoover's
advice that we should avoid
the danger of a land war that
we could not win was not fol-
lowed, because we did agree
to send a number of divisions
to Europe. But at the same
time President Truman lost
his fight to send, without the
authorization of Congress, an
indeterminate number of
ground troops to Western Eu-
rope. The final decision was a
compromise.
The very fact, nowever, that
the President's astonishing
assertion of power was seri-
ously defended by so many
people was evidence of an
overwhelming fear of a Rus-
sian attack. No President in
normal times could possibly
believe that he could station
a great army on foreign soil
without the specific authoriza-
tion of Congress. We can real-
ize that fact now that our fear
has receded,
Certainly, we cannot attrib-
ute our added sense of secu-
rity to the progress that has
been made in arming Europe.
About all that there is to
show for our effort and money
is the fine Eisenhower head-
quarters in Paris. Western Eu-
rope has hardly added any-
thing tangible to its armed
strength. If the intention of
the Soviet is to conquer Eu-
rope, it surely would have
done so before this.
Perhaps the President and
those who were most ardent
in supporting him in last
year's debate will answer that
the Soviet has been deterred
by the fact that we have ex-
pressed a determination to
fight if Western Europe is at-
tacked. But that was not the
real issue in the debate at all.
Both Taft and Hoover, as-
serted that we were commit-
ted when the North Atlantic
pact was adopted. The argu-
ment was largely a matter of
method. The Soviet knew all
along that we would fight.
The reason why our fear has
subsided, therefore, must be
a reconsideration of all the
factors involved. We see now
and we should have seen then
that the real interests of the
Soviet lie in avoiding a gen-
eral war. We have, in short,
overcome our fear by a right
use of our reason.
That does not mean that we
can be indifferent to the pos-
sible danger of a general war.
Our present attitude is an
alert medium between ir-
rational fear and senseless in-
difference. That is one reason
why these are better holidays
than those of 1950.
