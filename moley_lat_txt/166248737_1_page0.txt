MIRACLE
COMING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If all the administration
prophets are right the United
States in the next year or so
is going to accomplish some-
thing that no one ever dreamed
could be accomplished any-
where, anytime.
In fact we are going to run
In the teeth of all economic
laws and, like a cosmic Su-
preme Court, declare them all
to be invalid.
Defense Mobilizer Wilson
says we are going to reach
our production goals in 12
months and that our mild
shortages will be over by that
time. Meanwhile, we shall
have 70% of normal automo-
bile output and enough re-
frigerators and washing ma-
chines to keep us cool and
clean.
If that be true, we should
be mildly concerned about un-
employment a year from now,
for there will be no great un-
fulfilled demands as there were
in 1915.
*
We can balance that wor-
ry against the bright hope for
lower prices of manufactured
goods, since without heavy
shortages and unfulfilled de-
mands there should be no seri-
ous price rise.
But meanwhile, Leon Key-
serling, chairman of the Presi-
dent's economic advisers, has a
springtime speech, already de-
livered in several important
places, in which he is assur-
ing us that inflation is not such
a great menace after all. He
varies the speech somewhat,
although his reassurance about
the harmlessness of inflation
remains the same.
In one rendition of the
speech he says inflation is not
our No. 1 problem—production
is. In a statement to the Sen-
ate Banking Committee, he
says inflation is not our great-
est danger—Communist world
aggression is.
In fact Keyserling grows
eloquent about how beautiful-
ly we have been getting on
with 50 or 60% dollars. "We
have maintained our freedom,"
he says, "increased our pro-
duction and expanded our
economy. The total number of
dollars in our national income
has risen much faster than the
decline in the buying power
of a single dollar."
*
This is cold comfort to the
millions who know that the
decline in the value of their
savings and in the value of
their other sources of income
has certainly had no compen-
sation in their gains.
The real basis of Keyser-
ling's reassurance is political,
not economic. He has been
most adept at smooth double
talk and economic jargon, but
his policies have been infla-
tionary from the beginning.
He has sold a quite receptive
Truman the theory that so
long as an inflated national
income rises, there is no dan-
ger in inflation.
Now it looks as if Keyser-
ling, speaking for the admin-
istration, is preparing the coun-
try for progressive inflationary
stimulants. This reveals the
program for the next year or
so which is, of course, a pre-
election drive.
If the United States can have
adequate and in a year prac-
tically full civilian production,
as the Defense Mobilizer tells
us, and inflation without in-
jury to our people, as Key-
serling says, and victory in a
war fought with wraps on, as
Defense Secretary Marshall
says, we shall indeed be the
prodigy of the ages.
