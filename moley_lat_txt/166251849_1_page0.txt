Socialism Even Sneaks
Into the Defense Bill
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Wilson once con-
fessed that he had a one-track
mind.
President Truman's mind is
a one-way street. Since he
committed himself early in his
administration to a series of
Socialistic plans, he has, de-
spite the opposition of Con-
gress, inflexibly held to all of
them.
â˜…
In the 1951 defense produc-
tion bill now before Congress
there is tucked away in a safe
corner the substance of the
Spence bill of 1949, possibly
the most Socialistic measure
ever seriously presented to
Congress. It authorizes the
President to put the Federal
government directly into al-
most any business and it gives
him discretion as to the place
and time.
Another Truman policy, gov-
ernment medicine, despite re-
peated defeats in Congress and
in State elections, is still ap-
parently a favorite. This was
made clear in the President's
speech at the dedication of the
National Institute of Health
clinical center at Bethesda,
Md. All the old dubious argu-
ments for compulsory health
insurance were given new ex-
pression.
An interesting aspect of the
speech is that the President or
whoever wrote it provides in
the first half of the discourse
a convincing argument against
what is advocated in the sec-
ond half.
He points out that medical
progress during the past half
century has made it possible
for every American child to
expect 18 more years of life.
It is hard to reconcile this
fact with the assertion, which
Truman makes later, that the
American people are patheti-
cally neglected and cannot af-
ford medical care.
Someone surely has been at
work during that half century
saving lives, eradicating dis-
ease and caring for children
and grownups. No credit is
given by the President to
those who have worked faith-
fully in private co-operative
medicine.
Truman asserts that there
have been wonder drugs and
marvelous discoveries in the
determination of the causes
and nature of formerly dead-
ly diseases. But in calculat-
ing the number of doctors
that are needed apparently
no allowance is made for the
plain fact that one doctor,
now armed with new knowl-
edge and these new remedies,
counts for much more than a
doctor did 50 years ago.
It is obvious that more doc-
tors could be used, especially
if, as Truman says, we are to
supply medical care to other
parts of the world. But he fails
to note what progress has
been made in providing more
doctors. He also fails to give
credit for the immense help
that the Rockefeller Founda-
tion and other private agen-
cies have given to backward
countries.
Paul de Kruif, in the June
Reader's Digest, offers facts
and figures on this contro-
versial question of a "doctor
shortage." Owing to the efforts
of the medical profession and
private agencies, including
foundations and the medical
schools, there are better doc-
tors now.
The number of doctors per
1,000,000 has remained sta-
tionary, it is true. But the 1951
doctor not only is a more
skilled practitioner but he has
infinitely better medicine and
tools to work with. The proof
of this is the improved
health and longevity of his
patients.
No one contests the legiti-
mate and useful role of gov-
ernment in research and pub-
lic health. These activities do
not destroy the liberty of doc-
tors and patients and they do
not impose an unbearable
strain on the economy.
It is the danger of bring-
ing the medical profession
within the coils of a political
bureaucracy that critics of
the Truman-Ewing health plan
fear. The President still stub-
bornly offers that dangerous
course as a settled policy of
his administration.
