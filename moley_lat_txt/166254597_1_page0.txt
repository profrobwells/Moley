TARNISHED
SHIELD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Americans may well brace
themselves for a great many
more exposures in 1952 of bad
practices in the Federal gov-
ernment â€” the unearthing of
indiscretions in government
work by a system of chain re-
actions.
Nearly every person who is
forced out of office for his de-
linquencies becomes the em-
bittered bearer of bad news
about others. Hence, it may
be confidently asserted that we
haven't seen anything yet.
The greatest tragedy will
come when the wash of cor-
ruption and indiscretion laps
at the Federal courts. It is get-
ting very close already, be-
cause the Department of Jus-
tice is the anteroom of the ju-
diciary.
*
That department holds vast
discretion in the administra-
tion of the law. It guides mil-
lions of public servants, in-
cluding the President of the
United States, in executing
the nation's laws. It deter-
mines when those laws will
be invoked against citizens. It
also protects all citizens
against invasions of their legal
rights.
Most important, it has tra-
ditionally been a training
ground for prospective judges
of our highest courts. In our
history, many men who have
held the post of Attorney Gen-
eral have been elevated to the
Supreme Court. The late Chief
Justice Stone came from that
office. Justices Jackson and
Clark are current examples of
that tradition.
*
And yet, despite direct warn-
ings by the FBI, Atty. Gen.
(now Mr. Justice) Tom C.
Clark permitted that grotesque
but mischievous clown, Theron
Lamar Caudle, to enter that
place of grave responsibility
and trust. All that Clark is al-
leged to have said when he re-
ceived a warning was, "Will
he embarrass me?"
The answer is that Caudle
lived to embarrass millions of
Americans who are vastly
more sensitive to the dignity
and honor of the nation than
Clark seemed to be. And to
deepen their embarrassment,
Clark is now a member of
their highest and most revered
court.
It is not adding to the luster
of a court that should be above
politics to have directed at the
Chief Justice a chatter of sur-
mise about nominating him
for President. Or to have Mr.
Justice Douglas telling us how
to run the world.
*
The deterioration began, of
course, when Roosevelt in 1937
attempted to make the Court
a responsive tool of the Execu-
tive and later, in a fit of pique,
appointed Hugo Black. Things
were not helped in the years
later by the appointment of
Felix Frankfurter, busying
himself with advice to all and
sundry.
And now there looms a new
investigation of appointments
to the lower Federal courts.
These appointments, too, have
generally been passed out with
little regard for high qualifica-
tions.
The former FBI agent who
warned Clark about Caudle
says: "Then Clark told us
about being on a hunting trip
with Caudle in North Carolina,
and said Caudle told him he'd
like to be a Federal judge
sometime. Clark indicated that
the nomination as Assistant
Attorney General might be a
steppingstone to a Federal
judgeship." Thank Providence
we were spared that!
The old, old lawyer's adage
comes to mind as we survey
the present scene and try to
anticipate the future: "If jus-
tice be thy shield and it be
broken, whence cometh thy
succor?"
