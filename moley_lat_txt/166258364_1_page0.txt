BASKETBALL
SHAME
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The full text of Judge Saul
Streit's statement in sentenc-
ing "fixed" basketball players
should be printed in every ed-
ucational journal in the land.
In that way or in some other
way the presidents and gov-
erning powers of our colleges
should be shamed or fright-
ened or otherwise persuaded
to do what most of them have
shirked doing up to date.
By pure accident of news-
paper composition, perhaps,
there appeared in the New
York Times directly opposite
Judge Streit's arraignment of
college morals a picture of
nine top college administra-
tors from various States hav-
ing a great laugh over some-
thing at which they were
looking. The document could
not have been the judge's
statement. For it is no laugh-
ing matter.

It has long been an unc-
tuous academic habit over the
country to sneer at Tam-
many Hall. Therefore, it is
an ironic turn of events that
Judge Saul Streit is a man
who grew up in Tammany
Hall. When I knew him first,
he was in the State Legislature.
Later he rose to be a General
Sessions judge. The morals he
has found in college athletics
are apparently worse than any-
thing he knew in politics.
The judge's immediate duty
was the sentencing of five
players and one fixer to stiff
prison terms. Nine more pris-
on sentences were suspended.
In dealing out this punish-
ment, he remarked that this
exposure is only "a small
glimpse" of the commercial-
ism that prevails in intercol-
legiate basketball and foot-
ball.

While these defendants were
from New York institutions,
the judge made it clear that
the practices revealed were
quite general over the nation.
Most of the defendants before
entering college had offers
from colleges as far south as
Georgia and as far west as Cal-
ifornia. Specifically, he said
that one of the defendants
"was offered and did accept
from Cincinnati University
scholarships both for himself
and his brother which in-
cluded tuition, board, a job,
$50 a month expense money,
and the use of a car."
These brothers stayed only
two days and then went else-
where, apparently where the
picking was better. Michigan,
William and Mary, Ohio State,
Denver University and other
institutions came in for no
flattering mention. The judge
continued.
"The son of one of the clerks
of my court, now on the
Princeton varsity team, five
months before graduating
from high school received no
less than 15 offers from vari-
ous colleges, ranging from
tuition alone to tuition and
emoluments valued at approx-
imately $2700 per year."
Almost unbelievable tamper-
ing with records of grades
was revealed in this trial. The
judge pointed out that one of
the guilty boys came to the
City College of New York with
a high school average of 70.43,
but the transcript filed at the
college showed 75.5. This still
being low, the college gave
him a high school examina-
tion and a grade of 89.4. A
recomputation of the results
of that examination showed,
however, only 70.62. The
judge says that the high school
transfer sheets show "a pos-
sible alteration, and the upper
right-hand corner is torn."
More apparent tampering
with grades was found in oth-
er cases.
The judge says further that
with the full knowledge of
coaches many basketball play-
ers made $1500 to $2000 per
summer for services in re-
sorts which were payments
for basketball playing.

It did not need this sordid
trial and conviction to tell the
heads of our institutions of
learning that they were per-
mitting this sort of business
to flourish. The president of
a New York college denied a
few years ago that he knew
gambling was going on at Mad-
ison Square Garden, but near-
ly everyone else knew it. And
he did not know, apparently,
that one of the players in the
uniform of his institution was
not even registered—to say
nothing of attending classes
or passing examinations.
The fixers involved are the
scum of the earth, of course.
The boys themselves are no
unsophisticated lambs, as this
trial has shown. The coaches
have been callous to wrong-
doing. But the heads of these
and many other institutions
have been either blind or
stupid or men of soft con-
science.
