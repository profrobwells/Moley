JESSUP AND
STASSEN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Little will be heard of Philip
Jessup until Congress meets
in January, but the questions
he raised linger on.
Harold Stassen in this af-
fair has performed one of the
outstanding services of his
long career in politics. In his
highly controversial testimony
he brought out 10 very impor-
tant facts, nine of which were
subsequently proved and ad-
mitted, and the 10th, which is
still in dispute, may be proved
later.
The gist of these proved
charges indicates that Jessup
was an influential and at times
the dominant member of the
State Department faction that
favored a soft and conciliatory
policy toward Communist
China, that frustrated the ef-
forts of the Chinese National-
ists to retain their ascendancy,
that decided to let Formosa
fall, and that neglected the
plea of India in 1949 to provide
for them a small amount of
our surplus wheat.
The famous white paper,
which was a biased and in-
complete report on the ad-
ministration's China policy,
was edited by Jessup.
According to Stassen, 1945
and 1946 were two very bad
years in our foreign policy. In
those years Acheson, Jessup
and Hiss were the three most
important factors in making
foreign policy. There followed,
according to Stassen, two fair-
ly good years, in which Ache-
son was out of the depart-
ment, Jessup's association was
limited, and Hiss was out.
Then, when Acheson returned
Jessup did, too, and things
turned bad again.
Back over the years before
1945, Jessup manifested a re-
markable habit of joining all
sorts of movements-commit-
tees, organizations, and spon-
sorships. In these his careless-
ness permitted him to get into
pretty doubtful company. All
this was revealed before Stas-
sen offered his testimony.
On the record Jessup is cer-
tainly not shown to be a Com-
munist or a faithless govern-
ment servant. His chief sin
is lack of sound judgment.
Like many others who con-
ceive themselves to be "liber-
al" and broad-minded, he
manifested a lack of insight
into people with whom he as-
sociated himself-a lack of the
jealous care which a respon-
sible person ought to have in
dealing with vital internation-
al problems.
On this background, Jes-
sup's capacity to serve the
nation must be judged. It
must also be judged on the
background of his high and
distinguished academic back-
ground.
He holds one of the highest
positions in the academic
world, the Hamilton Fish pro-
fessorship in international law
in Columbia University. Peo-
ple who hold academic posi-
tions of that kind, like jour-
nalists, should not indiscrim-
inately join committees and
movements. They enjoy the
rare privilege of complete
freedom to express individual
opinions. Hence, they should
always speak and act as in-
dividuals, not through miscel-
laneous round robins and the
like.
When men in such an aca-
demic position serve the gov-
ernment, as they have the
right and duty to do, it should
be for specific assignments
and for limited periods. They
should not become a part of
a faction in a political govern-
ment.
The greatest of Jessup's pred-
ecessors in the Hamilton Fish
professorship was John Bas-
sett Moore. In his long ca-
reer his eminence and detach-
ment from faction were so
great and his ability was so
recognized that he served at
various times and in many ca-
pacities in the administrations
of Cleveland, Harrison,
McKinley, Theodore Roose-
velt, Taft, Wilson, Harding
and Coolidge. But never was
he a partisan member of any
of those administrations.
That great example was
there for Jessup to see, to
know, and to follow. His bad
judgment led him to ignore it.
And he has impaired his place
not only as a scholar and ex-
pert, but as a public servant.
The other day a man whose
knowledge of public affairs is
not wide, but who reads the
headlines and has lots of com-
mon sense said: "Isn't there
anyone in this big country
who can serve as well as Jes-
sup? Is he indispensable?"
The answer is obvious.
The President should have
realized that the issue is not
the vindication of Jessup. It is
to have good service from peo-
ple who enjoy public confi-
dence. Public office should not
be used to vindicate anybody.
Public office is for public serv-
ice.
