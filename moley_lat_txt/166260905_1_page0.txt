PROPHECY
IS RISKY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As this observer left the
Governors' conference in
Gatlinburg last week his con-
clusion about the cloudy po-
litical situation was meas-
urably but not greatly clari-
fied.
As is always the case in a
pre-election year, the con-
ference was buzzing with
speculative political talk. The
preference poll of Republican
Governors was, as has been
reported in the press, nine for
Eisenhower, four for Taft and
12 noncommittal. The large
number who refused to ex-
press a choice is an indication
of how indeterminate the
situation is at this time.
Some of the 12 definitely
have preferences, but for pru-
dential, or rather for political
security reasons they wish to
avoid commitments. A bit of
personal inquiry assures me
that two of them are for Eisen-
hower and two or three pre-
fer Taft to the general.
*
Most of the other noncom-
mittal statesmen are either
nourishing dark-horse ambi-
tions of their own or are look-
ing toward some candidate
other than Taft and Eisen-
hower.
Moreover, among those who
publicly declared for Eisen-
hower there were various
qualifications attached to their
preference. At least one and
probably more of these say
privately that to get their sup-
port at the convention next
summer Eisenhower will have
to give up his European mis-
sion in January or February
and come out definitely as a
Republican and as a candidate.
*
If this does not happen and
if next spring's Presidential
primaries come and go with-
out any sign from the princi-
pal in this Eisenhower move-
ment, the nomination will go
to Taft or to some other au-
thentic Republican.
The situation in the South
was clarified by what Gov.
James Byrnes said at the con-
ference. Perhaps it ought to
he added that the Byrnes
meaning was not exactly con-
veyed by his words, but by
the implications and connota-
tions of his words.
*
The real meaning is that
there will be no Dixiecrat
candidate as there was three
years ago. There will be no
coalition according to the
specifications of the Mundt
plan. The South, however, will
be more independent in its
thinking and voting than it
has been for 75 years. That
means more so than it has
been since the dark days of
the reconstruction.
This gives point and mean-
ing to Byrd's statement in his
Atlanta speech that the Demo-
cratic Party cannot elect a
President without the support
of the South.
These imponderables, north
and south, make it clear why
no one should set himself up as
a prophet. Would-be prophets
should keep in mind what
happened to baseball writers
this year.
These uncertainties and
their implications also make it
clear that 1952 may be the
most interesting political year
in our history.
