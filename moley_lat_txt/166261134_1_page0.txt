Nothing Is Very Stable
About This Stabilizing
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has always seemed to me
that Eric Johnston's personal-
ity and rhetoric ran far be-
yond the bounds of his under-
standing. At least, they ran
far beyond the capacity of
people to understand him.
As president of the United
States Chamber of Commerce,
he told how business was bad
and business was good. No,
not exactly how, but that busi-
ness was bad and good. And
labor was bad and good. And
social justice was all good.
And what he needed was to
march forward and be pro-
gressive, without defining
where he should march or
what it was to be progressive.
I suspect that most people
were charmed when they
heard him and then didn't
think much more about it or
about Johnston, because it
made little difference what
he thought or whether he
thought at all.

But it is different now, be-
cause he has a lot of power.
He is our economic stabilizer,
the grand vizier of prices and
wages, and prices and wages
mean a lot to all of us. And
so we shall have to try to
understand him, for if we do
not understand him, we may
be doing something that will
unstabilize us. That would be
very bad indeed.
Whether we believe it or
not, we are stabilized, or we
were when Johnston first
took this job. Of course, a lot
of us have been feeling un-
stabilized for a long, long
time and our only hope was
that in our giddy whirl we
would ultimately fall on the
softest possible spot and break
as few economic bones as pos-
sible.
So I confess that, while I
have tried to understand
Johnston, I am more confused
than ever.
On Aug. 3, the Wage Sta-
bilization Board decided to
permit raises. All wage earn-
ers were told that they could
negotiate escalator wage in-
creases, based on the cost of
living. This was approved by
the Wage Stabilizer who, prior
to that, had approved wage
escalators which were al-
ready incorporated in wage
contracts.
Then Johnston said: "It will
have a definitely stabilizing
effect by setting the pattern
of wage adjustments geared
to changes, up and down, in
the cost of living." That is, it
would stabilize instability.
Johnston, since his initia-
tion in the Fair Deal, has ac-
quired a glib familiarity with
the bureaucratic vocabulary,
as is shown by the next sen-
tence: "This is an appropriate
yardstick in the present peri-
od." The word "yardstick" has
been a Washington word
ever since President Roose-
velt used it to describe his
public-power policy years ago.
It turned out to be another
kind of stick altogether.
Johnston says further: "Rig-
orous enforcement of the pro-
gram is essential to prevent
the cost of living from sky-
rocketing to new heights."
Thus he says in one sen-
tence that the policy is "def-
initely stabilizing" and in an-
other that it may get out of
control. How would it get out
of control and skyrocket? Per-
haps by permitting the grant-
ing of increases greater than
the rise in the cost of living.
★
Then, in the third sentence
quoted above he admits that
changes in wages will increase
the cost of living. Otherwise,
it would not skyrocket because
of careless enforcement. But
how can anything stabilize
anything when it will itself
unstabilize everything? Where
is the stabilizing effect of
something that directly affects
the cost of living?
When these escalator Rube
Goldbergs came up in the late
war, they were unhinged be-
cause the government said
they would be inflationary.
Now they are going to stabil-
ize.
Finally, Johnston said, after
the new Defense Production
Act was passed in July, that
the cost of living would rise
5 to 8% in the next few
months. Perhaps what is need-
ed is something to stabilize
Stabilizer Johnston.
