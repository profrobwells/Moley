Federal Gambling Taxes
Make Betting Too Costly
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If Congress enacted the new
tax bill to reform people, the
tax on bookmakers will help.
But everybody thought that
the President and Congress
wanted to raise revenue. This
feature of the new law most
certainly will not help much.
Certainly the estimate that it
will yield $400,000,000 is a
fairy tale. And fairy tales will
buy no guns and pay no bureaucrats.
This estimate was based up-
on the guess, which is no more
than that, that $4,000,000,000
is involved. Maybe so. But a
10% tax levied on a guess and
exacted from a collection of
shadows will not come out the
way the multiplication table
says it will.
★
Two taxes are aimed at the
bookies. One is an occupation
tax, which requires them to
pay $50 and file their names,
addresses, and occupation. No-
body except Congress expects
more than a handful of this
numerous profession to do
anything of the sort.
The bookie business is il-
legal everywhere except in
Nevada. Thus, the bookie is
expected to tell the govern-
ment that he is violating the
law. I grant that these people
are outside the law, but they
are inside the Constitution
whether they know it or not.
And no one can constitutional-
ly be compelled to testify to
anything that will incriminate
him.
Since a great many bookies
will quit the business or op-
erate under greater cover than
ever, the wire services will
probably disappear. This is
the opinion of Bill Corum, the
best judge I know. It will hap-
pen because the wire service
is very expensive and cannot
be maintained for the small
number of surviving book-
makers. This, continues Cor-
um, will immensely reduce
the volume of bets away from
the tracks, because under a
nonwire system the person
who gambles will not follow
up his first bet with another
and another. The bookie will
thus handle only the initial
bet of the customer for that
day.
For those who still use the
bookies who will be left, the
cost will rise very high. The
"honest" gambling people now
take from 16 to 17% from the
customer. The 10% tax will
bring that up to 26 to 30%,
which is an almost impossi-
ble handicap to profit.
This is better, however,
than the break the customer
gets from slot machines in Ne-
vada and elsewhere where
they are legal. It has been
noted frequently that the di-
vision of the money in such
regulated places is 40% for
the customer and 60% for the
machine. Wishing to test this
and, I confess, also for the
entertainment, I experimented
in four Nevada towns last
summer.
My method was to use 100
nickels per test and put the
money that came out in a
separate pile, not to be "rein-
vested" then.
★
The break averaged almost
exactly at the 40-60 level. The
cost of the "entertainment"
was around $3 for the hour
consumed each time. This re-
turn to the customer is high
compared with what he is ac-
corded in the places where the
"slots" are illegal. There, the
customer is sometimes lucky
to get back 10% of what he
puts in.
In the case of the tax on
racing, the result may be to
increase the amount spent at
the tracks and in pari-mutuels.
Corum considers this a possi-
bility but not a certainty.
The reform objective of Con-
gress will be effective because
betting through bookies will
greatly decline. Perhaps the
dollars saved will flow into
more useful and productive
and taxable channels. But for
revenue sources, Congress will
have to look elsewhere.
