Tax on Capital Gains
Affects the Working Man
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If the general public could
comprehend more clearly the
role that new capital plays
in our national life, we would
be hearing more protests
against the growing burden
of taxes, once more under-
lined in the terms of the new
tax bill. It is true that when
tax days come there will be
plenty of groaning. But that
will largely be from people
who hate to see the amounts
left to live on shrinking still
further.

This pinch on individuals
is very serious, it is true. But
a deeper injury is done by
the enlarging bite taken out
of big incomes by the govern-
ment. This is the progressive
drying up of our sources of
new capital, the nourishment
without which natural growth
will stop and decay will set
in.
The average wage earner
no doubt takes the basis of his
job for granted. The rich em-
ployer, he thinks, buys the
plant and machinery at which
he works. Somehow, the stuff
he makes is sold, and out of
the proceeds he is paid his
wages. He is suspicious about
the profits that the company
keeps out of earnings. Dema-
gogic labor leaders tell him
that those profits are enor-
mous and that stockholders
are getting an unfair share.
The company, too, he is told,
is holding out a big chunk of
those earnings--much too big
for comfort.
★
Never is he told by those
trumpeters for higher wages
that the money withheld out
of earnings is what makes
possible his own employment.
Instead, he is told that he
should not be taxed, because
there is plenty of money in
the higher incomes that pro-
vides fine houses, luxuries,
and waste. He is not told that
out of those higher incomes
and company surpluses there
has always come the life-giv-
ing capital that makes for jobs
and good wages.
A few figures based on the
new tax rates, properly inter-
preted, ought to dispel his il-
lusions. For they show how
little there is left for new
capital and how meager the
return will be on new invest-
ments in industry.
Let us take as an example
a married person whose in-
come is $16,000 a year. The
government under the new
bill takes $4396 in income tax,
leaving him $11,604. This per-
son lives at a reasonably care-
ful standard, and after his
bills are paid he has, perhaps,
$1000 left for investment. This,
it may be said, is a fairly good
record of savings for such a
person, considering the de-
mands upon him in his sta-
tion in life. At any rate, let's
say he has saved it.
It is capital, and he wants
to put it to work. Then he con-
sults a tax man, who tells him
the following:
★
"Under the new tax law, if
you invest your $1000 in new
stock in an old corporation,
the return to you for each
dollar earned by that company
will be very small. If the cor-
poration earns 12% before
taxes, or $120 on your $1000,
the government will take $84,
and you will get $36. If your
corporation makes 30%, or
$300 before tax on your $1000,
the excess profits rates will
apply. Then the government
will take $244 of those dollars,
and you will get $56.
"Now I am assuming that
you will be wise or lucky
enough to pick a company
that will make such earnings
as these. You can't buy with
any such assurance. Nor can
you be certain that the com-
pany will make that much a
year later or a year after that.
It is probable that on an aver-
age over 10 years your re-
turn will be still less. Also,
there is the probability that
taxes will rise, and the bite
of the government will be still
greater and your return still
less."

This simple illustration will
show why capital will be scarc-
er and scarcer as the years
pass, why companies will be
unable to expand or even to
maintain the efficiency of their
present plants. And when cap-
ital dries up, industry lags
and jobs will be harder to get.
For capital makes jobs.
