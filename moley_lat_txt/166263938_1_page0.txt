N.Y. POLICE
UNION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

On many occasions Michael
J. Quill has terrorized the citi-
zenry of New York and has
shaken the political assurance
of its elected officials.
As head of the CIO Trans-
port Workers Union he com-
mands the loyalty of thou-
sands of public employees up-
on whose service the very
life and peace and safety of
the city's millions depend.
Over and over they have been
threatened with a suspension
of their transportation facili-
ties.
Quill is also a politician of
threatening proportions. He
makes no bones about his
radical views and also believes
that a union leader who calm-
ly keeps the tradition of Sam-
uel Gompers and sticks to his
job of merely getting better
pay and working conditions
for his members is a hopeless
relic of the past. Quill active-
ly promotes candidates for of-
fice and runs for office for him-
self. Hence, his activity as
a union leader and organizer
has serious political as well
as economic significance.

Quill has now seized upon
certain reasonable grievances
of the New York police force
to come forth as its champion
against the administration of
Mayor Impellitteri. He has
started to enroll members of
the force in his Transport
Workers Union. His claim is
that he already has enrolled
4500 of the 19,000 members.
Faced by this threat to a
long-standing principle, Police
Commissioner Monaghan is-
sued an order that no member
of the force should be a mem-
ber of any labor union and
that anyone who joins or re-
fuses to resign from the TWU
will be subject to disciplinary
action.
The situation in which the
city government now finds it-
self is a quite natural conse-
quence of continuous mixing
of politics with the strict, im-
partial and honest enforce-
ment of the law. Members of
the force told me during the
late Fiorello LaGuardia's ad-
ministration that they simply
could not enforce the law and
keep order in Harlem and oth-
er difficult sections because
the Mayor's office would not
permit them to use sufficiently
vigorous methods.

Thus, the Mayor's concern
for votes in such sections—
votes not only for himself but
for other New Deal candi-
dates, including the President
—was so great that the inter-
ests of public safety were im-
periled. When William O’Dwy-
er was campaigning for Presi-
dent Truman and others in
1948 and for himself in 1949,
he cried out in well-simulated
indignation about the Taft-
Hartley Act as a “slave labor
law.”
The poultry now come home
to roost. After years of fooling
around with Quill’s threats to
paralyze a vital city service,
the labor dictator is embold-
ened to seize control of the
police.

Fortunately, the first round
in the courts has been won
by the Commissioner, Justice
Breitel, who used to be Gov.
Dewey’s executive counsel, has
refused to enjoin the Commis-
sioner. He pointed out in his
opinion that, while this issue
has never been drawn in New
York, it has arisen many times
elsewhere, and always the
courts have sustained the right
of a police head to prohibit
members of the force from
joining labor unions.
There are police unions in
more than 60 cities. Of course,
the AFL incorporates a provi-
sion against strikes in the
charter. But in those cities,
too, the reckoning will come
sooner or later.
For the issue is much more
than the right to strike. It is
the necessity that the police-
man have complete and un-
divided loyalty. The city
should pay him well and pro-
vide benefits commensurate
with the risks he runs and
the devotion he must manifest
in his job.
But a union is not the only
way these values can be, se-
cured. In the New York case,
it would mean loyalty to a
political as well as an econom-
ic master.
