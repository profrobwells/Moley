THE BOOM'S
THE THING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is too early to speculate
on the outcome, but it is easy
to see the underlying plan of
the President in his fiscal poli-
cies over the next five years.
Perhaps it would be unkind to
call it a "five-year plan," but
that seems to be the general
idea. As is true of most of his
plans, this one has a specific
political objective. But the
politics in it is carefully hid-
den behind a screen of eco-
nomic jargon.
The President's first objec-
tive in this budget, as in pre-
ceding budgets, is to get a
vast amount of money appro-
priated by Congress-far more
than he or anyone else could
possibly spend in the fiscal
year covered by the budget.
★
There is a tremendous back-
log of appropriations already
made and available for the
President to spend. There
seems to be some confusion,
however, about how much that
backlog is. Appropriations al-
ready made and unspent
would finance not only what
will be spent until June 30 but
would carry through the next
fiscal year.
There will be, according to
the Budget Director, on June
30, $72,800,000,000 of present ap-
propriations still unspent. It
should be emphasized that this
would be true if none of the
present request for $85,400,000,-
000 should be voted. Presum-
ably, most of the President's
present requests will be voted,
especially those which deal
with the military. Thus he will
have to play with by July a
sum which will range some-
where between $150,000,000,000
and $175,000,000,000.
★
Then his plan is to bring
military expenditures up to
what is called a "peak" about
a year from now. That "peak"
would be about $5,000,000,000
of expenditure a month. Then,
according to Assistant Defense
Secretary McNeil, there will
be a plateau of expenditures
running on at the $5,000,000,-
000-a-month rate "indefinite-
ly."
Mr. McNeil says that he does
not know where this decision
to flatten out rather than to
start a decline was made, but
it is a fair inference that it
was a politico-economic deci-
sion by the President and his
economic advisers after con-
sultation with the military peo-
ple.
The President, on the con-
trary, says that this $5,000,000,-
000-a-month rate will not con-
tinue indefinitely, but that aft-
er running at that rate for 18
months it will begin to taper
off. The tapering-off point will
be July, 1954. Then it will de-
cline slowly until it reaches
$3,300,000,000 a month in 1956.
★
The President is therefore
assuring us that a business
boom will be maintained
throughout the next Presi-
dential term. There is no oth-
er reason why 1956 should be
selected. It cannot be diplo-
matic or military. It must be
political.
This maintenance of mili-
tary spending, accompanied by
progressive increases of wel-
fare projects, pork barrel rec-
lamation schemes, agricultural
benefits and rising wages, is
what the President says in his
message "reflects the progress
we have made so far and it
lays the groundwork for fur-
ther progress."
If this be progress, then ret-
rogression must be something
too horrible to conceive. What
most of us are wondering is
what we will do after Mr.
Truman's five-year plan is
over.
