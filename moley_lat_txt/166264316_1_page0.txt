SAME TUNE,
SLOWLY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If Winston Churchill were
not so familiar with American
government, he might have
been puzzled as he watched
and listened while President
Truman addressed Congress.
For he was witnessing some-
thing that could not happen in
England, or, in fact, in any
member of the British Com-
monwealth. It was a socialis-
tic chief of state advising a
conservative legislature.
Throughout the long and
quite pointless message there
ran a note of frustration. This
was not surprising, consider-
ing the events of the last
three years and the present
situation in our Federal gov-
ernment.

This President probably is
facing his final year in office.
He has doggedly and repeat-
edly presented a program to
Congress which would, if adopt-
ed, move this republic far
along the road to Socialism—
perhaps beyond the point of
no return.
The last Congress and its
predecessors have just as stub-
bornly rejected the program.
The Congress rejected it when
Republican Martin sat in the
Speaker’s chair, and it rejected
it when Democrat Rayburn re-
turned to that place. Votes on
every vital item on the Fair
Deal, whether in committee or
in either house, were negative.
The coalition, ignoring party
names, has stood fast for a
conservative course. And
these conservative Congress-
men and Senators, North and
South, have been sustained by
the people behind them. Their
mandate is more recent, more
fresh and meaningful than is
the President’s.
Congress has held the line,
and about all that the Presi-
dent can say is: “We will have
to give up some things; we
will have to go forward on
others at a slower pace.”
★
But he leaves behind him in
his retreat a clear declaration
that the war for the welfare
state is not over. He recites
the tiresome list of Fair Deal
proposals: more and more
power; and reclamation proj-
ects; more housing; Federal
aid for education; socialized
medicine, by whatever name
it may be called; more for pen-
sions; some modification of the
Brannan proposals for perish-
able crops.
Finally, the South is notified
that there will be no peace on
the civil rights front. This as-
sures the continuation of
southern resistance in Con-
gress. If the Humphrey civil
rights proposals are adopted
by the Democratic convention
in July, a real third ticket will
appear in many of the South-
ern States.
In short, the President’s de-
termination still is to enlarge
Federal power and progres-
sively to move government in-
to the area of individual lib-
erty. The Fair Deal is not
dead, nor is it sleeping.
