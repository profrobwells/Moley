PORK BARREL REVISITED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Back in the dear, dead days
of fantastic illusions around
1920, Congress thought it had
destroyed the pork barrel by
passing a law establishing a
Presidential budget. Those
were the days when America
thought that it had ended
wars and made Europe safe
for democracy, that the demon
rum was exorcised by consti-
tutional amendment, that a
normal life would come with
Harding, that the armament
race would end with a confer-
ence, and that Mellon had es-
tablished economy in govern-
ment.
Those were the days when
a little French dunce named
Coue was selling books and
lectures to us about how all
we had to do to get better was
to think we were. Those were
days when politicians like
Hugo Black sought fame and
high office by buying night-
shirts and Harry Truman
was planning a career in pri-
vate business.

Dr. Paul Douglas and this
writer were young college
teachers who, in our respec-
tive institutions of high ideals
and some illusions, were
teaching young people—at
least I was—about the de-
struction of the pork barrel.
As is so often the case with
academic people, we over-
looked the personal element.
An economy-minded Presi-
dent armed with a budget
can hold a greedy Congress at
bay, but unless the President
is strong and frugal, Congress
will have its expensive way.
John Nance Garner once told
me out of the vast wisdom he
had gained in 30 years on the
Hill: "We can have a non-
political President but never
a nonpolitical Congress."

Dr. Douglas, now Senator
from Illinois, clearly recog-
nizes that the pork barrel is
still with us. It is now a
hogshead, as compared with
the keg of McKinley's day. It
is bursting with appropria-
tions for every ditch that car-
ries water in the rainy season
and for every river that occa-
sionally gets out of bounds.
Unless something is done,
this thing will swamp our
economy and overwhelm
every taxpayer. I for one be-
lieve that such a catastrophe
can be avoided only by the
election of a strong and fru-
gal President, Democrat or
Republican, who can think of
the total national welfare in-
stead of the sum of all the
little welfares.
*
Lest this be interpreted as
a plea for the Republican
Party, let it be said that the
two most valiant champions
of economy in the present
Senate are Democrats: Sen.
Harry Byrd, as always, and
Sen. Paul Douglas since he
has been an articulate mem-
ber.
The approaches of the two
Senators differ. Sen. Byrd pe-
riodically presents an amend-
ed and abbreviated list of ap-
propriations covering the
whole field of government.
Sen. Douglas introduces lists
of amendments to appropri-
ations as they come to the
floor. Both of these advocates
of economy are curtly per-
mitted to present their pleas.
Then they are snapped at by
both sides, Republican and
Democrat alike, and they are
then overwhelmed by votes
for more spending.

Last week, Sen. McKellar
brought in a bill includ-
ing many appropriations for
rivers and harbors in which
his committee had restored
about $100,000,000 which had
been denied by the more con-
servative House. The McKel-
lar plea was mainly that, since
we are spending money for
such purposes in Burma and
other remote places under the
ECA, American communities
should not be denied.
Douglas proposed a series
of cuts amounting to $50,000,-
000. Thereupon, a number of
Senators, mostly Republican,
screamed loudly for their
States and communities. The
Douglas effort was unavail-
ing, just as other similar ef-
forts of his have failed in the
past.
His efforts stand out, how-
ever, in a Congress that seems
to be indifferent to a flood
that will certainly come if all
these measures are passed as
they have been in this ses-
sion of Congress. That is the
flood of inflation.
