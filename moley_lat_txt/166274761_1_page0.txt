New Taxes Not Needed,
the Figures Show Clearly
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since the fiscal year 1951
has ended with a surplus of
$3,300,000,000 instead of the
President's predicted deficit
of $2,700,000,000, it is clearly
the duty of the Senate to rip
apart and recast the House
bill which increases taxes
by the amount of more than
$7,000,000,000. There is no
need for any such increase
this year. There may be
need for much less than
$7,000,000,000 next year.
In this revision the Senate
should brush aside all the
discredited predictions and re-
quests of the President and
Secretary Snyder. They have
been so wrong in the past that
they cannot be relied upon in
the present and in the future.

In round figures the President in January predicted an
income from existing taxes
in fiscal 1952 of about $55,000,-
000,000 and expenditures of
$71,000,000,000. He therefore
demanded tax increases of
$16,000,000,000. This was too
absurd to merit any consideration. In fact he and Secretary
Snyder revised their tax
increase demands downward
to $10,000,000,000 within a
month. The House bill would
provide an estimated $7,000,-
000,000.
A few plain figures show
the prospective needs for fiscal
1952, which we are just
entering. We have just completed a year with a surplus
of $3,300,000,000. In addition
we have a surplus in trust
funds for Social Security and
like purposes of an amount
estimated at $2,000,000,000.
This is available for conversion into nonnegotiable bonds.
The cash is available for ordinary government expenses.
There will be cash operating
margin in the Treasury of
some hundreds of millions.
If no new taxes are passed by
Congress the Treasury will
have, with these surpluses
and cash reserves, in the current six months between $34,-
000,000,000 and $36,000,000,000
to spend.
Since Truman's estimate of
the whole fiscal 1952 expenditures has been revised downward to $68,000,000,000 and less
will be needed in the first half
than the second half of fiscal
1952, we shall be well ahead
by Jan. 1 without new taxes.
Then, when Congress returns in January it can take a
new look at the tax situation.
The prospect then will probably be that no new taxes will
be necessary at all for fiscal
1952, because while defense
expenditures will be rising
there will be spare money to
pay for them. The schedule
for defense expenditures for
fiscal 1952 is $9,500,000,000 for
the first quarter; $12,500,000,-
000 for the second; $13,900,-
000,000 for the third, and $14,-
700,000,000 for the fourth. This
is a rise but not a spectacular
one.
*
And all this does not take
into consideration the possibility of cuts in unnecessary expenditures. Sen. Byrd estimates such possible cuts at between $7,000,000,000 and $9,-
000,000,000. Even half or a
third of this would greatly
brighten the picture. And if
the Korean war is over most
of the money now pouring
into it can be saved. With
armament production increasing, there will be still more
money going into the Social
Security trust funds for spending.
Thus the prospect is that
with no tax increases or with
very reasonable ones in 1952
we can finish fiscal 1952 in
good shape, perhaps without a
deficit. Certainly there is no
need for rushing the present
confiscatory House tax bill.
