Nobody Has Yet Shown
a Case for New Taxes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As Sen. George's Senate Finance Committee prepares to
frame a new tax bill for the
present fiscal year, about all
that various witnesses agree
upon is that they do not want
the bill which was passed by
the House.
They are right in their
opinion of the House bill. It
was one of the most unfair,
unsound and badly planned
tax bills in history. It was
jammed through the Ways
and Means Committee by a
straight party vote.
Then the committee found
that the levies would not only
take all of some incomes, but
in some cases would take
more than 100%. Then it
amended the bill and jammed
it through the House. To put
a bill through and let the Senate
take out the bugs is an
old custom. This time there
are so many bugs that it will
be easier to destroy the bill
and write another. That is
what Sen. George proposes to
do.
The President opposes the
House bill because it does not
raise enough. He wants $10,-
000,000,000 more in new taxes.
Eric Johnston, representing
the administration's economic
stabilization setup, wants to
stop inflation by taking money
away from the consumers. His
reasoning is that if enough
money is taken away from
people by taxation they will
not have it to spend and hence
they will not bid up prices.
This has been a favorite
New Deal and Fair Deal argument
for years. Its use by Eric
Johnston shows how completely
the government spending
people have taken over the
former president of the Chamber
of Commerce of the
United States.
Stabilizer Johnston could
not, however, if he wants to
stay with President Truman,
agree with the proposal of the
National Association of Manufacturers to levy a tax that
really hits the income groups
where most of the spending
power of the nation is located.
The NAM proposal is a
manufacturer's sales tax levied
on goods at the point where
they leave the manufacturer
for the wholesale and retail
trade.
Sens. George and Byrd favor
cutting down appropriations
for spending before coming to
tax increases. George suggests
a cut of $6,000,000,000. Byrd
would go higher.
Both men know exactly
where the cuts could be made
without injuring the defense
effort. But when such proposals are actually made in
the Senate somebody finds a
reason why every item is essential to the preservation of
the nation and of his own constituents.
Both the administration and
the NAM, and to a degree
Sens. George and Byrd, seem
to take for granted that the
President's budget of spending, even if it were not cut,
would require something like
the amount suggested in new
taxes.
And yet no real case has
been made for new taxes at
all. All that we hear of are
great and indeterminate expenditures for defense. The
fact is that with the present
schedule of taxes we would
nearly if not fully balance the
budget.
The committee should ignore the Truman-Snyder figures, which have been consistently and outrageously
wrong, and determine for itself just how much money is
needed for next year.
