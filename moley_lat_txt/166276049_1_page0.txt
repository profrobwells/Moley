The Product Is Studied
but the Market Ignored
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If Republicans could be dis
posed to view their problem
as would a business concern,
their chances might be better
in 1952. But instead of consid
ering their potential market
first, they seem to be intrigued
with the sort of product they
will have to sell—that is, the
candidate.
The product must be good,
to be sure. But the market
must be measured and can-
vassed or the product may
not be sold.
Turning to the market,
which in this case means the
potential voters of the nation,
the Republican problem is
very serious. Since the last
Republican President was
elected in 1928 a great deal has
happened.
To begin with, a great many
people have moved from the
country to cities, large and
small. The year 1920 was dis-
tinguished, among other rea-
sons, as the census year in
which for the first time the
urban population exceeded
the rural, It did so by nearly
3,000,000.
During the decade follow-
ing that year the difference
between urban and rural pop-
ulation rose to 15,000,000. This
migration slowed down in the
next decade somewhat, but
the gap grew slightly.

But in the 1940s the move-
ment gained momentum. No
exact figures are available,
but it is a safe guess that the
excess of urban over rural
populations will in 1952 be
nearly 30,000,000. The national
ratio will be 60-40.
The number of eligible vot-
ers cannot exactly be deter-
mined. All that the census can
tell you is that in 1950 nearly
97,000,000 people were over
21. That means that nearly
100,000,000 will be of voting
age in 1952. Some of them,
however, will be ineligible
because they are aliens or for
some other reason.
A conservative guess is that
there will be about 95,000,000
eligible voters in 1952, divid-
ed roughly 60-40 between ur-
ban and rural.
Meanwhile, the voting
strength of both political par-
ties has declined over the last
10 years, despite the fact that
nearly 12,000,000 new eligibles
appeared. Willkie received 22,-
300,000 votes in 1940; Dewey,
22,000,000 in 1944. Then, de-
spite the return of millions of
soldiers and the natural
growth of population, Dewey
in 1948 fell below his 1944
figure.
*
The Democratic vote de-
clined, too—from 26,800,000 in
1940 to 24,100,000 in 1948. But
in 1948 Thurmond took away
a million and Wallace another
million. Allowing for these
defections, the Democrats
were still short of their 1940
figure.
Thus, the two parties have
declined in voting potential
while millions have been add-
ed to the market. That non-
voting market is colossal. It
numbers between 40,000,000
and 50,000,000. The party that
makes the most intelligent ef-
fort to dip into this can win.
But the Republican effort
must be greater because of the
enormous drift to the cities.
Traditionally the Democrats
have done better in urban dis-
tricts. It can be assumed that
this is still true.
Roosevelt, with great cun-
ning, saw this drift to the
cities and shifted his policies
after 1935 to that market. In
1932 the center of his appeal
was his farm program. He was
silent on labor. In 1936 he pre-
sented his great services to la-
bor. The Wagner Act and So-
cial Security were his ace
cards.
It is not necessary or even
wise for Republicans to outbid
Democrats in benefits for la-
bor. But they must make labor
realize that its true interest
is in a sound economy, free
institutions and individual en-
terprise. For unless the Repub-
lican Party can make progress
in urban districts, it is doomed
to be a minority party.
