Churchill's Tories Split
on Britain's Road Ahead
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There has been nothing in
Anthony Eden's cautious re-
marks in his American tour
to indicate any division in
the Conservative. Party of
which he is a notable mem-
ber, but there are constant
rumors in his own country
to indicate it.
There seem to be two ele-
ments in the Conservative
Party that are not entirely
happy with Churchill's con-
tinued leadership. One of
these found public expression
through Lord Salisbury, who
opposed Churchill's support of
Foreign Secretary Morrison's
policy in Iran. These people
say that Churchill has become
so fearful of the effect of So-
cialist criticism of him as a
"warmonger" that he has
adopted an almost timid ap-
proach in foreign policy. The
Salisbury people favor an old-
time aggressiveness in dealing
with Russia and its satellites.
Another group in the Con-
servative Party is mainly com-
posed of younger Members of
Parliament who resent what
they call the Churchill em-
phasis on "the tight little is-
land."

It is their belief that Brit-
ish greatness can be restored
by aggressive economic enter-
prise throughout the world.
They see no future in an Eng-
land for England. The re-
sources are simply not there,
and the burden of social leg-
islation for a crowded popula-
tion will doom everyone to a
state of semipoverty.
These young Conservatives
want to restore some of that
spirit of enterprise that was
once the admiration of the
world. They assert that Social-
ism represents the abject
surrender of a nation that is
content to grow old and take
in sail, and that Conserva-
tives should make no compro-
mise with Socialist principles.
I heard this sentiment quite
freely expressed by Members
of Parliament during the
British campaign in 1950. I
must confess that it made a
great deal of sense to me.

There are other elements
in Conservative discontent. It
is always a habit in a big po-
litical party for members to
feel that they are being neg-
lected and that a little group
is making all the decisions.
Others have disagreed with
the strategy of the past year,
during which the Conserva-
tive high command called for
successive votes of confidence
in the hope that they would
catch the Socialists off guard
and overthrow the govern-
ment. This policy did not suc-
ceed, and because of it there
was a failure to win over the
country by more activity and
speeches outside Parliament.
All these dissidents admire
Churchill as a public hero
and are immensely grateful
for his war services. But they
feel, for all these reasons, that
the party might have a better
chance in the next election
if Eden or someone else
should lead the party.
However, there is not like-
ly to be any change in lead-
ership before the next elec-
tion. Churchill is vigorous,
eloquent, and intent upon re-
maining at the head of the
party. He wants to be Prime
Minister once more. There is
every evidence that the So-
cialists are hopelessly divided
and that the country has
turned against them. Perhaps
this Conservative discontent
is merely the evidence of
healthy party life.
