It's Getting So That Farmers
Aren't Allowed to Pay a Bill
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Any protest against the
failure of the President to
show in his budget any signs
of real economy will be met
by two replies: first, "Most
of the budget is for war and
defense"; second, "What would
you eliminate?" As late as
last Sunday that faithful ad-
ministration wheel horse, Ma-
jority Leader John W. McCor-
mack, intoned those chest-
nuts.
I would like to put in the
record a reply from a woman
in a Midwestern State. She
noted in this column two
weeks ago some comments
about the extravagant use of
automobiles in Washington.
The import of her letter is
that I don't know the half of
it.
I agree, and until there are
collected thousands of in-
stances such as this from
thousands of American com-
munities no one can know
the whole story of Federal ex-
travagance.
My correspondent does not
want to be quoted directly or
have herself identified. I shall
respect her wishes but con-
vey as well as possible the
great good sense of her let-
ter.
There are four Federal
automobiles in her town used
for the Federal farm pro-
gram. Four government em-
ployees use these cars to visit
"farm units," 4-H Clubs, con-
ventions, etc. These "farm
units" seem to be clubs first
started by private farm or-
ganizations in co-operation
with the State college.
The solicitous bureaucrats
have told these once private
volunteer clubs that their
members need no longer pay
dues. Uncle Sam will supply
speakers and bushels of read-
ing material.
My correspondent says that
the farm women who are thus
made the beneficiaries of a
paternal government are
"plenty smart," they have
plenty of money, and are ca-
pable of supporting their own
clubs.
She goes on to say that out-
side her town is another
woman bureaucrat employed
by the Rural Electrification
Administration. She has a car
which she uses to go from
farm to farm to tell farm
women where to put their elec-
tric lights. My correspondent
repeats that these farm wom-
en are well educated, practical
people who could figure out for
themselves where to put
their lights.
A friend of my correspond-
ent has a farm on which a
field was "washed" by the
heavy rains last summer. She
decided to plant alfalfa on this
field to stop the erosion and
when she went to purchase the
seed she was given a slip and
was told that the government
wanted to pay 60% of the
cost.
This was for "flood loss" or
"soil conservation." The wom-
an did not need the help. She
had plenty of money.
A farmer in the same com-
munity made an excavation
on his land for the purpose of
creating a pond, partly for his
livestock, partly for looks. To
his amazement, he received a
check from the government
for $150. His pond had become
a "soil conservation project."
He wrote to protest. It was
his idea, and he could well af-
ford to pay for it. The govern-
ment replied that they in-
sisted on paying and that
furthermore they were going
to pay him another $150 next
year for his pond.
It is possible that when the
news of the pond gets into an-
other department, he will have
visits from wildlife bureau-
crats with a supply of fish for
his pond.
Even if these farmers were
in the depth of a depression,
this sort of paternalism would
not be justified. But when, as
we are told by the President,
the American farmer is bet-
ter off than ever in history,
such bureaucratic frosting on
the cake is repellent to any-
one with a sense of American
traditions of self-help. What
kind of people do these
bureaucrats think we are?
And what kind of craven de-
pendents are they trying to
make of us?
