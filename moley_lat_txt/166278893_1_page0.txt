All the Wealthy Earn
Couldn't Pay Our Taxes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The action of the Democratic members of the House Ways and Mearis Committee in jamming through the 12¼% tax increase on personal incomes was another gesture toward loading the higher costs of government on the higher income brackets.
To give the impression that any considerable additional part of the cost of government can be carried by those brackets is not only bad economics, but an outrageous effort to deceive the American people.
However, since demagogues are constantly propagating that fallacy, it may be well to point out just how much the people in the high brackets could pay, even if the government should take not a part but all of their income.
The people in the higher brackets are already paying so much that if all they have remaining after taxes were taken, it would pay only a small fraction of the additional cost of government.

The latest available figures on this point are in the U.S. Treasury's statistics of income for 1948. These will suffice for our purpose, because while those figures may be somewhat higher before tax in fiscal 1952, their taxes will be still higher. The conclusions I draw, therefore, may be regarded as understatements.
If in 1948 the government had taken all the money remaining in reported incomes over $10,000, it would have realized an additional $20,793,000,000. (I am using round figures throughout.) That amount would run the government in fiscal 1952 exactly 108 days.
If the government had taken all the remaining incomes of those reporting more than $25,000, it would have gathered only $8,880,000,000 more. This would run the 1952 government 46 days.
If it had taken all the remaining income from those reporting more than $50,000, it would have got only $4,080,000,000 more. This would carry us 21 days in 1952.
If it had taken all the remaining income of people with $100,000 or more, the gain would have been $1,720,000,000. This would do for nine days in 1952.
Then, if the government had expropriated all the income remaining to those with more than $500,000, it would have realized only $284,000,000. At the 1952 rate of spending, this would support the Federal government one and a half days.

Finally, if the government had taken all income in the $1,000,000 brackets and above, the additional amount would have been $141,000,000. On the basis of a 366-day year in 1952 and a 24-hour day, the remaining income of these very rich people would pay for only 18 hours of Mr. Truman's government.
In considering these figures, several qualifications need to be considered. They do not take account of the taxes other than Federal taxes.
These people could not pay interest on debts. And most important, they would have nothing left to support themselves, their dependents, and all of the worthy causes to which they contribute. For the figures given above refer to Federal taxes alone, and the amounts remaining "after Federal taxes" are "adjusted gross incomes" minus Federal taxes.
It is high time for the politicians who propose to make the well-to-do pay for war and welfare to be confronted with the facts. And more important, it is time to deliver those in the lower incomes from the delusion that they are not the ones who ultimately must pay the costs of a reckless government.
