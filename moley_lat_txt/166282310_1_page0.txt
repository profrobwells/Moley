THE TORIES'
FUTURE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A writer on politics, when
he ventures even remotely
near to a prediction of things
to come, must analyze not
- only figures and facts, but his
own feelings and preferences.
I presume that writers on
business trends do that, too.
In any event, they ought to do
so.
In an American election I
usually write out, the day be-
fore the voting, a list of the
States or Congressional dis-
tricts that my mind tells me
will go my way. Then I write
a list according to my fears
or hunches or what you will.
The two lists I send by mail
to a friend, asking him to
hold the envelope unbroken
until after election. Then it is
opened in the presence of a
witness. Invariably, the list
based on incoherent fear is
nearer right than the one
based on the brain.
That is why I wrote last
week a second column on the
British election. All the pros-
pects seemed very favorable
to the Conservatives. The by-
elections had shown a tre-
mendous drift against Labor.
But two or three factors
gave rise to a feeling rather
than a conviction that the re-
sult might not be so favor-
able to the Conservatives.
While it seemed that the Con-
servatives might win a major-
ity of 50 to 150, and 75 seemed
a fair guess, it seemed well to
figure on a popular vote shift
of 1 or 2%. Hence, I labori-
ously figured each district on
that basis. A 1% shift gave
the Conservatives 321 and
Labor 292. A 2% shift gave
the Conservatives 317 seats.
The lower Conservative figure
was nearly right. This may be
good advice for wishful think-
ers. It would have been good
for a lot of us in 1948.
Apparently the campaign of
fear against Churchill was
effective. The great dread of
another war pervaded the at-
mosphere of Britain. The left-
wing pacifists led by Aneu-
rin Bevan, Michael Foote and
others made the most substan-
tial gains. The middle-of-the-
road people—the Attlee wing
of the Labor Party and the
Liberals—lost the most.
Now we must expect a
deepening break in the Labor
Party. That is what promises
more stability in this Conserv-
ative government than is gen-
erally expected. The Labor
Party will be busy with its
internal squabbles for a while.
The Conservative majority is
not large, but it is as safe as
most Conservative majorities
have been over the last hun-
dred years.
The major problem will be
in foreign affairs. These rela-
tionships are now in more ex-
perienced, more competent
hands.
On the domestic scene, the
Conservative job will be to
improve British living stand-
ards, not as in the last six
years by dividing up less and
less but through renewed
confidence and self-help to
produce and sell more and
more. This can only be done
by moving away from nation-
alization and by slowly reduc-
ing the burden of subsidies
and welfare. It is true that
Conservatives in the campaign
were unable to say that bene-
fits would be reduced. That
is why their appeal has been
called "me-tooism" over here.
But, once in power, they can
move in that direction. And
they will probably move as
fast as they can without en-
dangering their popular sup-
port.
They can and will do a great
deal to reawaken the pride
and assurance of the British
people. It was that pride and
assurance that once accounted
for their great place in the
world.
Relations with the United
States will be improved, for
Churchill is still an American
hero. The ties between the
two countries will be stronger.
That will be good for every-
one concerned.
