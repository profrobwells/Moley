ELECTING
A CONGRESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Both Taft and Eisenhower
Republicans should avoid too
bitter a fight for the nomina-
tion. For without real party
unity after next year's conven-
tion the ticket nominated can-
not hope to win the election.
Truman himself would be no
pushover. Vinson would be
more difficult. That in itself
should be a warning.
But there is another consid-
eration that is a still greater
portent.
Time was when a successful
Presidential candidate swept
in a House and Senate major-
ity on his broad coattails. It
didn't matter much who ran
for those offices, which were
regarded as minor and incon-
sequential. Most of the money
collected was spent electing
the President. Candidates for
the Senate and House were left
to shift for themselves.
In 1936, millions were spent
by the Democratic National
Committee in running up an
unnecessary majority for
Roosevelt. That year I learned
from the Democratic House
campaign chairman that his
committee had received only
$15,000 from the national com-
mittee. Distributed evenly,
that means $35 for each can-
didate.

But even allowing for fur-
ther grants from the national
committee after the time I
learned that from the House
campaign chairman, and al-
lowing for money contributed
directly in the districts, these
candidates went on short ra-
tions. "Never mind," they
were told, "the great white
father will win and all you
children will win in his
wake." He did and they did
—in 1936.
Things have changed a
great deal since then. Coat-
tail riding is no longer the
rule—at least riding on the
Presidential tails. The Presi-
dential candidate is more like-
ly in 1952 to need the multi-
tudinous tails of the Congress-
men. This being true, the Re-
publican Party can do most to-
ward electing a President next
year by giving a great deal of
attention to the election of a
good majority in the House of
Representatives.

A favorite pastime of might-
have-been people is to poke
around in the ruins of a po-
litical defeat hoping to find a
solace and profit. Looking
back at the 1948 holocaust,
they have figured that a shift
of 30,000 votes in Ohio, Illi-
nois and California would
have elected Dewey instead of
Truman. But if 30,000 votes
could have been shifted in
Senate races, the Republicans
would have won four more
Senate seats. And if 30,000
votes had been shifted in
House races, there would have
been 20 more GOP House
members. Then in 1950 there
would have been a chance
to elect majorities in both
houses.
The coattail delusion was
fatal to Republicans in 1948.
There were 24 "critical" or
close House districts in seven
of the States that Dewey car-
ried in that year. Local Demo-
crats aided by the CIO-PAC
really worked to win those
seats. They succeeded in 21
of the 24. Dewey carried those
States, but his victory carried
only three of the critical dis-
tricts. This is fairly good proof
that the coattail strategy was
not working.

In that same election, the
Republicans lost 75 House
seats, and half of them were
in States carried by Dewey.
The CIO-PAC people awak-
ened to this new condition
long before 1948 and shifted
their tactics. They concen-
trated on Congress. Hence,
when they turned out the vote
in districts for their favorite
House candidates, they helped
elect Truman, too.
The lesson to those who are
thinking only of Taft or Eisen-
hower is that even if they
elect their man they may well
deliver him over to a Demo-
cratic Congress, for neither
the tailless jacket of Eisen-
hower nor the tweeds of Taft
can elect a friendly Congress.
