TRUMANITES MOUNT
OFFENSIVE ON DIXIE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At the southern Governors'
conference at Hot Springs,
Ark., on Nov. 11-13, there will
no doubt be plenty of talk on
and off the record to indicate
southern political sentiment
toward the Truman Fair Deal.
Leading up to this have been
Sen. Byrd's speeches in Geor-
gia and Alabama and Gov.
Byrnes' statements last month
at Gatlinburg, Tenn., and his
recent speech in South Caro-
lina. The battle lines seem to
be forming.
Already there are counter-
attacks from the left wing by
Jonathan Daniels, Democratic
National Committeeman from
South Carolina, and Hubert
Humphrey, Senator from Min-
nesota.
Daniels has set himself up
as the authentic Trumanite in
his book, "Man of Independ-
ence," in a magazine article,
and in his early declaration
for Truman in 1952. His at-
tack on Byrnes follows the
true machine line.
Byrnes, he says, has re-
ceived many high honors
from the Democratic Party.
For this, he infers, Byrnes
should be truly grateful, obe-
dient, and regular. That is the
machine line. When a job is
given, you must pay for life,
forsaking all others—in this
case, Byrnes' native State, its
sentiments, his own convic-
tions about the nation's wel-
fare. Nothing but the job
counts.
The South, Daniels goes on,
has received great benefits
from the Democratic Party.
Hence, it must be regular for
all those blessings. The South
will know that its progress
has been due to its own ef-
forts, its resources, and its
own statesmanship. Benefits
are given not by a political
machine but from the na-
tional wealth. Daniels' talk
suggests that the Democratic
Party is something apart from
the South—a Santa Claus fill-
ing the stockings of its chil-
dren.
As to the "ingratitude" of
Byrnes, I happen to know
more of how he attained his
honors than does Daniels, for
I was close to the situation
long before Daniels.
Byrnes was elected to the
Senate by his own personal
efforts, after long and able
service in the House. He was
elected long before Roosevelt's
Presidency and before the New
Deal was born.
No one did more for Roose-
velt in the campaign for Presi-
dent. At my request Byrnes
spent weeks with Roosevelt,
the candidate, and gave tire-
less service. For eight years
he was the most effective aid
that Roosevelt, the President,
had in the Senate.
He labored constantly and
effectively to get Roosevelt's
measures enacted. The Sena-
tors knew this. He was re-
spected by both parties there.
If a poll had been taken of
Democratic Senators, he would
have succeeded John N. Gar-
ner as Vice-President in 1910.
But the President wanted Wal-
lace, and Byrnes buried his
ambition and stepped aside.
To reward his services and
please the Senate, he was ap-
pointed to the Supreme Court.
A year later, the President
induced him to leave the court
to serve the country in war in
the impossible and thankless
job of Economic Stabilizer.
In 1944 Byrnes wanted and
deserved the Vice-Presidency.
He was assured by Roosevelt
that he could have it. He
would have been nominated
except that the city bosses and
their labor allies talked an ill
President into reversing him-
self and agreeing upon Tru-
man. Byrnes was appointed
Secretary of State because it
was doubtful, in view of what
had happened, whether
Byrnes' Democratic friends in
the Senate would have ap-
proved anyone else.
In the reckoning, the Demo-
cratic administration all these
years owed much, much more
to Byrnes than Byrnes owes
to them. It is Byrnes' State
that has honored him, and now
as Governor he is seeking to
protect the rights and inter-
ests of that State and the na-
tion.
The Humphrey attack on
Byrd attempts to read the Vir-
ginia Senator out of the Demo-
cratic Party. The answer to
this can be found by a com-
parison of Byrd's long party
and national service with that
of Humphrey.
