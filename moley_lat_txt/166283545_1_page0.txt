The Hon. Sam Rayburn,
Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives, speaking before
the Southern Governors Con-
ference at Hot Springs, said,
among other things: "If some
of these fellows that have
been talking like, uh, well, I
might say Bob Taft were to
get elected President, and the
people were to think between
November and Jan. 20th that
they were going to put their
threats into performance, mon-
ey being as scary as it is, we
might have a great panic in
that time. I fear that myself."
Rayburn later denied that
he used this exact statement,
but a friend of mine who is
a good reporter checked it on
the tape recording at a local
radio station.
President Truman has had
a lot to say about "scare"
words, but this specimen is
about as "scary" as could be
conceived. It probably repre-
sents the type of campaign
planned for next year-a cam-
paign of fear and general in-
timidation.
To do this is clearly to put
party interest ahead of the na-
tional interest and to intro-
duce elements of instability
which cannot help an econom-
ic system which is struggling
under a heavy tax burden
while it seeks to arm this
country and help many oth-
ers.
It is not clear what the
Speaker means by the
"threats" that Taft has been
making. Perhaps it is his
promise to reduce expendi-
tures.
The Rayburn logic in that
case is that if the present high
rate of spending and inflation
is checked, we shall have idle
factories and idle workmen.
That means that this adminis-
tration is determined to fol-
low its present course of more
and more inflation, more and
more debt. For it is already
clear that expenditures beyond
the present level of taxes must
be paid from borrowed money.
We have for the moment
reached the point of diminish-
ing returns. And the Rayburn
"scare" is that the election of
Taft would mean sudden de-
flation and panic.
There will be other "scares"
as the campaign progresses.
One will be the charge of war-
mongering. We will be told
that a Taft victory will be a
MacArthur victory and that
will mean a war with Russia
in Asia.
That sort of appeal worked
so well against Churchill in
the British election last month
that it will certainly be used
over here. For without that
appeal, the Conservatives
would have won by a greatly
increased majority.
As compared with the Ray-
burn indiscretion, President
Truman's political speech to
the Democratic women was
highly restrained and almost
dignified. But Truman, more
politically astute than Ray-
burn, believes in saving his
"scares" for a more opportuna-
time. They will appear, how-
ever, when real political hos-
tilities begin. Rayburn was
merely offside.
