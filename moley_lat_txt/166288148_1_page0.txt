NOT ALL OF THE BOYS
COME FROM MISSOURI
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The embarrassment of two
Indiana boys, Frank McKin-
ney and Frank McHale, must
give President Truman at least
one bit of relief. It shows
that not all of the rising and
prosperous young men of these
days come from Missouri. In-
deed, the problem of ethical
standards seems to be extend-
ing to all parts of the republic.
In the cases of the two gen-
tlemen from Indiana there
seems to be no question of a
violation of the law. There is
a difference of opinion on the
issue of ethics, with McKinney
sustaining the argument on
his side. There has apparent-
ly been no opinion rendered by
McHale.
It should be understood that
these gentlemen were not pub-
lic officials when they received
the fabulous profit on their
Empire Tractor Co. stock.
Neither is a public official
now. McKinney was not even
an officer or member of the
Democratic National Commit-
tee when the incident oc-
curred.

Whether McKinney had any
part or influences in the trans-
actions of Frank Cohen of the
Empire Ordnance and Empire
Tractor Cos. is not shown. So
for the moment let us put aside
the propriety or ethics of
McKinney's activities prior to
his accession to the chairman-
ship of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee.
The case of McHale is quite
different. He was not a public
official, but since 1937 he has
been an Indiana member of
the Democratic National Com-
mittee. In his biography in
"Who's Who" he appears to
have been a director in the
Empire Ordnance Corp. The
Empire Ordnance Corp. came
under the control of Frank
Cohen in 1940. In 1946, accord-
ing to the New York Herald
Tribune, Cohen organized the
Empire Tractor Co. "out of the
remnants of the Empire Ord-
nance." The Empire Tractor
Co. apparently had only two
customers—the governments
of Argentina and the United
States.
The McHale connection with
Empire Tractor is thus de-
scribed in the New York Times:
"Records of the Court of
Claims disclosed, that Mr.
McHale, a Democratic National
Committeeman, had filed suit
for a $93,500 legal fee he said
was due him from the com-
pany. The fee, he maintained,
was included in assets of the
company seized by the Federal
government as part of excess
profits made by the company.
★
"Mr. McHale said he had
been voted a 10% fee for his
legal aid in winning a $935,000
award from the government
in a contract settlement case.
Mr. McHale said he had invest-
ed money in Empire Ordnance,
but that all his services to the
firm were legal."
According to this account,
therefore, McHale, a member
of the Democratic National
Committee, represented a com-
pany in its dealings with the
U.S. government.
Early in his administration,
President Roosevelt declared
that no officer or member of
the Democratic National Com-
mittee should engage in the
practice of law before govern-
ment departments. As a re-
sult, three members of the
national committee resigned in
order to retain the right to
continue their profession in
Washington.
The McHale affair shows
how completely this early
Roosevelt rule has been aban-
doned. If President Truman
is as anxious as he seems to
be to walk in his predecessor's
footsteps, he might activate the
Roosevelt rule. If so, there
would probably be others be-
sides McHale who would be
affected.
Here is one spot where
ethical standards might be re-
habilitated.
