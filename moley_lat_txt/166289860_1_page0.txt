Have We Changed—or
Does Truman Libel Us?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Harry S. Truman never offered a better exposition of the
crass materialism that guides
him and his minions and
henchmen than his harangue
to the Americans for Democratic Action last week. A careful
examination of that speech
will make clear not only our
degraded leadership but the
explanation of the spiritual
and moral decline that afflicts
a majority of this nation.
In mentioning morality, I
am not referring to the hoodlum’s code that guides the
people who have been caught
exploiting influence for profit
or sacking the public till or
taking bribes. That sort of
thing is only the scum on the
surface of a stagnant, noxious
sea of materialism and expediency.
The fact that these Presidential discourses are taken
so lightly by those who disagree and so enthusiastically
by those who follow Truman’s
leadership is itself a reflection
upon all of us. Apparently, we
are so imbued with the conviction that nothing succeeds
like success that the fact of
Truman’s victory in 1948 still
hangs over us.

We hear him utter this
worse-than-nonsense and know
it for what it is. But the fact
that it gets him votes brings
us not quite to approve it, but
to recognize it as a sort of occult wisdom. For altogether
too many of us have entered
that decadent stage where we
have ceased to believe in the
power of an ideal, in the virtue of standing alone or in the
ascendancy of right over majority might.
The Truman speech in substance said that his party is
invincible because it has given
more material things to more
people. He sees himself as the
champion of the many taking
from the few. In the steel dispute all is either black or
white to him. The workers are
right; the companies are
wrong.

In his reference to the tidelands Truman sinks to the
false argument that it is an issue between “the oil lobby”
and “the People.” It is, in fact,
as he might know, an issue
in which oil companies are
merely bystanders. The real
issue is between the few
States that have tidelands
oil and the many that do not.
Reduced to raw reality, the
Truman administration, like
its predecessor, is simply trying
to take something away
from the smaller body of people who live in the tidelands
States and give it to the larger
body of people who do not
live there. It is a clear example of gross expropriation.

Then Truman tells his listeners all about how to win
elections. He reminds them
over and over that he is an
expert at that. In short, we
hear volumes about how to win. Not a word about how to
be right.
It is a national tragedy that
for these many years we have
had no reminders from the
White House of the great
nonmaterial American values.
If you would realize the tragedy of this leadership, go
back to last Sunday’s Times
and read that Truman speech.
Then remind yourself that the
man who uttered it occupies
the office that gave honor to
Washington, Jefferson and
Lincoln. Lay it down beside
a Grover Cleveland message
or a major Woodrow Wilson
address.
Think of Truman, and then
consider this prescription for
a President laid down by
Woodrow Wilson five years
before he attained that office.
He said that the President
should be “a man who will be,
and who will seem to the
country in some sort of an
embodiment of the character
and purpose it wishes its government to have.”
Either we have lost our way
in pursuit of material ends
or our President grossly misrepresents us.
