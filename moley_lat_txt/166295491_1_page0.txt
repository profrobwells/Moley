TAX RELIEF
IN BRITAIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Angry and hard-pressed tax-
payers in this March season,
as well as Republicans look-
ing for a 1952 issue, might
well examine the new Con-
servative budget in Britain.
Among the many changes in
financial planning introduced
by Chancellor of the Excheq-
uer R. A. Butler are some very
interesting and sensible alter-
ations in the tax rates on low-
er incomes.
He proposes to lighten the
burden on some income groups
in a way designed to produce
more work and more produc-
tion. The principle behind
this is that the only way to
ultimate recovery is to pro-
duce more goods, and more
goods cannot be produced
without more hours of work
and harder work.
The Butler proposal was ap-
parently received with enthusi-
asm by both Labor and Con-
servative members of the
House of Commons. It is an in-
dication of the strange myopia
of Labor that it failed to grasp
this idea while it was in office.
Instead, the Labor govern-
ment placed all emphasis on
soaking the rich and on hand-
outs to the poor.
The same myopia afflicts
labor leaders in the United
States. Over the past two or
three years I have heard econ-
omists employed by labor
unions argue continually that
there is plenty of money in
the higher brackets for new
taxes and that new taxes are
essential.
On the other hand, Ralph
Robey, chief economist for
the National Association of
Manufacturers, has argued for
a year or more that incentives
such as this British plan are
essential to pay the burdens
of government through more
production.
Thus, conservatives on both
sides of the ocean realize that
the true interests of labor are
in more production and not
in a further redistribution of
existing wealth.
Butler's plan is to increase
the exemption on income in
the lower brackets and to
scale the increases in rates
from the low to the high in-
comes more gradually. There
is substantially, no change in
the higher income rates. The
real effect of this will be to
encourage workers to put in
overtime and to earn more
money without running their
income into higher brackets
and more taxes.
Essentially, this means that
workers are told: "If you will
work more overtime, you will
make more money and the
government will not take it
away in taxation."
The new plan will exempt
about 2,000,000 workers from
income taxes. It will also re-
duce the government's income
by $500,000,000 this year and
by somewhat more next year.
But against this loss to the
government there will be a
very considerably increased
national production and more
to export, especially in such
lines as coal.
The worker will pay more
for some things because the
government will have less for
benefits, but he will have con-
siderably more to spend.
There is no reason why the
United States should not also
recognize the hard fact that
there is such a thing as dimin-
ishing returns in taxation and
that we have reached, if not
passed, that point.
