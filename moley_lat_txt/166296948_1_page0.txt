THE TORIES
SHOW US
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The new Conservative gov-
ernment in Britain will offer
its annual budget on March 4,
which is an extraordinarily
early date for that event. By
tradition it has been offered in
April, but, the unusual eco-
nomic conditions that confront
the nation make it necessary
that what must be done should
be done soon.
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Richard Austen Butler's re-
cent preview of economic pol-
icies makes it certain that the
financial program offered will
be a shining example of what
a government can do when it
really sets out to put its house
in order. The economies it
proposes should be an inspira-
tion and a talking point for
that small band of Senators
and Representatives in Wash-
ington who want to stop
spending over here.
★
The 'cutbacks proposed by
Butler are of two kinds—a re-
duction of civilian use of ar-
ticles needed to reduce im-
ports and increase exports, and
a reduction of spending by the
government itself. The two
are related, Butler says, de-
spite the claim of some econ-
omists that they are not.
"Our fundamental task," he
said, "is to increase the re-
sources available for export,
and this cannot be done unless
we are willing to release them
from the other calls made up-
on them."
Then he added something
that applies just as well to our
own problem: "Constantly in-
creasing taxation has required
the maintenance of absolute
levels of tax so high as se-
riously to check incentives to
work and to enterprise." In
short, the more we tax, the
less we produce.
★
Some of the cuts he proposes
are refreshing departures from
Socialist practices. The first
is one we might emulate. It
is a big cut in information
services. Public relations serv-
ices in the government will be
cut 10%. Films and other
propaganda for use by the
government overseas will be
eliminated. If Congress had
the courage, it would do like-
wise in Washington. Hundreds
of handout men, ghost writ-
ers and other publicity people
should be lopped off the Fed-
eral budget and turned back to
civilian life.
Expenditures for education
in Britain will be reduced
without, however, cutting
teachers' salaries.
Best of all is a beginning of
an effort to cut down the
abuses encouraged by social-
ized medicine. When this ab-
surd system was started three
and a half years ago, its cost
was estimated at £200,000,000
a year. The cost mounted
year after year until it now
threatens to upset the entire
financial structure of the gov-
ernment. Butler "hopes" to
keep it under £400,000,000 a
year.
★
As a modest beginning, a
charge of 1s will be made on
prescriptions. Under the orig-
inal plan, drugs were free.
The government thus encour-
aged not only the patrons of
drugstores but the proprietors
themselves to run costs as
high as possible. Dental care
will henceforth be paid for up
to £1.
Finally, the civil service will
be reduced by 10,000 in the
next six months, with more
cuts coming later.
Britain is showing us that
the way to economize is to
economize.
