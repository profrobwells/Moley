MISLEADING
COMPASS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

I have not brushed up on
the life of Columbus lately.
but I remember the story of
his first crossing in my school
history. It said that one of
the things that frightened his
crew was the fact that the
compass no longer pointed di-
rectly north. From this they
drew the conclusion that their
eccentric commander had
taken them into strange re-
gions where old and firm stand-
ards of measurement no long-
er prevailed and where life
was subject to unforeseeable
caprice. They counseled
among themselves, and there
was strong sentiment for
throwing Columbus overboard.

Our national measure of
material value is the dollar.
In terms of the dollar we are
told how we are doing, where
we are, whither we are going,
and where we have been. The
tides and winds of inflation
have carried us, however, into
a region where the dollar sign
means little in terms of the
past and practically nothing
in terms of the future.

Let us take as an example
government reports of the ag-
gregate savings of our people.
The Department of Commerce
estimated the 1950 personal
income of all individuals to
be $221,721,000,000. In dollars,
this was 30.7% higher than
1915.

But if we apply the con-
sumers' price index, the 1950
income was in reality 6.6%
less than 1915. But there were
more people to divide the pie
in 1950. So on a per capita
basis, the 1950 combined in-
come of individuals was 11.6%
less than 1915.

The same apparent increase
but real shrinkage is true of
figures of savings. The De-
partment of Commerce tells us
that the people of the United
States in 1950 saved $10,693,-
000,000 out of their income.
That sounds fine.

But let us see what
happened to their total
savings. They had in all
forms of savings on Jan. 1,
1950, $217,076,000,000. But dur-
ing 1950 the consumers' price
index showed a decline in
purchasing power of 6.3%.
Hence, $13,676,000,000 of what
people had saved before 1950
melted away. So if they add-
ed $10,693,000,000 that year,
they ended up the year $2,983,-
000,000 poorer in savings.

We now also have Depart-
ment of Commerce figures for
the first six months of 1951.
The savings of the American
people in that period were
$7,600,000,000. But the total
money saved on Jan. 1, 1951,
decreased $9,000,000,000. So
during those six months the
American people grew poorer
in savings by $1,400,000,000.

Two lessons should be
drawn from these figures. The
first is to sprinkle plenty of
salt on the figures you hear
from Messrs. Truman, Bark-
ley and others next year when
they tell you, as they will,
how much better off you are.
The second is more funda-
mental. In this period of in-
flation, the meaning of a dol-
lar is so uncertain that our
government statistics, assem-
bled at great cost, are losing
all meaning. Perhaps they
will have to issue two sets of
figures, just as street signs in
some places are in two lan-
guages. One figure for dollars;
another for value.

At the moment few of us
know where we are going or
how or whence.
