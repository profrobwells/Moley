REUTHER'S
FALLACY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The demand of the United
Steelworkers' Union for a guar-
anteed annual wage raises
once more all the problems
connected with that bit of Uto-
pianism. Walter Reuther at a
recent CIO convention put it
this way:
"As long as the workers of
America pay for unemploy-
ment you are going to have
unemployment in this country.
But once you make the em-
ployer pay for unemployment
through a guaranteed annual
wage then unemployment will
disappear because industry
will find the means of rejig-
gering its production schedule
so as to provide work for em-
ployees instead of paying them
for lying idle."
★
This statement, as well as
the philosophy behind it, needs
a bit of analysis. To begin
with, the penalty for unem-
ployment falls upon all con-
cerned, not just the workers
involved. The implication in
the Reuther statement is that
nobody pays but the worker.
He also assumes that an in-
dustry managed so that work-
ers can be guaranteed annual
wages will in reality pay work-
ers as much in the long run
as an industry which is sub-
ject to the normal processes of
supply and demand. The fact
is that if all industry were run
so that everyone could be safe
it would run at a constant but
low rate of activity. The real
issue is not any annual wage
but what size an annual wage
must be if it can be guaran-
teed.
Behind all this is the famil-
iar Socialistic philosophy for
which Reuther is a consistent
spokesman. When I was in
England last year I asked
Aneurin Bevan, the most ex-
treme Socialist in the Labor
Party, what American labor
leaders he preferred and with-
out any hesitation he an-
swered, "The Reuther broth-
ers."
★
Surely the collection of nos-
trums supported by Walter
Reuther over the past dozen
years justifies Bevan's opinion.
Reuther, however, cannot
present himself as an authen-
tic Socialist. For the authentic
Socialist is a philosopher who
must in his dialectic eliminate
capitalism completely. This
cannot be argued by a politi-
cian like Reuther.
He must as a demagogue
pretend that capitalism and So-
cialism can live together, the
former as a breadwinner, the
latter as what Yankees used to
call a "help cat." In short, he
must assert that workers can
eat the cake of capitalism and
keep it, too.
But a bit of common sense
shows how futile this would
be in the case of the annual
wage. If a company should
guarantee an annual wage, its
contractual obligation respect-
ing wages would be preferen-
tial in case of bankruptcy.
That is the law. Hence, when-
ever such an undertaking is
assumed the credit of the com-
pany is limited. If a slump
came the company could not
get materials except under
strict conditions; perhaps it
would have to pay cash. This
would react against the capac-
ity of the company to keep
its guarantee. In short, the
moment you fix firmly one seg-
ment in a capitalistic or free
economy you affect the opera-
tion of the whole structure.
We cannot long remain just a
little bit Socialist.
