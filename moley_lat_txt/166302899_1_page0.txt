Supporters of Eisenhower
have an asset in their candi
date's popularity which may
outweigh every liability. But
the liabilities must not be un
derestimated, for they are
very great.
The most important of these
and the highest hurdle in the
race before the general is the
problem of living up to ex
pectations. Ever since the suc-
cessful termination of the war
in Europe, the commander
of that campaign has been en-
larged in American minds to
the proportions of a very
great national hero. As such,
he has been portrayed as a
means of solving every na-
tional problem and of remov-
ing every personal anxiety.
Are we to be afflicted with
another war? Ike can lead us
to peace. Are taxes too high?
Ike can get more for your
money. Are we governed by
incompetent and corrupt peo-
ple? Ike knows how to choose
smart men.
Businessmen who want the
trend to Socialism stopped be-
lieve that Eisenhower will fol-
low their judgment in shap-
ing national policies. On the
other hand, advocates of the
welfare state believe that he
speaks their language.

Thus, Eisenhower enjoys
unparalleled prestige coupled
with an almost complete lack
of commitments. This is a
precious but highly perish-
able value.
Someday the silence must
be broken and on that day the
unanimity of this acclaim will
also be broken. That day, it
now appears, will be when
and if Eisenhower is nomi-
nated. Prior to his recent
statement, it seemed as if that
day might be in January or
February. But in any case,
that critical time must be
faced.
If in facing it the general
seeks to retain all of his pres-
ent support he will most cer-
tainly fail to retain any of it.
For such an effort would be
regarded as a me-too appeal,
which would probably keep
millions of potential voters at
home, and if his opponent is
some Democrat other than
Truman it would lose him the
election.
If Truman is the Demo-
cratic candidate, the South will
certainly bolt, and any Repub-
lican, even a greatly deflated
Eisenhower, would win.
The dreadful ordeal that a
candidate meets when he
makes known his views after
a long silence was well shown
in the case of Charles Evans
Hughes in 1916.

It has always been regard-
ed as a truism that Hughes
lost that election because of
his failure to carry California.
It is true that the vote of that
State was finally decisive. But
after refreshing my memory
by a reading of Merlo Pusey's
excellent biography of Hughes,
it seems to me that he lost the
election in his first speech aft-
er the nomination—his accept-
ance in July at Carnegie Hall.
At that time, expectations
had been whipped up to such
a height that a combination of
Webster, Pericles and Demos-
thenes would have failed. In
short, the speech was a flop.
It satisfied no one, while it
tried to satisfy everyone.
This was also true of Wen-
dell Willkie's acceptance
speech in 1940. Edward J.
Flynn, who was Democratic
national chairman in that
year, has said that until that
speech, Willkie was supreme.
After it, he was lost.
This is a matter that should
concern the Eisenhower sup-
porters very deeply. For they
must not only nominate their
man but elect him.
