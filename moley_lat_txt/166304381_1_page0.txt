REWARD FOR
WORKERS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
James F. Lincoln, president
of the Lincoln Electric Co. of
Cleveland, has proved to
American management, labor
and a widening circle of the
general public what no wel-
fare state, however benign,
can ever demonstrate.
He has shown by the accu-
rate test of experience that labor
can have high compensation
without passing the cost on
in high prices, and thus without
promoting inflation. The
Truman administration, with
the collaboration of a number
of ruthless labor leaders
and submissive corporations,
is demonstrating the opposite.
The difference lies in a will
to do, in harmony between
workers and management,
and in the personality of Lin-
coln himself.

We have been hearing a
great deal about the Lincoln
incentive plan. Lincoln him-
self has been quite a missionary
for his idea. But the whole
plan and the philosophy behind
it have not been clearly
grasped, at least by this
writer. Now, however, Lincoln
himself has written a readable
book, "Incentive Management,"
which explains his
ideas at length and by irrefutable
statistics proves their
value. This book should be
required reading of industrial
managers everywhere.
The specific incentives by
which Lincoln has increased
the efficiency of his workers
are all more or less conventional.
Piecework, carefully
divested of old objectionable
features of such a method of
compensation, is one Lincoln
method. Another is employee
stock ownership, which is not
at all new. Most important is
a bonus system. This, according
to Cleveland observers
who have studied the system
at firsthand, is the major factor
in the system.

Each person working for
the company receives an annual
bonus or, as Lincoln calls
it, a reward. This is not a gift,
nor is it profit sharing. It is a
reward to the worker, according
to Lincoln, "for all the
things he does that are of
help" minus all that he does
not do as well as others. Ratings
are made for each employee
three times a year.
In 16 years this reward has
ranged in amount from 20 to
128% of the wages paid. The
average worker who has been
with the company those 16
years has received $40,000 in
rewards.
The book presents a tabular
statement of the total compensation
of Lincoln employees
for each of the 16 years,
compared with that received
by employees of six other major
corporations which have
paid well. The average compensation
of Lincoln employees
in 1950 was $7701. That of
General Electric, for example,
was $3705. Other large corporations
ranged from $3280
to $4109.

It hardly needs to be added
that the payment of this truly
immense compensation was
made possible by great efficiency
in production. Lincoln
had no work stoppages
through labor trouble, low
turnover, high productivity
per man-hour and many other
advantages. The price of the
company's products has declined.
All this Lincoln attributes to
the development of teamwork,
fine relations among the
employees and between management
and labor. In great
detail throughout the book,
sometimes it seems in repetitious
detail, Lincoln stresses
the spirit without which any
device will fail.
It is the sort of goodwill
story that hard-bitten people
usually greet with cynical
doubt. But hard-bitten people
who have seen the Lincoln
system at work report that
really and honestly the darned
thing works.
