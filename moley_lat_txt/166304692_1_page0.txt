SEAWAY
FINANCE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The long debate over the
St. Lawrence Seaway project
has at last opened up several
possible ways in which it can
be built without placing an-
other burden on the suffering
taxpayers of the nation.
The latest and possibly the
best is a proposal by Sen.
Taft, in which he is joined by
some of his colleagues, including
several who disagree with
him politically such as Her-
bert Lehman and Wayne
Morse. This proposal is that
the cost of the seaway be met
by the issuance of bonds by
some sort of seaway authority,
possibly with a government
guarantee.
★
On the other hand, a great
many sound people have been
saying that the Canadian gov-
ernment should be permitted
or induced to build the project.
In that case, the project
itself would be on the Cana-
dian side of the boundary. But
considering the close relations
between the two countries,
this would not be a disadvan-
tage to us.
A third proposal is that the
State of New York undertake
the job through some sort of
power authority created by its
Legislature.
In at least the first two of
these plans, the money neces-
sary for the construction
would be raised from private
sources, and probably from
investors in the United States.
If New York State should
build the project, the money
would also probably come
from private sources through
bonds issued by the New York
Power Authority.
If the Taft proposal should
be adopted, the question of a
government guarantee of the
bonds would immediately
arise. Some bankers have al-
ready expressed the view that
they could not sell the bonds
without such a guarantee. If
Canada were to take over the
job, the Canadian government
might have to guarantee the
bonds.
★
If a guarantee proved to be
necessary, however, the prob-
lem for Congress would be to
determine beyond question
whether the project really
would pay for itself and if so
over what period of years. The
interests concerned with the
shipping of iron ore from the
newly found Quebec-Labrador
resources say that this traffic
would go a long way to pay for
the seaway. That and other
points should be carefully
measured before a guarantee
is given.
For with the Federal budget
far out of balance and the na-
tional debt increasing yearly,
it cannot be sound policy to
promote inflationary borrow-
ing for every seemingly
worthy cause. Nor can the gov-
ernment obligate itself by
guarantees to pay at some
future time money that may
not be easy to get.
★
Gov. Driscoll of New Jersey,
at the Governors' conference
two years ago, took a firm
stand against some of the
western Governors who were
seeking Federal money for
their project. "If," said Dris-
coll, "these projects will pay
for themselves, the bond mar-
ket is the place for the test."
Nor should the St. Lawrence
project be regarded as a war
necessity. That cannot be
proved. The defense effort is
now being used to justify all
sorts of things that have failed
on other grounds.
If the seaway is to be built,
it should be justified as a
sound, self-liquidating, peace-
time project.
