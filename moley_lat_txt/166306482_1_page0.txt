NOT ONLY
WAGES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the present controversy
between Murray's steel union
and the industry, most attention
is being directed at the
demand for an 18Â½-cent-per-
hour pay rise. But it should
not be overlooked that the so-
called fringe benefits demand-
ed by the union actually mean
more than the wage increase
in compensation, in the cost of
production and in inflationary
dangers.

Fringe benefits include such
items as payments to pension
funds, life insurance, sickness
care and other welfare items.
Demands for these have be-
come standard union practice
ever since John L. Lewis saw
the immense advantages in
this sort of compensation.
The attractiveness of these
benefits as items for bargain-
ing are numerous; in the first
place, they help labor leaders
to escape public resentment
against wage demands. At
long last the public realizes
that every wage increase ac-
celerates the rate of inflation,
makes it harder to meet living
costs and eats into the real
value of savings. But fringe
benefits have the same effect,
although the public seems to
be unaware of it.

These fringe benefits are
progressively more advanta-
geous to the worker because
they are not taxable. Not even
the income earned on the ac-
cumulation of reserves to meet
future payments is taxable.
Thus, a dollar of benefit is
more net gain to the worker
and more costly to the public
than a dollar in wages. For
if a dollar paid out in wages
or salaries returns to the
government 25 cents in tax,
the public is saved that
amount because taxes on other
incomes will not be so high.
Another advantage to union
leaders in fringe benefits is
that they do not loom up in
the Department of Commerce
estimates of average annual
pay. The annual value of these
benefits to the employee is
very difficult to fix; hence, the
union leader can make a more
plausible case to the public.
The Truman administration
also loves these fringe bene-
fits because despite the pay-
ments it can still claim that
it is holding the line on wages.

Finally, fringe benefits have
an emotional appeal, because
they represent some form of
security for the old and the
helpless.
Under modern, economic
conditions, a payment by a
private employer to a private
employee is no longer a pure-
ly private matter, for through
definite but indirect channels
the cost must be met by the
general public. The meeting
of this cost is as inexorable as
taxation. If U.S. Steel must
pay out a dollar in wages and
benefits, its costs go up and
the burden will be shifted to
everyone who uses its product
and in turn to everyone who
uses a product made of that
product. This controversy is
no private fight. It is a mat-
ter of grave public concern.
In my next column I shall
present some figures indi-
cating the cost of fringe bene-
fits in the past two or three
years.
