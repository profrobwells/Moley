Guaranteed Annual Wage
Demands Cut in' Payrolls
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The demand of the CIO
Steelworkers' Union for a
guaranteed annual wage has
properly been described as
"a plan to guarantee unem-
ployment and to make unem-
ployment permanent."
This guaranteed wage idea is
a dream that has been haunt-
ing the minds of self-styled
liberals for a generation. It
now becomes a tool for the use
of politicians. But it still can-
not, when applied to an in-
dustry like steel, survive
either the test of history or
of simple economics.
Like so many of the aspira-
tions of well-meaning people,
this idea is hopelessly en-
tangled in the muck of seman-
tics. It is largely an exercise
in word juggling. It does not
mean what the words mean
that are used to describe it.
And the expression "guaran-
teed annual wage" means
various things to various
people.
A guaranteed wage plan
may be voluntary or compul-
sory. Most of the plans in the
past have been voluntary and
at the outset partial and high-
ly experimental. In almost all
cases they have been hedged
about with so many condi-
tions and qualifications that
they could hardly be called
"guaranteed" or "annual" at
all.
â˜…
Most such plans have ulti-
mately been abandoned. And
no industry even remotely re-
sembling that of steelmak-
ing has attempted a guaran-
tee. Most of the experiments
tried in the 1920s were in
consumer goods industries or
merchandising.
It is possible for the man-
agement of a company, in full
and sympathetic co-operation
with its employees, to attempt
to plan its work so as to
achieve a maximum of stabil-
ity. In fact, that is what all
intelligent managements try
to do. This idea of a guaran-
teed annual wage is another
case of confusing objectives
with next steps. For when
we try to reach the ultimate
in the next step, we lose
both the ultimate and the
present.
The present demand of the
steel union, like the one it
made in 1944, is not really a
demand for a guaranteed an-
nual wage. It is a demand for
a guarantee of payments every
week for 32 hours of work. In
almost every part of steel
manufacturing it would be
absurd to work parts of a
week. People either work all
week or not at all.
When a mill is put into
operation, it runs continuously.
This demand for a minimum
each week really amounts to a
demand for full operation
throughout every week of
every year of the contract in
every job in every mill in every
company.
This is a risk that the in-
dustry cannot take, as can be
shown by a consideration of
the sources it has from which
to pay people for working or
for not working.

The following are figures for
the U.S. Steel Corp. for the
first nine months in 1951. They
are in round numbers.
The corporation received
$2,592,000,000 for what it sold.
It paid out for employment
$1,017,000,000; for products and
services used, $962,000,000; for
wear and exhaustion of its
plant facilities, $122,000,000; for
interest and services on long-
term debt, $3,000,000; for State,
local and miscellaneous taxes,
$59,000,000; for Federal taxes
(estimated), $295,000,000. The
total of these costs was $2,458-
000,000, which left net of
$134,000,000.
It is clear from this that
if an annual wage is to be pro-
vided in the amount demanded
by the union, a reserve will
have to be set up out of the
above items. If the entire in-
come item should be used and
the millions of stockholders
should be denied any return,
the amount provided could
not guarantee against even a
moderate drop in orders. That
contingency cannot therefore
adequately be provided against
by any of the items listed
above, except the employment
item or the products and serv-
ices item. If these are re-
duced, employment must be
cut.
No such industry can pos-
sibly make such a guarantee
except on the basis of a mini-
mum estimate of orders. And
that would mean canceling
out of tens of thousands of
jobs. It is a perfect prescrip-
tion for unemployment.
