SEN. TAFT'S HANDLERS
HAVE FAILED HIM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This is written after a few
days in Ohio and Michigan.
For the most part, I was in
Taft country and talked with
Taft people. It hardly needs to
be said that they were disap-
pointed in the results in New
Hampshire and Minnesota.
What does need to be said,
however, is what most of the
informed ones offered as par-
tial reason for the New Hamp-
shire disaster. In brief, the
blame attaches to the strat-
egy employed by Taft manag-
ers, none to Taft himself. His
efforts were heroic. Without
them, his showing would have
been deplorable.
*
The most plausible story I
heard was from a man who
spent some time vacationing
in New Hampshire. He said
that at that time he was told
by a native of the State that
Taft managers were not mak-
ing their connections with peo-
ple who might help a candidate
most. He said further that,
while the fact would now be
indignantly denied, at that
time there was a chance to
bring some of the political
leaders of the State to the sup-
port of Taft. Instead of en-
deavoring to do so, however,
Taft's "supposed political sup-
porters were putting them-
selves in a position of appar-
ent obligation to persons not
acceptable to the regular Re-
publican organization in New
Hampshire, from Gov. Adams
down to the town and ward
level.
In a big State like Ohio or
Illinois it is possible to find
many distinct and semi-inde-
pendent organizations in vari-
ous parts of the State. It is
possible to offend one without
losing all. But in New Hamp-
shire there is room for only
one organization. To win
against organization candi-
dates in a primary in which
only a minority of the eligible
voters participate, the organi-
zation must be defeated with-
in itself.
This was the miracle at-
tempted by the Taft manage-
ment. The result was not a
miracle, as some Eisenhower
people claim. It was the nor-
mal course of events. The or-
ganization called upon its peo-
ple and upon those who owed
it allegiance to do their utmost
for Eisenhower. People who
were outside the State on busi-
ness or pleasure were even
called back. One man came all
the way from Miami to attend
his town meeting.
The result was thus only in
part due to the drawing power
of the Eisenhower name. To
say anything else would be
grossly unfair to Gov. Adams
and his organization. The re-
markable "drawing power"
was in the Taft name. Because
surely a great many more than
the 10,723 margin of votes be-
tween the two candidates were
won by the organization and
the organization alone.
The irony is that the Taft
campaign is supposed to be di-
rected by astute professional
managers.
From another man in Ohio
comes this comment: "I am
somewhat fearful that the des-
perate 'desire to win' is having
the same baleful effect on
many that it has had since
early 1940. I have lived with
that hysteria so long I guess I
am personally getting used to
it, but I can see telltale signs,
which I do not like, among my
friends who are naturally pro-
Taft.
*
"It seems incredible that a
few incompetent men should
have such an adverse effect on
a man of such surpassing abil-
ity and, in this case, upon the
welfare of the country."
All this carries my thoughts
back to 1948 when Dewey took
the prize away from Taft.
Dewey, then as now, was not
popular outside of New York.
But he had the shrewdest
managers. Taft was not so
well served. Dewey won the
nomination.
Results in Illinois and Wis-
consin will probably be differ-
ent because in the former
State Sen. Dirksen is in charge
and in the latter Tom Cole-
man. Both know their way
around.
But, over all, if either Taft or
Eisenhower carries off the
nomination it will be because
of respect and admiration for
the man rather than the skill
of his management.
