COMEDY OF ERRORS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is very great danger
that what promised to be the
dramatic pattern of a great
contest for the Republican
nomination may dissolve into
a comedy of errors.
The action of Taft support-
ers in Texas in seizing control
of the State convention was
not only wrong but stupid. It
has given Taft's opposition ti-
tle to a charge of fraud. This
column has before this noted
other blunders of Taft's man-
agers, notably in New Hamp-
shire and New Jersey.
The Eisenhower manage-
ment's mistakes are yet to
come, but there will be plenty
of time for them.
Now the first of them ap-
pears, and, as the late Mayor
LaGuardia used to say of his
own mistakes, it is a "honey."
The invitation to Republican
delegates to visit Gen. Eisen-
hower at the expense of pro-
Eisenhower committees is an
ominous warning of greater
mistakes to come.
It probably seemed to the
people who offered this invita-
tion that it was a harmless
gesture that might help illu-
minate Eisenhower's views
and enable the delegates to
have a closer look at the can-
didate. But apparently the peo-
ple who launched this project
failed to observe an elemen-
tary rule in politics. That rule
is, before you speak or act,
to think of the worst thing
the opposition can do or say
in reply.

The first obvious objection
to providing for the expenses
of delegates for such a pur-
pose is that it is "a junket for
the jurors." The parallel is
thus suggested of what a judge
would say if one of the parties
to a lawsuit should entertain
the jury before the trial is
over. No doubt in such a case
the judge would sack the jury
and fine the offending party.
Another objection is that
this enables the Taft manage-
ment to emphasize the charge
that vast money interests are
behind the Eisenhower cam-
paign. John Hamilton says
that the funds for these ex-
penses are "scooped from the
deep vaults of Wall Street in-
ternational bankers."
Of course, a great many
Wall Street bankers are sup-
porting Eisenhower. Their po-
litical sagacity has from time
immemorial been proved to
be of a very inferior order.
Once more, they may be a
millstone around the neck of a
perfectly good candidate.
It would seem to me that the
greatest peril facing both Taft
and Eisenhower is the mis-
guided zeal of their adherents.
