Northern Republicans and
conservative Democrats, now
busy picking candidates, should
realize that, regardless of their
choice, the next election is likely
to be decided in the South.
And in that decision Texas will
play the major role.
Gov. Allen Shivers, who succeeded
to his present post at
the death of Gov. Jester two
years ago, has proved to be a
strong and popular executive.
He has energetically opposed
the Truman administration in
the tidelands cases, in the issue
of segregation in the University
of Texas Law School
and in other vital concerns.
As a result, he has come to be
regarded as the potential leader
of a southern revolt against
President Truman. Gov.
Byrnes of South Carolina has
indicated that Gov. Shivers is
his choice for that role.
*
At the moment Gov. Shivers
is making up his mind about
whether to run for re-election
or to oppose Tom Connally for
his seat in the Senate. His decision
will come soon. If he
decides to run for re-election,
Price Daniel, his friend and
the Attorney General of the
State, will oppose Sen. Connally.
If he prefers the Senate, the
Attorney General will
seek the Governorship.
It is believed by many good
observers that the aging Senator
will decide not to run. His
defeat by either the Governor
or the Attorney General is fairly
certain because he has followed
the Truman line altogether
too consistently to be
popular in Texas.
Gov. Shivers is firmly in control
of the Democratic organization
in Texas. Moreover, he enjoys
the support of a very
powerful and well-integrated
group of conservatives who
are irrevocably opposed to the
Truman policies.
These conservatives have
succeeded in bringing about a
comprehensive amendment of
the election laws which will
make it possible to control the
State convention and to send
an uninstructed but really
anti-Truman delegation to the
national convention in July.

A probability is that if the
President is renominated it
will be possible to run and
elect a slate of electors who
will join other southern electors
in making the re-election
of President Truman utterly
impossible. It should be remembered
that four States
withheld their votes in 1948.
To add Texas to that group
would probably decide the
election.
Thus, Texas, after many
years of following the party
line, is now definitely debatable
territory. The State is not
likely to go Republican unless
Gen. Eisenhower is the candidate.
But it can be assumed
that President Truman is quite
unlikely to carry it again.
Moreover, if Chief Justice
Vinson should be substituted
for President Truman it is
very doubtful that he could
carry Texas. For the Chief
Justice is decidedly unpopular
there because of his stand in
the tidelands and his opinion
in the law school case.
In this picture Gov. Shivers
emerges as a very significant
figure.
