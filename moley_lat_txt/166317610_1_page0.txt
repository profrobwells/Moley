Taft vs. Eisenhower-
Let's Have a Fair Fight
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has always seemed to me
to be unfortunate when news-
paper commentators engage
in controversy among them-
selves. Hence, it is with some
reluctance that I express re-
gret concerning a recent state-
ment by Walter Lippmann in
which he argued for the nomi-
nation of Gen. Eisenhower. It
seems to me, however, that
now, before the Taft-Eisen-
hower contest runs into a
stage of passion and vitupera-
tion, a word should be said
about restraint.
No one can question Mr.
Lippmann's right, nay, duty,
to inform his readers of his
views on the two leading can-
didates for the Republican
nomination if he has a posi-
tive choice. Nor do I want
to argue that his choice is
wrong. But the following
passage from Mr. Lippmann's
column, it seems to me, con-
tributes to the very thing he
deplores, which is the division
of those who want change
into two bitter, irreconcilable
camps:
"Whereas an Eisenhower
campaign can lead to almost
certain victory by healing and
uniting the nation, a Taft
campaign-since he is the can-
didate only of a faction of a
minority party-must unavoid-
ably stake its hopes on a fierce
and confusing demagogy.
"Sen. Taft is not himself a
demagogue. But he does not
have the political following
now which would enable him
to win, and he has no pros-
pect of getting it without let-
ting the fight be made for him
by the political underworld.
There certainly is no rea-
son to say that a Taft cam-
paign against a Democratic
candidate must resort to dem-
agogy in order to win. It can
and would have access to ex-
actly the same arguments
against the Truman regime as
would an Eisenhower or a
Warren or a Stassen cam-
paign.
The defeat of Truman or a
candidate of his choice must
be accomplished by a rational
appeal to the good sense and
the best interest of American
voters. No one has more per-
sistently and rationally made
that sort of appeal than Sen.
Taft.
Mr. Lippmann admits that
the Senator is no demagogue.
It is ridiculous to say that
someone else will speak for
Taft. No one in public life
in our times has more con-
sistently and stubbornly
spoken for himself.
Certainly a supporter of
Gen. Eisenhower should re-
frain from drawing an invidi-
ous comparison on the ground
of vicarious representation.
For the general has chosen to
let others speak for him for
the next six months.

Twenty years ago, when
Gov. Franklin Roosevelt was
a candidate, Mr. Lippmann
warned us that the man in Al-
bany was merely an inconse-
quential person who wanted
to be President. He said also
that he did not have the intel-
lectual capacity if nominated
to conduct a campaign suc-
cessfully. I will agree with
Mr. Lippmann in criticizing
much of what President Roose-
velt did later, but surely nei-
ther of us could deny that he
could conduct a campaign or
that he was a potent figure.
The deplorable fighting
words in the Lippmann state-
ment are that Sen. Taft's cam-
paign would be made by the
"political underworld." No
candidate in any national cam-
paign can be free from camp
followers who are no credit to
anyone. There can be no cor-
ner on the political under-
world. But to make such a
charge now is a reprehensible
form of debate. For it is un-
substantiated, unfair, and, to
use a Lippmann word, di-
visive.
Sen. Taft and Gen. Eisen-
hower have served their coun-
try with distinction. We shall
not serve that country or the
purpose of bringing about
what Mr. Lippmann and many
of the rest of us want—a
change—by such expressions.
We shall only be serving the
purposes of hopeless disunion.
