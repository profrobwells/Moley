ON TELLING
THE TRUTH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The issues of accountability
and truthfulness were raised
twice last week — once by
President Truman and once
by Sens. McCarthy and Benton.
These cases present two
aspects of responsibility for
what is said and written by
men in public life.

In private life, most people
have very few problems about
what they say or write. They
speak with a sense of personal
responsibility, they say what
is right and true, because they
believe in right and truth. If
any other condition prevailed
generally, our civilization
would break up in confusion.

*

In public life, however, personal
responsibility for what
is said or written becomes a
very serious issue of law or
custom, for the fierce competition
that prevails in public affairs,
especially in politics,
makes the words of public
men weapons for attack or defense.

In President Truman's case,
the question is strictly one of
veracity, and it is a moral rather
than a legal issue. In that
of Sens. McCarthy and Benton,
it is a problem of legal accountability.

In two places in the Truman-
inspired book, "Mr. President,"
the question of truthfulness is
raised — once directly and
once by implication.

The President permits his
editor-author to include a letter
which he says he wrote to
James F. Byrnes, then Secretary
of State, which he did not
send. His claim is that he read
it to Byrnes over the telephone.
This letter sharply criticized
Byrnes for not keeping
the President better informed
about foreign affairs. Byrnes
flatly denies that this reproof
was ever revealed to him in
any way, adding, as well he
might, that if it had been, he
would have resigned.

*

In this issue I would choose
to believe Byrnes for several
reasons. One is the confidence
held in his word during his
many years in the Senate by
his colleagues. The measure
of a man taken by that body
is severe and generally accurate.
Another reason is my
own personal knowledge of
the man over many years.

The other issue of Truman's
truthfulness is by implication.
Surely the Mr. X
in a memorandum of the
President is Henry Wallace.
If so, Wallace directly denies
the charges made in that document.
The President, of
course, may claim that his
Mr. X memorandum is merely
a statement of opinion, but
if so and he sincerely holds
such opinions of Wallace, he
should not now hide behind
a fictitious name.

The President has a place
of unique responsibility. His
word can scarcely be contested
in a libel action, although
there are some rather inconclusive
precedents for that.
The President can scarcely
sue anyone who libels him.
Responsibility, therefore, becomes
personal, and it is even
greater than when backed by
some legal sanction. In these
cases in this book the President
has not shown that he
appreciates the importance of
his position.

In the McCarthy-Benton dispute,
libel is a real factor.
But both men must realize
that libel laws and procedure
are poor ways to resolve their
differences. Both men must
run for office this year and
must realize that no suit for
libel could possibly be tried
and decided before election.

In their case, therefore, the
responsibility for rendering a
verdict on their charges and
countercharges must rest with
the Senate itself.

That body is, after all, the
best means of judging its own
members.
