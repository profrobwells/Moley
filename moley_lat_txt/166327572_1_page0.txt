A JOB ISN'T
A SURE VOTE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Aside from the general observations on the results in
New Hampshire, which have
already been amply supplied,
two fundamental lessons need
to be stressed. These arise
from the indications that Federal officeholders, of whom
there are plenty in and around
the Granite State, hold President Truman in low esteem
and also from the apparently
good labor vote for Taft in
Manchester.

Both of them add to the
mounting volume of evidence
that a very fashionable species
of pessimism is wholly without foundation. A lot of dole-
ful people have been telling us
that as long as there are so
many people on the Federal
payroll there is small hope to
defeat the party in power.
They say that these jobholders and their wives, brothers,
cousins, uncles and aunts will
vote for nothing but the party
presently in power. A well-
known peddler of political
dope has been propagating
this theory for years.
The rational arguments
against this theory are plentiful, but now they are being
buttressed with hard, demonstrated facts. The arguments
go to the realities of human
nature and especially to the
realities of human nature in a
bureaucracy.

People in Federal jobs are, in
an overwhelming proportion
of cases, protected by Civil
Service. The Hoover commission clearly demonstrated that
Civil Service rules are now so
complicated that it takes
many, many months to blast
even a hopelessly incompetent
clerk out of office. Moreover,
it is not at all clear that the
relatives, especially those
once removed, will cast votes
based on the sole grounds of
holding the bureaucrat's job.
Those relatives may have reasons of their own for voting
otherwise.
Finally, there is the mental
bent of the jobholder himself.
He may be deeply resentful of
some slight or discrimination
for which his bosses are responsible. Even in cases of political appointments, gratitude
is not always present. In fact,
in politics gratitude may not
be a major virtue. In most
cases, the jobholder is not
happy with his rate of promotion. In many other cases he
may be proud of his part in the
public service and deeply resent the shadow cast over it
by the thieves and chiselers
in and around the Truman administration.
For all these reasons, it is
foolish to assume that the
Truman machine can control
its own bureaucracy.
The factual evidence that
this reasoning is correct is that
in the counties in Virginia and
Maryland where many thousands of Washington bureaucrats live there has been a
trend in elections toward the
Republican Party.

Now we discover in the New
Hampshire primary that the
Federal machine fell down
completely. It even failed to
get out a decently respectable
vote. And the President fell
before a Senator with no jobs
to give or protect and certainly with no sentimental or ideological ties with New England.
The strong Taft vote in Manchester strengthens the evidence revealed in Ohio in 1950
that labor is far from united
behind its political leadership.
It is probably true that most
union members in Manchester
are Democrats and hence ineligible in a Republican primary. But it can be assumed
that many vote like their
neighbors in a Republican
State. They certainly failed to
respond to the appeals of
Taft's enemies in the labor
movement.
