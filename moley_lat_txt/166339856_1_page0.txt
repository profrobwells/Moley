Speaker Sam Rayburn will
be subject to some bitter criti-
cism for barring television and
radio from committee hear-
ings, but the more the subject
is understood the more his po-
sition will be supported.
This question of TV in Con-
gressional hearings is not en-
tirely parallel to that of the
use of TV in courts, but it has
a fundamental likeness. It
concerns the rights of indi-
viduals as against the govern-
ment and the public behind
the government.
In a very thoughtful and, to
me, convincing article in the
January issue of the Journal
of the American Bar Associa-
tion an able lawyer, William
T. Gossett, discusses the sub-
ject and concludes that he
would prefer that millions of
people should be denied par-
ticipation in Congressional
hearings than that the process
of justice be jeopardized or
that the essential rights of the
individual be denied.
In the course of his article
he quotes the view of Margaret
Webster, a noted theatrical di-
rector, who argued for TV in
the courts because the public
has the capacity to recognize
"the ring of truth."
★
Now I have been entertained,
not to say inspired, many
times by Miss Webster's great
skill in staging plays. She is
one of the most talented cre-
ators of illusions in our the-
ater. But I feel that she ought
to be subject to serious doubt
as an interpreter of funda-
mental issues of jurisprudence
and parliamentary procedure.
For her "public" that is so
qualified to recognize "the ring
of truth" may mean many
things or nothing. And even
if we should grant that there
is an ascertainable "public,"
are we to grant its right to
send people to prison or to
disgrace or otherwise injure
them by some form of plebi-
scite? This form of trial by
mass emotion suggests the
customs in ancient Rome of
letting the crowd determine
the question of life or death in
the arena.
Rudolph Halley, who rode
to all the glory that is af-
forded by the New York pres-
idency of the Council on the
coattails of Kefauver's TV
show, favors the use of TV
not only in Congressional
hearings but in the courts.
His argument is that since the
press coverage of some trials
suggests the atmosphere of a
circus the public should be
admitted. Mr. Gossett disposes
of this in his article by say-
ing that Mr. Halley is saying
in effect that if a circus touch
is given to some trials by
press reports there will be no
harm in "enlarging the tent."
★
The Halley view seems to
be that if the press occasion-
ally veers away from the strict
portrayal of an orderly judi-
cial hearing this failure of jus-
tice should be immensely en-
larged.
The issue comes down to
this: our processes of justice
in the courts have been de-
veloped over the centuries
toward the end that the truth
may be elicited as efficiently
as possible. The means so de-
veloped are designed to pre-
sent in an orderly manner the
two sides of an issue and to
permit the judge and/or jury
to make the vital decision. In
that determination it is ex-
tremely important that the
mass emotions of the public
be excluded.
In short, the public is not
qualified to make these vital
decisions. Anything to divert
attention from this serious,
rational pursuit of the truth is
a bar to justice. And that cer-
tainly includes the trappings
of TV and radio.
The same principle applies
to Congressional hearings.
The purpose there is to get
the facts and judgment essen-
tial to the making of law and
the application of law. In pur-
suing the objective, the essen-
tial rights of individuals are
involved. These should be pro-
tected in Congressional hear-
ings just as they should be in
the courts.
