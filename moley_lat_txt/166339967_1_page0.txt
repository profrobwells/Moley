While we are awaiting the
decision of the Democrats on
the momentous question of
civil rights, we can profitably
examine the Republican dec-
laration of policy on that sub-
ject.
It is perhaps less evasive
than might have been expect-
ed, but still it is a fine ex-
ample of standard political
double-talk. Perhaps it is so
wide a straddle that the Demo-
cratic platform makers might
copy its essential parts ver-
batim.
Great numbers of reasonable
people in the North are com-
ing to realize that the prob-
lems roughly assembled under
the general term "civil rights"
are either inappropriate for
solution by law or, if they are
appropriate for legal action,
that action should be at the
State rather than the Federal
level.
★
People in the North are also
beginning to realize that the
temper of the South is such
that Federal action in civil
rights would be unenforceable
or destructive of national
unity. Moreover, wise politi-
cians on the Republican side
are coming to see that con-
tinued insistence by their
party on Federal action is not
getting them votes except in a
very few States and that to
continue so to insist makes
it impossible for the Repub-
lican Party to make any ma-
terial gains in the South.
Perhaps the most notable
recognition of the need for a
new point of view on this sub-
ject has been in the attitude
of Sen. Taft. On this subject
he, rather than Gov. Dewey
and Sen. Lodge, has been for-
ward-looking. Gen. Eisenhow-
er has followed the Taft line
rather than that of his own
managers.
The Republican verbiage on
civil rights starts with an er-
ror in English which, when
nicely examined, is true while
incorrect, if such a thing can
be. The language condemns
the Democratic Party for do-
ing nothing. In this sentence
the word "party" is in the
singular. Then in the next
sentence the reference is in the
plural. Perhaps that is intend-
ed to mean that the Democrat-
ic Party is nominally one, but
that on this subject it is two.

Then after piously saying
that the Republican Party
"will not mislead" minority
groups, the document does as
patent a job of attempting to
mislead as has ever been done
in a political platform. To
"prove" its "good faith," it
proposed "Federal action to-
ward the elimination of lynch-
ing."
This statement is not only
insincere, but grossly fraudu-
lent. According to the Tuske-
gee Institute, there was only
one lynching last year. The
number per year runs at
about that level. In short,
lynching has practically disap-
peared. What would be the
meaning of "action toward the
elimination of lynching"? To
try to make it certain that
there would only be half a
lynching a year?
Then there is a promise of
"Federal action toward the
elimination of poll taxes." I
am at a loss as to what this
means and I guarantee that
most other reasonable people
are, too. The fact is that poll
taxes, like lynching, are disap-
pearing through the actions of
the Southern States them-
selves.
Even on the hot question of
eliminating segregation in the
District of Columbia the state-
ment is ambiguous. There is
recommended "appropriate ac-
tion." Just what action is "ap-
propriate" is of course a mat-
ter for each person to deter-
mine for himself. In fact, that
is what the whole mess of
words about civil rights
amounts to. Each person can
interpret it in a manner "ap-
propriate" to himself.
It is about time for the Re-
publicans to put into words an
honest statement of the atti-
tude which most of them real-
ly have. Such a statement
would be something like this:
"The Republican Party after
57 years realizes that it cannot
get legislation enacted to thrust
Federal force upon the South-
ern States. It is happy to see
that those States are solving
the problem by themselves.
It will therefore try to snare
votes by other means."
