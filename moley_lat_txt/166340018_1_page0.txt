SAN FRANCISCO â€” The
voice we all heard from Chi-
cago was a refreshing relief
from the shrill demagoguery
of the past seven years. Ste-
venson has proved himself to
be an urbane, sophisticated
spokesman for a political par-
ty that has wandered a long
way from any such standard
for a good many years.
This departure from Tru-
manism was the more marked
on that occasion because we
had in the preceding speech
from Truman himself all the
claptrap, the naked class ap-
peal and the unmitigated ma-
terialism that has been Tru-
man's sole offering and that in
the main describes the Demo-
cratic platform.
Moreover, the choice phrase-
ology of the new candidate
was a blessed emollient for
ears bruised by the hokum,
the ham, the cliches and the
threadbare stuff that charac-
terized the so-called oratory of
the preceding days of the con-
vention. Once more, the Demo-
cratic Party has a leader who
at least pays the American
people the compliment that is
implied in language and logic
appropriate to adult, educated
citizens.
The fact is that Stevenson
should carry Democrats back
to the days of Woodrow Wil-
son. For a close analysis of his
style and argument shows
that as a boy he must have
been profoundly influenced by
the President of the first
World War.
There is in Stevenson a qual-
ity missing in Democratic can-
didates, with the exception of
Al Smith, for a generation. He
has a delicate sense of humor.
This man may fool the Ameri-
can people but he will never
fool himself. That is why
there is none of the messianic
attitude of Wilson and the pos-
turing of Bryan.
Since our comparisons thus
go back to Wilson, let us press
the matter a bit further. So
far as the Stevenson speeches
and statements which I have
seen are concerned there is no
real parallel in the realm of
deep attachment to the great
constitutional traditions. Ste-
venson has already started to
quote Justice Holmes, which
means that he is probably in-
fected with the cynicism of
lawyers trained in the 1920s
when a pragmatic school ele-
vated the old justice to the
hall of the gods. The new can-
didate might be reminded that
no one should try to check the
decay of our constitutional
system and our party system
with his tongue in his cheek.
Nor is there any evidence at
all of the massive courage of
Cleveland, under whom the
grandfather of this man served
as Vice-President. Certainly
Cleveland would never have
offered the assurances to Kroll
and Reuther that made Ste-
venson's nomination possible.
Nor would Cleveland have of-
fered, as answers to the para-
mount issues of the times,
statements that look two ways
at once. He would not have
stated an opinion in two sen-
tences, the second of which
sucks all the meaning from
the first.
As the campaign proceeds
we shall find this latter char-
acteristic of Stevenson the
weak spot in his defense. Ste-
venson is, in fact, an adept in
double talk. That is what Ei-
senhower, with all the cordial-
ity that a campaign between
gentlemen requires, should
nevertheless attack. We ought
to know a Ict more of the
views of this likable man from
Illinois before we elect him
President of the United States.
