Eisenhower Could Profit
by F. D. R.'s Election Plan
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A man who visited Eisen-
hower last year reported that
the General would probably, as
President, emulate Theodore
Roosevelt. That is well and
good. But as a campaigner he
might well study the methods
of the more recent Roosevelt.
For the role of a candidate dif-
fers vastly from that of Presi-
dent. And now that Eisenhow-
er is planning his campaign
and organizing his staff of ad-
visers he might well keep in
mind the general system that
served F. D. R. so well in four
successful Presidential years.
The first principle followed
by that master politician was
to keep sharply separated
those members of the work-
ing staff who were concerned
with political organization
from those who were working
on public policies that were to
be incorporated in speeches
and other means of persuading
voters. The latter group, it
will be recalled, was described
in Roosevelt's first campaign
by the rather clumsy title
"brain trust." The former
was the group headed by the
national chairman. In 1932 the
national chairman was James
A. Farley.

Each group was entirely in-
dependent of the other. In
fact, to sharpen their separa-
tion they occupied offices in
different hotels. The head and
only the head of each group
reported directly to Roosevelt.
They remained entirely friend-
ly with each other, no doubt
because their concerns never
conflicted.
Farley continued through
1936 and Edward J. Flynn
succeeded him in 1940. The
late Robert Hannegan was
chairman in 1944. In 1936 and
thereafter, Judge Samuel I.
Rosenman was boss of the
brain trust. This principle of
separation was always re-
spected by Roosevelt. It will
save Eisenhower endless trou-
bles and possibly disaster if
he will establish it as a first
step.
As a second step, it should
be made clear that the policy
group should have a head who
will be the chief if not the sole
contact with the candidate. To
have a group of advisers
whose views may differ wide-
ly, all trying to sell their
wares to the candidate, will
result in so confusing him that
he will in his statements and
speeches lose all force and con-
viction.
When a speech or public
document is created through
a discussion by many people,
it usually ends up as the least
common denominator of all.
Each person will object to
something, and, to harmonize
matters, that something will
be omitted. In the end, the
document or speech will lose
all punch and bite.
★
Something of this must have
happened in some of the pre-
convention speeches of Eisen-
hower. It was especially true
of the speech intended for de-
livery in Detroit. At that time
there were apparently three
competing documents, and fi-
nally Eisenhower in exaspera-
tion threw them all out and
spoke "off the cuff."
The head of the group must
take the ideas of everyone
and organize and select what
seems best to him. Then he,
and he alone, must spend
hours over the preparation of
the speech with the candidate.
The result will be not a crude,
ghost-written speech, but a
message which is truly an ex-
pression of the candidate's
own conviction. This, as I in-
dicate above, was the way
Roosevelt worked. And this
method had the supreme vir-
tue. It passed the pragmatic
test. It won elections.
Eisenhower can win this
election. But his organization
must be workable and compe-
tent. For he cannot win it
alone.
