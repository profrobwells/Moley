LAST FLIGHT
OF ALBEN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Twice in his life Alben
Barkley might have taken the
melancholy expression of Cardinal
Wolsey in "King Henry
VIII" as his own. For twice
his zealous loyalty to a man
has ended in bitter words.

Eight years ago, when President
Roosevelt vetoed a tax
bill with an insulting message
to Congress, Barkley, then
Senate majority leader, resigned
in protest. In so doing
he said that he had loyally carried
the banner of the President
and that this was a
shameful reward. It might
have been suggested then that
as an officer of the Senate
he should have been carrying
its banner rather than that of
the President.

*

And in this convention, after
the labor bosses refused to
endorse his candidacy, he withdrew
from the race. But only
a few weeks ago he was saying,
in loyal support of President
Truman, that the steel
companies were very, very bad
people and that the unions
were very, very good people.
This is not to say that the
lovable Vice-President does not
deserve the sympathy which
is extended to him at this
tragic moment in his life. He
has served his country and
his party well. Some of us
would have had him identify
his country and party somewhat
less. But he has been a
fair fighter, a gentleman and a
statesman. He is, in fact, the
only real statesman who appeared
at this convention as a
Presidential candidate.

The Barkley incident, however,
is vastly more important
as an expression of what
is happening to the Democratic
Party than in its bearing upon
the ambitions and fortunes of
any individual. Seventeen
years ago, with great deliberation
President Roosevelt
decided to merge the fortunes
of his party with those of organized
labor. Up to that time
labor had properly been a factor
in every Presidential campaign.

*

But with the passage of the
Wagner Act in 1935 an alliance
was created which has
grown more and more firm.
It has now resulted in giving
leaders of great labor groups
a decisive power in the party.
The Democratic Party of such
individualists as Cleveland
and Wilson has in fact become
a Socialist labor party.

When James F. Byrnes was
told by F. D. R. in 1944 to clear
his candidacy for Vice-President
with Sidney Hillman, the
influence of labor bosses was
secondary. Ultimate power
rested with the President and
the city bosses. Now, however,
the influence of the labor
leaders has become paramount.

â˜…

The strong city bosses are
no longer in power. Ed Kelley
is dead. Hague is out of power.
Flynn is ill. But Murray
and Kroll and Reuther and
others are in the saddle.

Witness what has happened.
Two of the candidates, Kefauver
and Harriman, have almost
literally groveled at the
feet of the labor bosses. Russell,
to the sorrow of his
friends, forsook his earlier
convictions and called for the
repeal of the Taft-Hartley
Act. Stevenson was apparently
thoroughly cleared with
Murray, et al., while Barkley
asked for their aid and was re-
buffed. Thereupon, humbly
bowing before that drumhead
tribunal, he withdrew.

The year 1952 will be remembered
in history as witnessing a revolution
in party
history. It may, in fact, mark
the end of the two-party system.
