Every four years, after
those absurd carnivals known
as national conventions are
over, there are proposed varí-
ous methods of making them
more orderly and rational.
Every four years party lead-
ers, with hands on hearts, say:
"Never again."
Now that the imbecilities of
those conventions are brought
by radio and television into
the more or less sacred Ameri-
can home, a great skepticism
is aroused about the integrity
and sanity of American po-
litical institutions. And after
this reaction has passed, things
proceed as before.
Most of the suggestions for
reform favor more Presiden-
tial primaries. One such sug-
gestion is that there be en-
acted by Congress a nation-
wide primary system. This
was the remedy of the old Pro-
gressives of the early 1900s. At
that time primary laws were
enacted in a dozen or more
States which provided for a
direct vote for Presidential
candidates. After 1912 this
movement lagged and finally
stopped. Only a minority of
States have such methods of
choice.

Some form of convention
system is still the standard
method of selecting delegates
and of providing them with in-
structions.
I very greatly doubt the de-
sirability of extending the di-
rect preferential choice to all
the States. Such a system
would almost automatically
permit a person who actively
seeks the nomination and who
is equipped with a huge bank
roll to win a nomination. It
would deny the delegates at
the convention itself the right
to deliberate and exercise their
independent judgment in se-
lecting a candidate.
In the recent Democratie
convention it would have as-
sured the nomination of Ke-
fauver and denied the nomina-
tion to Stevenson, whom most
good judges of politics regard
as more likely to win.

More democracy is certainly
not the way to reform the con-
vention system. The remedy
must be better primary and
convention laws in the States
and greater responsibility in
the national committees of
the parties.
Each national committee
should create a sizable execu-
tive committee which, during
the four years between elec-
tions, is really active. It should
prepare a draft platform long
in advance, after hearing from
all pertinent interests. It is ab-
surd to attempt to create a
platform in the heat and hurry
of the week before the conven-
tion. Such a proposed draft
could go to all delegates as
soon as they are selected, and
thus they would have time to
consider it and prepare to vote
intelligently upon its various
provisions.
★
The problem of contesting
delegations could be greatly
simplified if the national com-
mittee would set up machinery
by which it might have repre-
sentatives on the ground at
the time delegates are selected
in the various States. These
representatives could prepare
the way for the hearing of con-
tests by submitting reports to
the committee.
The rule adopted by the Re-
publican convention with re-
spect to the voting rights of
contested delegations cannot
be allowed to stand. Such a
rule might, as the Taft people
pointed out, make a farce of
the convention.
The actual routine of the
roll calls should be improved.
It is intolerable to permit the
calling for a poll of the dele-
gates by anyone who is either
dissatisfied or desirous of de-
lay. The actual poll of the in-
dividual delegates could be
made by a representative of
the chairman or the clerk
while the roll call proceeds
with other States.
★
If the purpose of these pub-
lic polls of individuals is to re-
veal how each person votes,
the list could be made public
after the roll call. These de-
lays result in confusion and
weariness, and because they
may prolong the convention
an extra day or more, they cost
delegates a great deal of extra
expense money.
Finally, some sort of rules
should be adopted to limit or
eliminate infantile, synthetic
demonstrations.
There is no better way to se-
lect candidates than a nation-
al convention. But the conven-
tion must be very radically im-
proved.
