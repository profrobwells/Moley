JUDY GOES
FREE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Except for one very unfor-
tunate slip, Judith Coplon has
lived a very lucky life. And
her lucky star has seemed to
emerge from the cloud occa-
sioned by that slip. For it
looks now as if the Depart-
ment of Justice will never
again bring her to trial.
For this the department can-
not he censured too much.
Nor can we quarrel too vio-
lently with the technicalities
of the law which have come
to her rescue. For they were
created to guard the innocent
despite the occasional escape
of the guilty.
It is a bit of sour irony that
the Anglo-American principles
of justice should thus shield
a person who betrayed that
very tradition.
Meanwhile Judith is mar-
ried, has a child and is at lib-
erty under the protection of
the government which she
served so badly.
★
She was tried twice and was
twice found guilty. In a dis-
trict court in Washington she
was found guilty of taking the
documents from the Justice
Department where she worked
and which were later found
on her person in New York.
In New York she was tried
and found guilty with her Com-
munist friend Valentine Gubit-
chev of "conspiring to defraud
the United States" and was
found guilty alone of "attempt-
ing to deliver defense infor-
mation to a citizen of a for-
eign nation."
However, the convictions
were set aside by the two
Courts of Appeals. The one
in the District of Columbia,
ruled that Coplon's arrest in
New York was legal and that
her sentence was valid but the
verdict was set aside and a
new trial ordered. The basis
of this was that her telephone
conversations were tapped
during the trial.
In New York the Court of
Appeals declared that her ar-
rest was illegal although Judge
Learned Hand, who delivered
the opinion, said that the evi-
dence "must have satisfied any
fair-minded jury that she was
engaged in the conspiracy
with which she was charged."
It may seem odd that the
two Courts of Appeals should
rule exactly contrary to each
other on the legality of the
Coplon arrest. But that sort
of thing, somewhat confusing
to a layman, is inevitable in
a system such as ours in
which the independence of the
judiciary is strictly respected.
★
Judge Hand in thus overrul-
ing the District Court as well
as taking issue with the other
Court of Appeals goes into con-
siderable detail. He shows that
there was plenty of time in
which the FBI could have ob-
tained a warrant. He also as-
serted that there was no imme-
diate danger that Judith might
escape. Hence the decision
that the arrest was illegal and
also on the wire-tapping side
that vital evidence should have
been inadmissible.
He did intimate that Con-
gress might broaden the power
of the FBI to arrest without a
warrant and also that under
certain circumstances there
should be limits to the immu-
nity of citizens from wire-tap-
ping.
The reluctance of the De-
partment of Justice to bring
Coplon to trial should not be
condemned. Under the two de-
cisions of the Courts of Ap-
peals the prosecution would be
denied the vital evidence nec-
essary to a conviction. Under
the circumstances it may be
better to close the books
rather than to risk another le-
gal debacle which would have
the effect of intensifying the
impatience of the public with
all law and judicial procedure.
What is to be hoped is that the
police agencies of the govern-
ment will take this lesson to
heart and sharpen their effi-
ciency.

The public, however, is en-
titled to visit its own judgment
upon this young woman. She
was very fortunate and highly
honored and compensated by
her government for what
would appear to be rather
small talents and certainly
meager experience.
Fresh from college, she was
drawing, in her job in Wash-
ington, a salary equal to that
of a full professor. She had
been favored in college. In
short, after this country,
whose ideals are the antithesis
of all those of Marx and Lenin,
had done so much for her, she
was ready to betray it.
I once asked a teacher who
had her in Barnard College
what sort of student she was.
The teacher said that she was
always complaining that "no-
body loved her." I suggested
in reply that the United States
loved her and that she gave
treachery in return.
Perhaps she will have to
take the measure of her pun-
ishment in the shadow of the
verdicts of two juries and sev-
eral judges that she was guilty
but that she regained her
liberty because her govern-
ment was guilty of momentary
incompetence.
