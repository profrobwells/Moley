Whittaker Chambers, in his
strange but moving style, has
in one of his Saturday Eve-
ning Post articles pointed to a
situation in Washington that
has not been sufficiently em-
phasized. It is the kinship—
perhaps not deliberately
planned—between the Com-
munist movement and the des-
perate urge of so-called lib-
erals to enlarge the powers of
the Federal government. He
writes:
*
"The simple fact is that
when I took up my little sling
and aimed at Communism I
also hit something else. What
I hit was the forces of that
great socialist revolution,
which, in the name of liberal-
ism, spasmodically, incom-
pletely, somewhat formlessly,
but always in the same direc-
tion, has been inching its ice
cap over the nation for two
decades. This is not a charge.
My opinion of that revolution
is not at issue.
"It was the forces of that
revolution that I struck, at the
point of its struggle for pow-
er. And with that we come to
the heart of the Hiss case and
all its strange manifestations.
No one could have been more
dismayed than I am at what
I had hit, for though I knew it
existed, I still had no adequate
idea of its extent, the depth
of its penetration or the fierce
vindictiveness of its revolu-
tionary temper, which is a re-
flex of its struggle to keep and
advance its political power."

Chambers in his article is
not, nor am I in this piece ac-
cusing the seemingly benign
promoters of the welfare
state of sympathy with Soviet
imperialism. They would fight
and die to prevent its ascen-
dancy.
But the very nature of their
formula for checking Commu-
nism implies a disposition to
be more or less tolerant of the
benighted followers of Com-
munism in their midst. For in
a deluded belief that they are
being liberal, they think that
to adopt a large measure of
Socialism here is to make us
safer from Communism. In
other words, they think that
the only way to combat Marx-
ism is to adopt it piece by
piece. So they accept the the-
sis that the reason people be-
come Communist is that the
capitalist system has not been
fair to them.
The fallacy of these assump-
tions should be easy to see.
The adoption of Socialism by
degrees sets in motion a proc-
ess of weakening of the free
system which leaves it wide
open to infection. And an ex-
amination of the social condi-
tions of the peoples of the
world shows that poverty is
greatest where there is no
capitalism.

As Chambers says, the most
virile opposition to the efforts
to root Communists out of
Washington has come from
the people who believe most
implicitly in the state as an
all-powerful protector. It is
the misguided and misnamed
liberals who have been shout-
ing the loudest about red her-
rings.
