BIPARTISAN SOCIALISM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If ever there was a good
example of perfect co-ordina-
tion between Sen. Wayne
Morse and the Truman ad-
ministration, it was the recent
revival of the drive to get Con-
gressional action on the pro-
posal to build a superpower
dam at Hell's Canyon on the
Idaho-Oregon border,
*
This co-operation between
left-wing Republicans and
President Truman works much
better than the late, forgot-
ten party unity on foreign
policy. This new unity on do-
mestic spending might appro-
priately be called bipartisan
Socialism. It deserves careful
scrutiny and plenty of debate.
For it introduces a form of
life into our country for which
there has never been a popu-
lar mandate.
I shall point out the Morse-
Truman strategy first and then
comment briefly on the mer-
its of the project itself.
On March 7 Morse made a
three-hour speech introducing
a bill to authorize the build-
ing of the Hell's Canyon dam.
He was joined in the introduc-
tion of the bill by five Fair
Deal Democrats—Magnuson,
Murray, Lenman, Hill and Ke-
fauver. Note the absence of
any Republican colleague.
*
I am not certain that March
7 was selected with any
thought of what that date sug-
gested in American history, al-
though Morse was once a pro-
fessor and he was also once
an able student of mine at Co-
lumbia. Perhaps he conceived
the parallelism himself. At
any rate, March 7 was the
102nd anniversary of Daniel
Webster's immortal speech in
which he broke with his Whig
Party and in effect consigned
that party to oblivion. It can
confidently be expected that
neither this speech nor the
Senator who delivered it will
destroy the Republican Party.
But if the party survives, it
will not be because of any sup-
port by the junior Senator
from Oregon.
Morse made it clear at the
outset of his speech that he
was speaking for the record
alone. He announced that he
would not yield during its
course to interruptions and
that his purpose was "to have
it in such form that it may be
reprinted and used as a refer-
ence work"—in short, as prop-
aganda through the mails and
otherwise.
★
Six days later there was a
convention of the National
Electric Co-operative Associa-
tion in Chicago. This provided
a perfect sounding board for
loud attacks on private utility
companies. Secretary Chapman
appeared and read a long,
demagogic message from Pres-
ident Truman attacking the
"forces of reaction" in his best
1948 style and calling for the
building of the Hell's Canyon
project.
Is it possible that Sen.
Morse's "reference work" was
created as part of this Social-
istic tub thumping?
In any event, it will be a
long time before this vast proj-
ect is authorized. The State
of Idaho is solidly against it.
There is no economic justifica-
tion for it now when Federal
spending already has reached
astronomical heights. The plea
for it as a "defense" measure
is specious. The proposal to
push it now reeks with poli-
tics and it is to be regretted
that Sen. Morse has made it
bipartisan politics.

An identical bill was intro-
duced in the House earlier and
hearings are now beginning.
Later on I shall present some
of the facts and arguments
concerning the merits of this
project.
