KEFAUVER'S
RECORD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While observing the mental
contortions of Estes Kefauver
on "Meet the Press" last Sun-
day, there occurred to me an
idea more important than the
exact nature of this Senator's
convictions.
That idea is that the exact
nature of the convictions of
any Senator or Congressman
can scarcely ever be determined
by his voting record in
Congress. Even in the case of
the forthright Sen. Taft the
position of the man on nearly
all public questions has been
presented in speeches and
statements, rather than in
votes.
Thus the point of view of
many members of Congress is
almost as difficult to determine
as that of a man like
Gen. Eisenhower, who has
been locked within the political
vacuum of the military
most of his life or, as was the
case of Charles Evans Hughes
in 1916, a man who has enjoyed
the detachment of the
Supreme Court. A record is
there, but it can be blurred in
a mass of contradictory votes.
★
Since a member of Congress
is a politician who would, if
he could, be all things to all
men, this process of building
alibis and loopholes in a voting
record is generally done
with calculation and foresight.
It is quite natural for political
opponents to attack on the
basis of a voting record, and
therefore the member of Congress
carefully provides offsets
for nearly all contingencies.
Never has this been revealed
more clearly than in the Kefauver
case. This champion in
a one-man race faces heavy opposition
before the final showdown.
President Truman will probably
destroy the Kefauver candidacy
if he can find a satisfactory
substitute. Hence, Kefauver
must stick sufficiently
close to the Truman line to
overcome any Presidential objections.
He must hold some
shreds of affiliation with the
South because, after all, his
State is well below the border.
He cannot hope to win a nomination
without the Humphrey-
ADA-CIO element in the North.
This combination of stresses,
strains and pressures is a
virtually impossible problem.
It has not, however, embarrassed
the agile Sen. Kefauver.
★
He feels that his successful
primary runs have proved
that a man actually can be all
things to all men. That is, he
can fool all the voters some
of the time. But this virtuosity
in the art of double talk did
not seem to impress his questioners
in his TV performance.
For the net of it was to reveal
that Kefauver had voted for
and against antilynching. He
was for local law enforcement
unless local law enforcement
should break down. But he did
not say who should decide
when local law enforcement
breaks down. That, of course,
is the nub of the matter.
He is also against a compulsory
FEPC, but spoke favorably
of a voluntary one. But if
Congress should pass a compulsory
one, he could, presumably,
as President, accept it.
All of which shows how difficult
it is to judge a man's
views on the basis of his voting
record. Only a clear-cut,
detached public assertion of
his beliefs can suffice or, as an
alternative, a free exposure to
the penetrating questions of
the press.
A Congressman can vote to
please everybody for a long
time but a President must
make decisions. This is something
to remember when we
choose candidates.
