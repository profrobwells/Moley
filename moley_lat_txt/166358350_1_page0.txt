The reviews of Whittaker
Chambers' book, "Witness,"
seem to be nearly unanimous
in saying that it is a massive,
frightening and perhaps great
piece of literature. It is also
a very important page in
American history. When the
Chambers story was running
in the Saturday Evening Post
I discussed in this column
what seemed to me the pres-
ent political significance of the
book.
Now, however, an additional
point, touched upon by some
perceptive reviewers, needs to
be stressed. It is Chambers'
oversimplification of the dif-
ference between Communism
and the prevailing way of life
of the western free nations.
This oversimplification is made
more emphatic by Chambers'
emotional approach to great
political problems.
He does not make clear what
political faith he has retreated
to, but he says it is the way
of God. Communism, he says,
is the way of man, exalted to
the stature of God. All through
the book there are allusions to
this black-or-white choice, but
he brings it out most clearly
in his introductory "Letter to
My Children" in this way:
"The Communist vision is
the vision of man without
God.
"It is the vision of man's
mind displacing God as the
creative intelligence of the
world. It is the vision of
man's liberated mind, as the
sole force of its rational in-
telligence, redirecting man's
destiny and reorganizing man's
life and the world. It is the
vision of man, once more the
central figure of the creation,
not because God made man in
his image, but because man's
mind makes him the most in-
telligent of the animals.
"Hence the Communist
Party is quite justified in call-
ing itself the most revolution-
ary party in history. It has
posed in practical form the
most revolutionary question
in history: God or man?"
The alternative to which
Chambers retreated when he
risked death to break with the
Communist Party is thus
stated:
"One thing, most ex-Com-
munists could agree upon:
They broke because they
wanted to be free. They do not
all mean the same thing by
'free.' Freedom is a need of
the soul, and nothing else. It
is in striving toward God that
the soul strives continually
after a condition of freedom.
God alone is the inciter and
guarantor of freedom. A
Communist breaks because he
must choose at last between
irreconcilable opposites—God
or man, soul or mind, freedom
or Communism."
If this were the simple
choice, the salvation of the
western way of life could be
assured by the preaching of a
religious crusade. But an om-
niscient God must want some-
thing more from men in whom
he has placed such great ca-
pacities for rational action. We
cannot throw all our problems
back into the lap of God.
What we have is a system
of liberty built by man—with
the help of God, it is true. That
system has the capacity to
bring reasonable happiness to
mankind. But its mastery re-
quires men's minds as well as
their emotions. Moreover, as
Santayana in his most recent,
great book, "Dominations and
Powers," has made clear,
there is a distinction between
freedom and liberty. Freedom
implies no vital process, noth-
ing that makes it a value in
itself. Liberty is a way of life
created by men who believe
in man as well as in God. It
offers the real hope of the
world.
