DISSERVICE TO TAFT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Surely no one who has read
this column can charge that
I have not held a fairly even
balance in the present Taft-
Eisenhower contest. If there
has been any deviation from
neutrality, it has been toward
the Taft side.
It is still a slight leaning to-
ward Taft that moves me to
believe that the action of
Henry Zweifel and his "regu-
lar" Republicans in the Texas
State convention was not only
unfair, but a stupid, selfish
disservice to Taft.
If I were an ardent and not
too scrupulous Eisenhower
worker, I would hail this
Texas business as a big boost
for my man, because it en-
ables Eisenhower partisans for
the first time to raise a cry of
fraud. Until now, the two sides
have occasionally spoken of
bad faith and misrepresenta-
tion. Now all the synonyms of
theft can be used. And there
is enough justification for that
to sway many more delegates
than the 30-odd Taft votes
gained by the Texas action.
Already we can hear the
echoes of that battle long ago
when Theodore Roosevelt
stood before the Progressive
convention in Chicago in 1912
and said of the earlier conven-
tion that had renominated Wil-
liam H. Taft as a body: "...
wherein sat, alas! a majority
of men who, with sneering in-
difference to every principle of
right, so acted as to bring to a
shameful end a party which
had been founded over half a
century ago by men in whose
souls burned the fire of lofty
endeavor."
The Republican Party was
not killed then, but, torn apart
by that conflict, it was driven
from power for eight years.
A much greater crisis faces
the nation now than in those
peaceful, pastoral days of 1912.
And good people everywhere
are hoping that the Republi-
can Party can offer a change
of persons and policies in
Washington. If this hope is
not fulfilled, it will be the fault
of the selfish, narrow-minded
Zweifels in the Republican
Party.

I am not offering this opin-
ion on the basis of once or
twice removed information.
Four weeks ago I was present
in Texas at precinct conven-
tions where the first steps
were taken. I saw former
Democrats swarm into Repub-
lican conventions and re-
nounce their traditional faith.
I talked with a number of
them. I know that they were
recruits who believed that the
welfare of the nation and the
State would best be served if
they left the Democratic Party
and joined in a Republican
effort to carry Texas.
So far as I saw and was able
to learn, these were good cit-
izens and they had been good
Democrats. The Democratic
Party hated to lose them. But
they exercised a right, which
we all have, to change parties.
For years, the Republican
leaders in Texas have been
content to keep their party
small, neat and clublike. Its
objective has not been to be-
come a real alternative party,
but to share in the fruits of a
future victory won in other
States by other Republicans.
Under such leadership there
would be no hope for the de-
velopment of a two-party sys-
tem in Texas. Now, with this
infusion of new, fresh blood,
there is such a hope.
But that hope will die if
this highhanded action is ap-
proved at Chicago. Moreover,
unless Sen. Taft himself dis-
approves of it, his cause will
be seriously injured and the
prospects of Republican har-
mony will be materially dark-
ened.
