Eisenhower Can Profit
From Story of Hoover
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the books that might
be read with profit by Gen.
Eisenhower before he returns
to his native grounds is the
second volume of "The Mem-
oirs of Herbert Hoover," just
published. For our only liv-
ing ex-President once occupied
a position much like that of
Gen. Eisenhower when he re-
turned to the United States
after the war.
Hoover tells how, in 1919,
he and his family returned
from Europe in the fond hope
of enjoying a spell of quiet,
private family life. This dream
was quickly dispelled by the
demands of a tide of popu-
larity which exceeded that of
any other hero of World War
I. The demands upon Hoover
were as great as those that
fell upon Eisenhower in 1945.
Hoover and his family
planned and built a house ac-
cording to the specifications of
their dreams. But they found
little time in the next 14 years
to occupy it. He solemnly
made rules for the husbanding
of his time and energy. Those
rules remained dead letters un-
til 1933. Despite his reluctance
at first, he was swept back into
the whirl of public life. He
escaped the infection of Presi-
dential candidacy but soon
found himself in the Cabinet
of a new President. He was
consigned to Washington's en-
ervating atmosphere for 12
chaotic years.

The story of those years fills
the body of the book, and
Hoover's ideas of government
service written there might
well instruct the new hero
who seeks a like career. But
more important to him is
Hoover's way with the ups
and downs of personal popu-
larity.
According to Hoover, the
span of life is not measured in
periods of seven years, as in
Joseph's interpretation of the
Pharaoh's dream. Instead,
Hoover was doomed to 14 fat
years of popularity followed
by 14 years of personal ordeal
the like of which has been
endured by few public figures
in our history. A revealing
footnote in the book says:
"My period of popularity
lasted nearly 14 years, which
seems about the average.
When the ultimate bump came
I was well fortified to accept
it philosophically and, in fact,
to welcome it, for democracy
is a harsh employer.
*
"In the ensuing period, also
of 14 years, I succeeded in
reaching fairly deep unpopu-
larity in consequence of the
depression, fighting the New
Deal, opposing World War II
and its subsequent political
policies. But after this second
term of 14 years some people
began to think I had been
right and life was more com-
plimentary."
The end of Hoover's "winter
of discontent" was roughly
1947, when the American peo-
ple began to see clearly the
rugged lineaments of Hoover's
Quaker character and faith. It
is not without significance that
President Truman helped in
this restoration by calling
upon the ex-President for new
public service.
For Truman, despite his
shortcomings as a President
and his unbecoming fits of vin-
dictive rage, proved to be a
more generous opponent than
did F. D. R. But it was neither
the President nor the public
that made the "new" Hoover.
It was the character of the
man and the American ideals
in which he believed that final-
ly prevailed.
Gen. Eisenhower may or
may not become President.
But he faces an ordeal not un-
like that which Hoover en-
dured. He had better be ready
with a stout heart and a clear
head.
