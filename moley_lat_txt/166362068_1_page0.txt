POLITICS AT
COLUMBIA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The New York papers gave
some prominence a few days
ago to a claim by one Carl
Ackerman that he was declar-
ing for Adlai Stevenson, de-
spite an attempt to gag him.
at he is a member of the
culty of Columbia Univer-
y's Graduate School of
urnalism. It is important
two reasons. One is that if
ain Carl Ackerman should
me out for Stevenson it
ould mean very little. No
wspaper would note it. It is
e name of the university
at makes him newsworthy.
nd it is the fact that Eisen-
wer is president of Colum-
a that puts it on the front
ge.

The other reason why it is
mportant is that Ackerman,
ing a journalist, knows how
get headlines. For if a Co-
1mbia University teacher
tould come out for Steven-
n it would pass without
ote. But if a Columbia Uni-
ersity professor says that
mebody tried to gag him it
news. I mean no disrespect
› Carl Ackerman when I sug-
est that it is a case of man
ites dog.
For of all things, Columbia
niversity has been free of
ags these many years. It has
een political since Alexander
(amilton was a student two
enturies ago,
To attempt to gag a Colum-
ia professor would be like
ying to mop up Lake Supe-
or with a washrag. If any-
ody gags a Columbia profes-
or, it is either his wife or
imself. The university au-
norities know it wouldn't
'ork, even if it were wise.
I say this not only with feel-
ng but with authority, for I
m myself in my 30th year as
Columbia University profes-
or.

But Ackerman gave up a
retty large price in the coin-
ge of fair play to get his head-
ne, for no gag was suggested.
What the acting head of the
niversity, Grayson Kirk, had
uggested was that a very
mall number of deans and ad-
ninistrative officers refrain
rom active participation in
he campaign because such
articipation would suggest
hat the university as an in-
titution was taking sides.
This suggestion-and that is
Il it was was intended to ap-
oly to supporters of Eisen-
lower as well.
Since the Ackerman affair,
he inevitable round robins
have been chirping up at Co-
umbia, Round robins are as
ndigenous to an academic at-
mosphere as ivy or elm trees.
A Stevenson round robin
appeared in which more than
100 "members of the faculty"
vere assembled. This gather-
ng was a very inclusive one.
It included many assistants
and lecturers with no profes-
sional standing, also, people
who are listed merely by
courtesy in the Columbia cat-
alogue but whose real jobs are
elsewhere. In fact, among the
list, there were few people of
distinction. On careful reading
I found only about 20 that I
had ever heard of before. And
it must be noted that this 300-
odd constitute only about 8%
of the 3786 officers of the insti-
tution.

Moreover, another, pro-
Eisenhower list followed the
pro-Stevenson one, which
about canceled the whole mat-
ter.
These round robins at Co-
lumbia in Presidential years
are not new. The most notable
one was a list of supporters of
Al Smith in 1928. They should
be taken with several grains
of salt.
It should be noted further
that in an institution like Co-
lumbia there is a very heavy
infusion of radicalism, perhaps
not more than in other urban
institutions, but significant.
This figures in such demon-
strations. Prevailing opinion at
Columbia has always been
heavily Democratic.
