SMITH-ROOSEVELT
FIGHT OF '32 HAS
A PARALLEL NOW
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A great deal has been made
of the parallel between the
present controversy over con-
tested delegates in the Repub-
lican convention and the inci-
dents preceding the great bolt
by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.
Several commentators have
pointed out that the parallel is
superficial, especially so far
as the suggestion of a party
split is concerned.
★
So far as I know there has
been no comment thus far on
another preconvention contro-
versy which did not result in
a holt and that had no serious
effect upon party success. I re-
fer to the once-famous strug-
gle between the forces of Al
Smith and F. D. R. for control
of the 1932 Democratic con-
vention. Unlike the present
situation, that contest 20 years
ago specifically involved good
or bad faith on the part of one
of the principals, Roosevelt
himself. It also involved in its
ramifications a question of the
truthfulness of the future
President.
Up to the time of the con-
vention that year the machin-
ery of the national committee
was in the hands of the friends
of Smith, who somewhat be-
latedly had decided to fight
for the nomination. The late
John Raskob was chairman of
the national committee. Jouett
Shouse was the paid chief
executive of the national
committee and also chairman
of the executive committee.
The final issue was the selec-
tion of the keynoter and the
temporary and permanent
chairmen of the convention.
★
The committee on arrange-
ments, which was to a degree
dominated by the Smith fac-
tion, proposed to recommend
as both temporary and per-
manent chairman Jouett
Shouse. This would have given
him the additional role of key-
noter. The committee did not
resolve this at once but de-
layed action pending a refer-
ence to Roosevelt of a compro-
mise suggested by Harry Byrd
of Virginia. This compromise
would have named Alben
Barkley as keynoter and
Shouse as permanent chair-
man.
There is still violent dis-
agreement about what hap-
pened. Two sources sympathet-
ic with Roosevelt, Edward J.
Flynn and James A. Farley (in
his earlier book, "Behind the
Ballots," written before his dis-
agreement with F. D. R.), put
it this way:
After the compromise was
proposed, Farley and Robert
Jackson of New Hampshire
(not the justice) talked with
Roosevelt on the telephone.
Roosevelt told them that the
committee on arrangements
had no authority to name or
to recommend a permanent
chairman. He said, though,
that he would agree to the
naming of Barkley, who was
pro-Roosevelt, as keynoter and
would agree that the commit-
tee should "commend" Shouse
for permanent chairman. The
committee, according to Far-
ley and Flynn, acted upon this
suggestion.
But it had been determined
by the Roosevelt people before
this that Sen. Thomas J. Walsh
of Montana, a Roosevelt man,
should be elected permanent
chairman. They had the dele-
gate strength in the conven-
tion to do this and they pro-
ceeded to take that action.
The importance of the per-
manent chairman in that con-
vention was notable because
under the two-thirds rule it
promised to be a tough battle.
At the outset Roosevelt had
a majority which was effective
in deciding the selection of of-
ficers and in determining pro-
cedure, but he lacked the two-
thirds necessary to the nomi-
nation.
★
Very bitter things have been
said by the Smith people in
the years since that event.
They center upon the etymo-
logical difference, if any, be-
tween the word "commend"
and the word "recommend."
Webster seems to be a bit
foggy on the subject.
The moral issue, it seems to
me, is whether the word, if
used, was selected to deceive
the Smith people and whether
they, in good faith, took it to
be Roosevelt's agreement to
Shouse's selection. The pur-
pose of this article is not to
resolve that question. I can
say that both Flynn and Far-
ley protest the rectitude of
their course so earnestly that
I wonder if they do not have
some mutterings in the region
of their consciences. I must
add in truth that there were
times when it was quite diffi-
cult to reconcile Roosevelt's
various statements on many
subjects.
★
My main purpose in bring-
ing up this bit of history is to
make two points that are very
much in the minds of people
here and now. One is that
fights, even bitter ones, do
not necessarily result in party
splits or impair a party's
chances to win. The second is
that the possession of a numer-
ical majority does not neces-
sarily justify the setting aside
of rules and laws.
The mere fact that some of
these present contests are
based upon claims that major-
ities supported Eisenhower
delegates does not set aside
the laws governing those mat-
ters. Nor does the possession
of a majority of the national
committee permit the setting
aside of the legal equities in-
volved. Might does not make
right, even the might of a
majority. This applies to both
Taft and Eisenhower.
