EISENHOWER IS LEARNING
'DON'TS' FOR CANDIDATES
BY TRIAL AND ERROR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is becoming more and a conservative or a liberal.
more apparent that Eisen-
hower is a man with moder-
ately conservative views, is
truly willing to listen and
learn and, if nominated
and elected, might make a good
President.
But any advantage that he
might gain from these quali-
ties is rapidly being destroyed
by the incredible mistakes of
the people around him and
by his own lack of political
experience.
*
Among the "don'ts" for can-
didates in the heat of a cam-
paign the following are para-
mount:
1-Don't waste time and
draw attention to attacks by
the opposition by defending
yourself directly. Defense can
be made by others or by in-
direction.
2-Don't apologize for your
views or characterize them by
meaningless words.
3-Don't qualify your pre-
vious statements in a way that
will permit supporters, who do
not agree with those views, to
make it appear that you do
not mean what you say.
4-Above all, don't recant.
I should make it clear that
these don'ts are for candi-
dates in the heat of a cam-
paign. They are not intended
as rules for the rest of mortal
men toiling through life. For
that vast mass of people,
humility and willingness to
modify views are virtues.
*
I may also add that these
rules were deeply impressed
upon me by long experience
in what was the most success-
ful group of politicians of
modern times. They were
also, regardless of what you
may think of what they visited
upon this country, the most
crafty and effective. I refer to
the group including Farley,
Flynn, Howe and others who
nominated and selected
F. D. R. Roosevelt himself
was the master of them all.
The general violated the
first of these don'ts by bring-
ing in the apologetic note in
his Detroit speech. The sec-
ond by the quibbling with the
reporters over whether he is
This is pretty silly stuff.
One reporter says that El-
senhower is worried because
some people are calling him
conservative. Hence he says
in the words of that reporter
that "the general sees himself
as having a liberal stripeâ€”
liberal in the sense of fighting
for individual rights against
group pressures." The general
ought to be informed that the
Socialists in Washington have
mauled and mangled the once
good word liberal until it
means nothing at all.
The general is quite con-
fused on the steel issue and
makes matters more confused
by stating the details of his
confusion.

Finally he has all but re-
canted his view that the
States should have title to
the tidelands. First he was
quite positive about it. Then
he apparently was told that
the Supreme Court had de-
clared that the tidelands be-
longed to the Federal govern-
ment. Without apparently
going into the matter further
he then veered to the other
side. What he ought to be
told is that as President his
job will be to decide whether
to approve or disapprove the
action that Congress will take
to restore the tidelands to the
States.
What seems to be happen-
ing is that a group of people
including some leftist report-
ers is gradually, by a process
of shrewd questions, causing
him to chip away practically
all the meaning from his earli-
er statements. That leaves
many people, including me,
who were enthusiastic about
his first press conferences,
doubtful about where Eisen-
hower stands on anything.

Something seems to be hap-
pening in Colorado that
strongly suggests those sad
days in the summer of 1940
when Wendell Willkie, also in
Colorado, day by day talked
himself out of the Presidency.
The only difference is that
Willkie was in Colorado
Springs and Eisenhower is in
Denver. The pattern is the
same.
