Democrats May Batten
on the GOP Farm Plank
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
CUT BANK, Mont. —Ap-
parently the forces of the
Democratic Party that are
centered in the Truman-Bran-
nan Department of Agricul-
ture, together with the more
radical farm groups, are pre-
pared to make a major attack
on the agricultural provisions
in the new Republican plat-
form. It will be well for Re-
publican candidates and ora-
tors to prepare for this. For
that is how Truman in 1948
succeeded in winning the elec-
tion.
The disposition of certain
farm groups to exploit Social-
istic doctrines has been quite
evident to me in my journey
from Chicago through the
Northwest. In Minnesota,
which has generally leaned to-
ward those doctrines for many
years, there is already much
talk of "reactionary Repub-
lican farm policies." It must
also be remembered that the
Socialist Brannan plan prob-
ably originated among wild-
eyed radicals in the Dakotas.
The agricultural provisions
of the Republican platform are
by far the most complete and
the fairest that any party has
proposed for many years.
They seem to me to be in line
with the policies of the larger
and the more reasonable farm
groups. The American Farm
Bureau Federation under the
leadership of Allan Kline has
constantly cautioned the farm-
er to be wary of any policies
which tend to place the farmer
at the mercy of a paternalistic
government. At the last an-
nual meeting of the Farm Bu-
reau Federation, resolutions
were adopted which include
the following language:
"The fundamental basis for
farm and national prosperity
lies in freedom of opportunity
and the constant striving of
individuals to improve what is
already good. The contrary
philosophy of governmental
paternalism leads to economic
stagnation.
"Farm price supports are
an appropriate and necessary
protection against unreason-
able price declines. It is not,
however, the responsibility of
the government to guarantee
profitable prices to any eco-
nomic group.
"We favor the maintenance
of the present price support
features of the Agricultural
Act of 1949 which are designed
to provide protection against
extreme price declines with-
out going to the opposite ex-
treme of government price fix-
ing. We do not believe that
action to raise the level of
price support above that now
provided in the Agricultural
Act of 1949 is in the long-run
interest of farm people.
"Government payments to
farmers are not a desirable
substitute for price supports
or a satisfactory means of
bringing income into agri-
culture."
Gen. Eisenhower and his
fellow candidates this year
will do well to heed this
evidence of sanity among
farmers. They will be well
advised to let the radical farm
leaders stay where they have
been for more than 20 years—
in the Democratic fold.
