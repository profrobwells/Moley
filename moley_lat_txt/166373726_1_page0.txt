REQUIRED READING

If this election is to be a
Republican victory the deci-
sive arguments must come
from many sources. They can-
not come from Candidate Ei-
senhower alone. In fact, the
election must be won for and
not by him. He can offer as-
sets of great value: his attrac-
tive personality, his integrity,
his belief in American ideals
and his proven capacity as an
administrator. But the words
that move people to vote this
present regime out of office
must come from others.
The task of the many, many
people who are carrying on
the campaign over the country
will be to present the argu-
ments necessary to convince
people to vote for a change.
They will need plenty of ma-
terial for that purpose.
One of the best available
sources for that is the signifi-
cant speeches of Herbert
Hoover in these eventful years
since 1941 when the tragic con-
ditions which the country now
faces were shaping them-
selves. The Updegraff Press of
Scarsdale, New York, has just
published those speeches in a
form that will enable workers
and voters to marshal their
arguments with quickness and
efficiency. The book is entitled
"Forty Key Questions About
Our Foreign Policy Answered
by Herbert Hoover."

The right of Hoover to ex-
press the sentiments of mil-
lions of Republicans on for-
eign policy cannot be denied,
although a faction of the party
is in disagreement. Neverthe-
less, there is agreement on the
vital necessity of change and
unless those who favor the
point of view of Hoover be-
come vital workers and loyal
voters we shall have no
change. For you cannot beat
a whole party with half a par-
ty.
It is especially important to
have the views of Hoover,
MacArthur and others articu-
lated, because for a very im-
portant personal reason Eisen-
hower cannot sharply draw
the issue of foreign policy.
That personal reason is his
former association with Gen.
George Marshall. Very recent-
ly Gen. Marshall stated, in ef-
fect, that both Candidates Ste-
venson and Eisenhower were
his boys.

The evidence is quite clear
that the elevation of Eisen-
hower in World War II was
not due to Roosevelt but to
Marshall. The President mere-
ly followed the judgment of
Marshall.
That fact would prevent Ei-
senhower from striking at the
vital decisions in which Mar-
shall had such a great part. It
silences the Republican candi-
date on the major issue of how
China was turned over to the
Communists.
For that reason it is impor-
tant not only to have Hoover's
views presented but to bring
all factions of the Republican
Party to realize that, regard-
less of differences, there
should be unity on the subject
of change.
This book presents the Hoo-
ver case, a case in which mil-
lions will join in agreement.
