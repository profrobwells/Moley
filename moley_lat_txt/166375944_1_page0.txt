Good-by to All Ghosts,
and Good Riddance, Too
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In another column I carried
the story of Eisenhower's wise
decision in Detroit to speak
without benefit of ghosts and
helpers.
It seems that his inexperienced
advisers had loaded him
up with several drafts of
speeches foolishly assuming
that a man as busy as he is
could possibly reduce them all
in a few hours into a coherent
discourse for a major occasion.
Apparently two of these
were written by people utterly
inexperienced in politics.
The other was by a man who
wrote speeches in three unsuccessful
campaignsâ€”campaigns
lost, it may be added,
because of the poor quality of
the candidates' utterances.
This in itself was a dreadful
situation for a man whose
reputation and destiny were
resting largely upon the success
or failure of that particular
speech, which was sufficiently
important to justify
the expenditure of $130,000 of
his campaign money.
To show further how utterly
incompetent some of these
managers are it should be
added that one of them a few
days before asked a man whom
I know to recommend a
speech writer for Eisenhower.
Now you don't reach out and
grab an adviser or literary
assistant on that short notice,
like hiring a plumber to fix a
leaky sink.
The important thing is that
ghost writing is a discredited
and ineffective method of political
campaigning. A proper
method of assisting a public
man with his speeches bears
no resemblance to such fakery.
An explanation of that statement
will not only illuminate
the method that should be followed
but perhaps answer a
question that some of my
readers may have concerning
my own participation in the
first Roosevelt campaign. It
was a million times removed
from merely writing a speech
for another. The method then
developed I have not only described
myself before this, but
is well told in the recent book
by Samuel I. Rosenman,
"Working with Roosevelt."
Rosenman worked with Roosevelt
when he was Governor
and then resumed after the
first four years in Washington
and continued to the end.
Both of us can testify to the
long days and weeks that went
into an important speech and
the contribution that Roosevelt
himself made. The acceptance
speech in 1932 was
sketched by me over two
months before we knew whether
Roosevelt would be nominated.
Then I went over it
time and again with him adding,
subtracting, changing.
Then he and Rosenman went
over and over the draft.
One of the fantastic stories
of the time was that Roosevelt
wrote it in the plane flying
to Chicago. In fact, it represented
the hard labor of
three experienced people over
a period of nearly three
months.
The Roosevelt agricultural
speech delivered in September
of that year contained the contributions
of 25 people and
Roosevelt himself went over
and over it with me. So when
he finally made a speech it not
only represented his own convictions
but in phraseology
and the like it was, regardless
of contributions by others,
really a part of him. That is
the way a public man should
employ assistance.
But since these Eisenhower
managers have labored under
the mistaken impression that
speeches can be mass produced
like tomato cans there is only
one thing the general can do.
Go it alone. What he loses in
finish and content he will
make up in sincerity. And the
public will like it.
And so, with Taft, always
on his own, and with Ike on
his own, good-by and good
riddance to ghosts.
