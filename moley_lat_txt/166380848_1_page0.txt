DEADLOCK
IN KOREA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
SANTA BARBARA—In my
previous column I outlined the
problems that are vexing Gen.
Harrison and the United Na-
tions representative who are
trying to create an armistice
in the Korean war.
As I noted then, my infor-
mation was given me by an
officer who assisted Adm. Joy
for months and who has re-
cently returned to California.
I shall continue my questions
to him and set down the
answers in the officer’s own
words.
“You mentioned, in one of
your previous answers the
fact that in the earlier part of
these conferences you were
negotiating from strength.
Would you expand upon the
points of negotiating from
strength and weakness?”
*
“In the early days of the negotiations, the U.N. forces
were on the move. The enemy
was taking severe losses. He
was in a mood to seek relief
from further punishment. The
U.N. delegation was in a
position to force the enemy to
come to terms.
“However, after the military
demarcation line was agreed
upon, pressure on the North
Korean and Chinese armies relaxed substantially. U.N.
troops dug in along the battle
line. It was apparently hoped
that an early armistice could
be realized, and it was felt
that a continuation of the offensive along the line would
result in futile bloodshed.
“This was a turning point in
the negotiatory position of our
delegation. In November the
Communists became more obstinate in their stands on issues
concerning inspection and
limitation on increase of
military potential during the
armistice. Then came the most
trying point in the negotiations—that of the exchange of
prisoners of war.”
★
“Please explain briefly a little
of the background of that
issue.”
“The United Nations over
many months of conflict captured more than 100,000 enemy
troops. We have on our hands
many thousands who are desperately opposed to returning
to North Korea and to
Communist China.
“During hostilities U.N. psychological warfare has persuaded many enemy troops to
surrender. North Korean and
Chinese troops who do not choose
to return to their native lands
have indicated that they will
violently oppose repatriation,
and surely a great number of
them would find themselves in
grave danger of losing their
lives if they returned. Consequently, the U.N. command has
stood firm on the principle of no
forced repatriation.”
★
“Why are the Communists
opposed to the United Nations’
proposal on prisoners of war?”
“Should the Communists accept our principle of no forced
repatriation, they would lose
considerable face in the Orient. This, I feel, is the most
important reason for their unwillingness to accept our proposal.
“There is, of course, the possibility that the North Koreans
and Chinese are under Soviet
pressure to prolong hostilities,
but I believe that we can achieve
an armistice if we apply sufficient
pressure upon the enemy. We
cannot, and I’m sure we will not,
abandon our stand on no forced
repatriation.”
In my next column I shall
continue this discussion of the
Korean situation.
