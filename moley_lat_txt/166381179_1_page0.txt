As the important meetings
of the Republican National
Committee open, the evidence
all points to a heavy Taft ad-
vantage.
That of course is no sure
sign that he will be nominated.
After discounting both the
Taft and Eisenhower esti-
mates on the grounds of wish-
ful thinking and propaganda,
there is a disparity of about
a hundred between them. But
Taft has a number of serious
though perhaps not fatal weak-
nesses. The delegates com-
mitted to candidates other
than the two leading contend-
ers will in large part be for
Eisenhower after a ballot or
two.
The great fear largely de-
veloped by anti-Taft propagan-
da, that the Senator cannot
win, weighs heavily upon the
undecided. Finally there is the
fact noted by many a shrewd
observer that Taft has already
lost two contests for the nomi-
nation. There is therefore no
tradition of Taft invincibility.
However, the history of
those two unsuccessful, at-
tempts does not lend support
to any theory that Taft's sup-
porters are fair weather
friends. His record shows that
his delegates have been re-
markably durable.
In 1940, Taft had 189 on the
first ballot. Dewey was leading
with 360. Willkie had only 105,
while 76, were for Vandenberg.
On the second ballot Taft
moved up to 203. Willkie also
gained while Dewey and Van-
denberg lost. On the third,
Taft gained some more while
Dewey lost. On the fourth
Dewey lost very heavily while
Willkie moved up to first place
with 306 and Taft followed
with 254.
On the fifth, Dewey's sup-
port melted away to 57. Van-
denberg to 42, with Willkie
moving up to 429. But Taft
moved ahead some more to
317.
On the sixth and final ballot,
which was the critical test of
Taft's delegates. Willkie won
but Taft's people stood firm
with 310. Thus the Taft
strength showed remarkable
staying power. And this was
the more remarkable because
it was clear that if the Willkie
managers won they would give
small consideration to those
who stood out to the end.
In 1948, Dewey again started
with a big advantage. He had
434. Taft followed with 224.
Stassen had 157 and Vanden-
berg 62. It was evident that
Dewey had great secondary
strength that time. He revealed
some of it on the second ballot
when he jumped to 515. But
Taft gained 50 votes to 271.
Stassen lost ground. On the
third the entire Dewey
strength came out and the
Taft people threw in the towel.
We cannot draw many con-
clusions from this history but
two or three are permissible.
The first is that Taft in nei-
ther year started with his full
strength. If that is his policy,
it may be assumed that he
will not collapse if he fails to
win on the first ballot this
year. Skillful managers, and
no one doubts the ability of
some of Taft's, like to have a
little room to maneuver.
That slack is provided by a
batch of delegates who are
committed but who vote for
someone else on the first hal-
lot. For nothing is so chilling
to a candidate's chances as to
lose ground on the second bal-
lot.
Nothing can be certain in
this situation but I would
venture to guess that if the
Taft people are not absolute-
ly sure of a majority with
some votes to spare on
the first ballot, they will not
show their full strength then.
Another most important in-
ference I have already stated.
That is, Taft's supporters fol-
low the words of a song of
the Senator's alma mater:
"Fight, fight with all your
might."
Without unduly complicat-
ing this discussion I wish to
add another observation.
There will be little room to
maneuver this year. The com-
mitted delegates other than
those for the major candidates
are very few.
Therefore, there is not much
chance for a deadlock this
year. Deadlocks come when
there are at the outset at least
three strong contenders as in
the Republican conventions
of 1920 and 1940. This may
be a rather quick and decisive
victory for either Taft or
Eisenhower.
