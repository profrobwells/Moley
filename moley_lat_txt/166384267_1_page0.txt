WHO VOTES
AND WHY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Of all human activities it is
probable that more mysteries
and fallacies prevail in our
knowledge of who votes and
why. And this fact is the more
remarkable because everyone
knows a little about it and
many people have spent their
lives in its study.

At the moment a sharp controversy is going on in the
public prints and elsewhere which admirably illustrates
my point. It centers in a statement by Sen. Taft that if the
Republican Party can get
8,000,000 more people to vote
than in 1948 it will win the
election.

I can agree with that statement although the Senator is
underestimating the number
of eligibles who did not vote
in 1948. He puts the number
at 35,000,000. My figure, which
is estimated on the basis of
the census figures of people
over 21 minus those who are
barred from voting, is over
42,000,000. Of these, 20,000,000
are outside the Solid South.
But let us accept either Taft's
figures or mine and consider
the merits of this controversy
about where the Republicans
must look to get their majority.

Taft is assailed by people
who argue as follows:

*

"Taft's claim that the non-
voters are a great untapped
reservoir of Republicanism is
an illusion. Quite the contrary,
the bulk of the qualified non-
voters who might be induced
to go to the polls are predominantly the very people
who by their position and their
interests are disposed to the
New Deal. The Republicans, therefore, have no prospect
of winning unless they
can break into the Democratic
majority which Roosevelt
brought together."

The solution for a Republican
victory proposed by the
people who argue in that way
is to make the Republican
candidate and platform so
much like the Democratic
candidate and platform that
two or more million who voted
for Truman in 1948, perhaps by mistake, vote Republican.

*

There is a triple fallacy in
this attempt to brand Taft's
argument as a fallacy.

1—No one in his right mind
can assume that Taft is so
stupid a politician as to suggest that Republican workers
reach blindly into a bag of
nonvoters and draw out the
necessary millions. He means
that Republican workers
should do exactly what the
CIO-PAC has always done, on
its side. Republicans should
get out the vote favorable to
the Republican side. There is
plenty of evidence that there
are many millions of such potential voters.

2—Therefore, to say that
"the bulk of the qualified non-
voters" are not likely to vote
Republican is probably true
but wholly irrelevant to the
issue. That is like telling a
minister that he should not
try to get new members for
his church because most people will not go to church
under any conditions, or like a
woman who says that she will
never marry because most
men are not worth marrying.
The reason given for the statement has no relation to the
statement itself.

3—Another absurdity is inherent in the last of the quoted
statements above. It is this:
If the proper course is to go
over into the ranks of those
who voted for Truman and
convert Fair Dealers who
cared enough for their opinion
to take the trouble to vote,
why would it not be easier to
tackle those indifferent Fair
Dealers who did not take the
trouble to vote?

*

Behind all this nonsense is
the great independent voter
myth. I have already dealt
with that in an earlier column,
but those who want to read an
excellent treatment of the subject should read a little book
just published by James L.
Wick entitled "How Not to
Run for President."

The Taft thesis is right.
Never mind the 21,000,000 who
voted for Truman in 1948.
Shop for the necessary majority among the 42,000,000 who
did not vote in 1948, plus the
extra millions who have come
of age since. But use discrimination. Don't just "get out the
vote." Get out the right votes.
