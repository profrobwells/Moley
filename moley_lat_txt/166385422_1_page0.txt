TAFT DOES WHAT'S
EXPECTED OF HIM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It will serve the interests
of truth, although not the
cause of partisan politics, to
note that Sen. Taft is doing
exactly what many eastern Re-
publicans vowed, before the
convention, that they would
not do. He is supporting the
choice of the convention.
In the feverish days of May
and June the eastern sea-
board rang with the voices of
Republicans saying "if Taft
is nominated, I'll vote for Tru-
man" (or "I will not vote." or
something of the same nature).
Meanwhile, everyone knew
what Taft would do, win or
lose. It is not in the Taft tradi-
tion to be mean or small or dis-
loyai to the great purpose of
party government. To put this
sort of example before the
American people is one of the
two important services he has
already given to the campaign.
The second is that he has
clarified and stated the major
domestic issue in this cam-
paign. That issue is not official
corruption, although that is
very important. The issue is
the choice before the American
voters this fall between indi-
vidual liberty, guarded and
limited by law, and the domi-
nance of the Federal govern-
ment in human affairs. Despite
the sophisticated contempt
with which Candidate Steven-
son has treated the charge of
creeping Socialism, that is the
danger and it is well properly
to name it.
Advisers of Eisenhower, es-
pecially those who have been
carried over from the two
Dewey campaigns, have not
wanted the General to mention
Socialism. They would favor
blurring over that issue com-
pletely. In fact, they are as one
with Stevenson on that point.
But now, with the full con-
currence of Eisenhower, it is
pointed up as an issue, and the
American people have a real
choice to make.
Taft's pledge of loyalty
shines with added luster on
the dark background of Sen.
Wayne Morse's petulant deci-
sion to "sit this one out." He
will "listen to the radio, watch
television and show his cat-
tle at county fairs." We shall
all hope that his cattle will be
more cordially treated than
their master deserves for him-
self. For this is not only a vio-
lation of a pledge which he
made in August but a strange
and perverted interpretation
of independence.
It is not without meaning
that Morse or, as he is known
in Oregon, Junior, was a stu-
dent at the University of Wis-
consin during the days of the
elder Bob La Follette. The
young man's admiration was
so great for that great Senator
that he planned to write a
book about him. Perhaps he
thinks that in repudiating his
pledge and his party he is
emulating La Follette's blazing
independence. But there is a
vast difference.
La Follette's breaks with his
party were on fundamental
issues of principle. Morse can
hardly claim that his repudia-
tion involves principle. Eisen-
hower has been his choice all
along. He participated as a
delegate in the convention that
nominated the General. He
voted for him and subsequent-
ly pledged his support.
But now Morse claims that
Eisenhower not only must fit
his specifications for President
but must permit him to choose
the people whose support Ei-
senhower will accept. This is
absurd.
The hard fact is that Morse
has for years manifested a bit-
terness toward Taft that can
hardly be ascribed to differ-
ences in principle. It may in
part be that this personal an-
tagonism goes back to the de-
nial to Morse of a place on
the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee of the Senate. Morse at-
tributed that denial to Taft.
And it may be ascribed to
Taft's brusque way of treating
Morse's windy and pointless
oratorical excursions.
In any event, Morse has per-
mitted a personal rancor to
frustrate what might have
been a very promising career.
The Republican Party will
probably worry along without
the junior Senator's support.
