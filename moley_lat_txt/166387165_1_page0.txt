Republican leaders have
often reminded me of the man
who took to his bed because
a number of his friends told
him he looked ill.
Beginning with Roosevelt
in 1934, Democratic leaders
have accused them of appro-
priating New Deal reforms
but promising to administer
them better. Democrats as-
sumed, in making this argu-
ment, that since the early
New Deal reforms were enact-
ed by a Democratic Congress
and President, they thus
earned the imprescriptible
right to carry them on.

Republicans who suggested
that they could "do them bet-
ter" were charged with gross
hypocrisy. Ultimately, Repub-
licans were silenced. Even
among themselves, those who
favored retaining the reforms
were charged with "me-too-
ism." In short, Democratic
propaganda prevailed, and the
Republicans lost an issue that
might have brought their de-
liverance sooner.
It is time now to stand up
in meeting and reassert the
truth that those new activities
of government adopted by the
New Deal can be done better,
should be done better, and
that the new regime proposes
as its major objective to do
them better.
The way a thing is done is a
matter of major importance.
It determines whether the
thing is worth doing. It is
a matter not merely of form
but of substance or, if you
will, it is a case where form
becomes a matter of sub-
stance.
Take old age security as an
example. The objective is to
provide security for those
who have been unable to pro-
vide it for themselves. This
security can, in part at least,
be paid for in taxes over the
years by the beneficiaries.
But under the present meth-
od of administration the sys-
tem is a deceptive form of se-
curity. Its financial methods
are open to grave question. Its
application is inequitable. Ul-
timately, under the present
system, the so-called fund or
reserve will be bankrupt and
the government will have to
make contributions from cur-
rent income. The task of hon-
est fiscal authorities is to re-
organize and rationalize this
system.
That is one example of the
right thing being done the
wrong way. The Wagner Act
was another, until it was su-
perseded by Taft-Hartley.

The greatest service this
new administration and newly
elected Congress can per-
form will be to overhaul a
whole series of laws and ad-
ministrative practices. Life al-
ways outruns the law. Con-
stant revision is essential. No
establishment of government
and no administrative prac-
tices are sacrosanct.
Let this administration
tackle the prosaic task of put-
ting the house in order. That
will not be as spectacular as a
big fire and a rebuilding. But
it will be a better house and it
will be less expensive.
All hail to those who would
"do it better."
