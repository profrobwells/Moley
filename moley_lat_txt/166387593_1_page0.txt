The Morsocratic Party;
It Needs a Satirist
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is truly a pity that some
great master of satirical writ-
ing like the author of "Can-
dide" is not available to de-
scribe the amazing case of
Wayne Morse, junior Sena-
tor from the State of Oregon.
are hardly able to give the
story its deserved bizarre
background, its farcical se-
quences, and its droll infer-
ences. Our writings will per-
ish with sunset.
If, as the Senator undoubt-
edly believes, the case be-
longs to the history of con-
stitutional liberty, those who
write of that will hardly give
the incident a footnote. The
whole matter will sink into
the dusty silence of Congres-
sional annals. But if anyone
cares, he will find the materi-
al in the Congressional Rec-
ord of Tuesday, Jan. 13, 1953.
As most everyone knows
by this time, Wayne Morse
was elected to the Senate in
1944 from Oregon on the Re-
publican ticket. He was re-
elected on the same ticket in
1950. He has held committee
assignments during his serv-
ice as a Republican. In elec-
tion campaigns he has made
speeches for the Republican
Party in Oregon and in many
other places.

He has, however, harbored
an abiding antipathy toward
Sen. Taft. The emergence of
the Eisenhower candidacy of-
fered Morse a splendid oppor-
tunity for valiant political
activity, since it was directed
against the Senator from
Ohio. After the convention,
in which Morse sat as a dele-
gate, the Senator expressed
dissent from the Republican
platform. But for the time
he seemed to accept the tick-
et.
After the Taft-Eisenhow-
er conference in September,
however, Morse exploded
with all the pyrotechnics
available to a man so ex-
perienced in the art of blow-
ing up. He announced his
"resignation" from the Re-
publican Party and was
eagerly welcomed as an ora-
tor by a hard-pressed Steven-
son management.
But once the campaign was
over, Morse's position was
anomalous and awkward.
The Democratic Party had
nothing to offer. In fact,
Democrats seemed to lose in-
terest in him completely.
And Republican feelings
were a compound of bitter-
ness and contempt.
On Jan. 13 the leaders of
the two parties, Sens. John-
son of Texas and Taft of
Ohio, presented the names of
the Senators each party was
assigning to committees. In
so doing, Johnson said that
it was traditionally the duty
of the majority party to as-
sign Senators who were "not
of either party." Thus Morse,
the eagerly accepted volun-
teer in the campaign, was
gently laid on the lap of the
party from which he came.
The Republican committee
list made provision for Morse
by leaving spaces vacant on
the Committees of the Dis-
trict of Columbia and on Pub-
lic Works. But Morse assert-
ed his right to be appointed
to the Committees on Armed
Services and on Labor and
Public Welfare.
*
This Taft on behalf of the
Republican majority refused,
on the ground that by doing
so his party would lose con-
trol of two of the most vital-
ly important committees of
the Senate. This prepared
the way for the almost in-
credible assertion by Morse
that he was in himself a
third party. He said:
"I stand before the Senate,
not as a member of either the
Republican Party or the
Democratic Party, but as an
Independent. Third parties
are not new in this great na-
tion but some have served
high purposes . . . I stand
alone in this chamber as a
representative of the inde-
pendents."
Of course, no so-called "in-
dependents" selected him as
their representative, nor is
it possible to describe what
an "Independent" believes in,
but Morse by his "Independ-
ence" says that he becomes
a one-man political party. All
the word means is that Morse
is not a Republican or a Dem-
ocrat. But by this detachment
he demands recognition as a
party on all fours with the
two parties, each of which
polled millions of votes.
That is what confronts the
Senate, and the determina-
tion of the issue is still to
be made.
