The, co-operative action of
Eisenhower as Chief Execu-
tive and Taft as the real as
well as nominal leader of the
Senate will mean much more
than a mere return to a Re-
publican Party government.
It will mean a restoration of
that co-ordination planned
and intended by the makers
of the Constitution of the Unit-
ed States. It foreshadows a
restoration of the balance be-
tween the executive and the
legislative branches of govern-
ment.
This matter of co-ordinate
responsibility in our govern-
ment is not just a generality
written into the school books
of our children. It is a vital
element in the maintenance
of our liberty. A President
unchecked would, even in the
United States, become a dic-
tator. A Congress uncurbed
would degenerate into oli-
garchy.
*
The people who made the
Constitution were aware of
these dangers and, with a real-
istic eye to the weaknesses of
human nature, carefully bal-
anced the potential selfishness
of the two branches of govern-
ment against each other.
The two persons from Con-
gress who can speak with au-
thority for the majority of
that body are the majority
leader of the Senate and the
Speaker of the House. The
Vice-President is a figurehead,
neither chosen by nor respon-
sible to the Senate over which
he presides.
The truly responsible officers
of the majority of the next
Senate, apart from committee
chairmen, will be the major-
ity leader and the chairman of
the Policy Committee. The se-
lection of Taft for one of these
and of Knowland for the other
recognizes the realities of
prestige, capacity and right.

With Martin and Taft to
deal with, Eisenhower will
have the benefit of advice un-
tainted by even the slightest
degree of self-interest or per-
sonal dependence. Both were
firmly established long before
the General became a political
figure. Both can speak with
authority for their majorities
in the Congress.
This will be as the Consti-
tution contemplated. It will be
a resumption of Congressional
independence after at least 18
years. For after the tremen-
dous Democratic victory in the
Congressional election of 1934
members of Congress on the
Democratic side began to feel
that all they needed to do was
to rubber-stamp the Roosevelt
wishes. Independence did not
begin to reassert itself in the
Senate until the court fight in
1937. It never recovered in the
House. The Speakers in the pe-
riod since 1935 have been
Joseph W. Byrne, William B.
Bankhead and, since 1940 (ex-
cept during the 80th Congress),
Sam Rayburn.

The latter has represented a
complete subordination of the
House leadership to the White
House. Rayburn has apparent-
ly conceived himself to be the
President's ambassador to the
House (however extraordinary
you may choose, but certainly
not plenipotentiary). Great
Speakers of the past were, as
the Constitution contemplated,
ambassadors from the House
to the President.
Alben Barkley's subservi-
ence to the Presidents during
his service as majority leader
and Vice-President represents
the same sort of decline of
Senate independence.
The era of Taft and Martin
as representatives of the Con-
gress in dealings with the
President will represent a re-
turn to true constitutional
procedure. It will mean
equality, with co-operation be-
tween the two branches of
our Federal government.
