WHO ARE
'WE'?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is a matter of significance
that Gov. Stevenson used the
personal pronoun "we" 56
times in his Columbus speech
extolling the welfare state.
The use of "we" is an alto-
gether familiar characteristic
of the advocates of the Federal
welfare state. Perhaps the
most prodigious user of this
pronoun has been the First
Lady of the Land, Emeritus.
Henry Wallace is another "we-
er." Those eminent uplifters
of the poor and benighted
have been at it a long time,
much longer than Adlai Ste-
venson has been in public life.
But give him time, for his
mentality and attitude toward
the rest of struggling human-
ity mark him as the perfect
dispenser of that word.
The word as used by these
sponsors of the welfare state
generally means that "we" are
doing things for them-not
with them. It is the language
of a guardian, not of a com-
panion.
But in the trickery of the
Stevenson language, the word
is used to mean many things.
Grammatically, it has many
antecedents. It is designed to
lead the hearer or reader to at-
tribute many things only to
the benign actions of the poli-
ticians in power.

Among the 56 "we's" in the
Stevenson speech, the ante-
cedents of the pronoun are
(1) the Democratic regime in
Washington over the last 20
years, including, presumably,
both the executive department
and the Democrats in Con-
gress; (2) the American people
generally; (3) the government
of Illinois, including the Demo-
cratic Governor and the mixed
Legislature. Sometimes Ste-
venson seems to suggest the
editorial use of "we," meaning
Stevenson himself.
As I count them, about three
of the 56 "we's" refer to the
Governor and Legislature of
Illinois. One seems to mean
the generality of the people
of Illinois. The rest are about
equally divided between the
American people and the Dem-
ocratic Party.
But such is the slickness
with which "we's" are shifted
that it is almost impossible to
tell whether a great social im-
provement is due to the Roose-
velt, Truman administrations
or to the millions of others who
have toiled here for two or
three centuries trying to build
a better life. For the Steven-
son tongue and pen are quick-
er than the ordinary mortal's
hand or eye.

Of course, he places a great
burden upon our credulity
when he claims Democratic
Party credit for many things
that came through persons
and circumstances quite re-
mote from any political group.
For example, according to the
prepared text, he said: "We
(the Democratic Party) have
banished the hand pump, the
outdoor privy, the kerosene
lamps."
The Old Guard, of course,
according to Stevenson,
fought such improvement im-
placably.
But did Messrs. Truman and
Roosevelt really achieve those
revolutionary changes? It
seems to me that Thomas A.
Edison had a hand in the
third of those banishments.
And, according to Lytton Stra-
chey, it was that Elizabethan
courtier, wit and poet Sir
John Harington who paved
the way for the second by his
invention, which he presented
to the Queen.
We should give credit where
credit is due. By "we," I mean
all of us.
