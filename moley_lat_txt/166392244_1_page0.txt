Candidate Eisenhower
Faces Tough Decisions
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Now it is all over. There
is the ticket and the platform
and the customary strained ex-
pressions of reconciliation by
both sides.
I should be serving those
who choose to read this piece
very badly if I filled the space
with platitudes about how ev-
erybody must be happy and
rush to the aid of the party.
It would also be quite useless
to recount the errors of strat-
egy that lost the Taft cause
or the not too nice tactics
that marred the actions of the
victors. What we all need to
do is to take a hard look at
the problems that lie ahead
for the successful ticket.

In the first place, all the re-
nowned capacity of Gen. Ei-
senhower to reconcile the ir-
reconcilable will be needed to
build a victorious party out of
these bitterly antagonistic fac-
tions.
Perhaps the hard words that
were said, some of which the
General himself uttered, will
be forgotten. In politics the
survival of the thickest skins
makes it fairly easy to forgive
and forget. But it will be some
time before devoted Taft fol-
lowers can feel happy again
after being accused of steal-
ing.
The difficulty will be com-
pounded by the fact that as
the contest proceeded the cru-
saders who uttered those
cries showed an amazing pro-
ficiency at taking delegates
that did not belong to them
and to overwhelm the convic-
tions of others by threats of
pain and ruin.

If the General could have
taken some sort of disguise
and had walked through the
streets of Chicago after the
nomination he would have
found solemn faces on most
Republicans. For Chicago was
a Taft city in a Taft State.
And what is true of Chicago
prevails over a considerable
area in this country.
Taft himself will give the
best he has, but confidence
cannot come back to these
people except through the ef-
forts of Eisenhower. He can-
not do the job merely by talk-
ing about party unity and the
spirit of victory. He must do
and say things in which those
Taft people can have confi-
dence and which conform with
their honest convictions.
That is not going to be easy
for Gen. Eisenhower because
he has little experience in
this sort of public life and for
some years his contact with
the generality of the people
in this country has been only
occasional and casual.
Moreover, as a full fledged
nominee he labors under a
handicap that few people in
his position have faced before.
Almost always a nominee
comes to the task of a cam-
paign with assistants and man-
agers of his own choosing and
with whom he has worked for
a long time. So it was with
McKinley and Wilson and
Harding and Franklin Roose-
velt.
Eisenhower must pick
among a variegated group
which supported his candidacy
before his return or among
people with whom he has had
very little contact. And those
people can make or break him
as a candidate.

I heard from a man close to
the Eisenhower group that a
certain person had been picked
for the chairmanship of the
national committee. The per-
son mentioned happened to
have delivered his State dele-
gation in large part to the Gen-
eral. When I raised the ques-
tion of this man's competence
for the job I was told that a
choice must be made between
"consistency" and "party
unity."
The meaning attached to the
word "consistency" was mem-
bership and regularity in the
Eisenhower movement. If that
is to be the case this campaign
must be conducted by a faction
of the Republican Party, not
by the party as a whole. And
it must be remembered that
the party as a whole is a min-
ority party at the moment.
A prominent person in the
Eisenhower movement has
been quoted as saying that in
this campaign "we don't need
any Taft people." That is not
the sort of spirit that leads to
victory.
Gen. Eisenhower must make
these vital decisions of course
after consultation with many
people. But ultimately he must
make them himself. He can-
not permit Gov. Dewey or any-
one else to make them for him.
And his decisions will deter-
mine the outcome in Novem-
ber.
