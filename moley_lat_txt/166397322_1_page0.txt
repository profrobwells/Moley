Democrats Are Willing
to Stand on Their 'Gains'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
One of the great ironies of
political life is the fact that
when certain ends are attained
by aggressive action the public
satisfaction that results re-
acts violently against those
who promoted the action. That
is a pretty clumsy sentence
and, lest I be accused of emu-
lating the involutions of Elea-
nor Roosevelt, let me hurry
with my illustrations.

For years, labor leaders kept
themselves in power by work-
ing to get more pay for their
members. But the Taft elec-
tion in Ohio in 1930 showed
that when those members had
thus attained the status of
medium or above-medium in-
come people they refused to
continue to vote as their labor
bosses told them. Their votes
showed a growing conserva-
tism.
The recent Democratic con-
vention indicated quite clearly
an overwhelming desire of the
delegates to coast along with
present "gains," rather than
to clamor for more reform.
The rush to Stevenson was a
vote of confidence in things as
they are and a vote of no con-
fidence in further change. The
delegates reasoned: So long as
prosperity prevails and they
could claim credit for it, why
stir things up by agitating for
more reform?
★
Realizing that they could
only defeat themselves by
driving the South to revolt,
they so modified their civil
rights stand that it is now
hardly distinguishable from
that of the Republicans.
Back before the outbreak of
the war in 1933, there were
evidences of discontent among
important Democrats over the
rate of reform, and Roosevelt
clearly welcomed the onset
of international complication
to say farewell to the New
Deal.
But after the war, with a
President who wanted to have
a New Deal all his own and in
his own image, the radicals
again had their day. With this
revival of reform came a
virulent type of demagoguery,
at which President Truman
became a masterful practi-
tioner. Now that, too, has lost
its savor.
The real politicians, as dis-
tinguished from the lunatic
fringe, want to stay in power
on any terms. There is no
doubt about the basic radical-
ism of Kefauver, and hence
the radicals wanted him for
either spot on the ticket. Har-
riman was merely talking like
Truman to get his support.
His tall talk was wholly insin-
cere. Nothing in the past rec-
ord of this former Wall Street
banker indicated any burning
passion for submerged races
or unfilled stomachs.
★
And so, as soon as it was
clear that Truman was un-
willing or unable to give him
his blessing and no doubt at
the order of the real owner of
the New York delegation, Ed-
ward J. Flynn of the Bronx,
he rushed to the Stevenson
bandwagon, leaving his erst-
while collaborator bleeding on
the field.
And so the authentic New
and Fair Dealers are the old
guard, with nowhere to go ex-
cept to follow the party which
they failed to capture. The
labor bosses, however, are in-
dispensable to Stevenson, and
we shall see before many
weeks that he will speak lan-
guage agreeable to their pur-
poses.
The situation offers an op-
portunity to Eisenhower and
Republicans to put forth a
really constructive but con-
servative alternative to this
Democratic Party that is nei-
ther one thing nor another.
We shall see how well that al-
ternative case is presented.
