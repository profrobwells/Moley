Our Votes Are for Sale,
According to Truman
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The deal that was consum-
mated by President Truman
and John L. Lewis is about as
barefaced a bargain as has
been recorded in American
history. Truman's action re-
flects not only the cynical
materialism of his political
philosophy but the gross
hypocrisy of his efforts to
curb inflation.
It is worthy of special study
because it clearly explains
how Truman has already at-
tained political success and
anticipates electing Gov.
Stevenson as a climax and
grand finale in his career.
John L. Lewis is a realist.
He has in the past given his
political support in return for
monetary benefits for his
miners. In this instance, he
makes no bones about why he
agreed to order his miners
back to work. He did so be-
cause he was satisfied that the
President would compel the
Wage Stabilization Board to
reverse itself and grant the
full $1.90 wage increase.
★
The only reason there has
been any delay is that Lewis
was willing to give Truman a
few days not only to contrive
a plausible way to bring
about the reversal but to al-
low the President to finish off
his remaining political speech-
es. The miners will get the in-
crease all right, and the in-
crease will be paid in full from
the date of the deal.
Economic Stabilization Ad-
ministrator Roger L. Putnam
said at first that the so-called
adjustment would take at least
eight days. He said that on
Monday, and is I figure it
eight days meant not before
the day after election. Then
Putnam realized his break
and said maybe "tomorrow or
a week from some Thursday."
The hypocrisy of putting
the increase in escrow is
clear. The denial of the in-
crease was on the ground of
checking inflation. But when
the extra pay is put in es-
crow, the price must go up
just as it would if the money
went to the miners. The dam-
age is done.
Once more, the President
acknowledges his servility to
the union bosses. Once more,
he breaks his line against in-
flation,
★
But what ought to be
stressed is that once more the
President has indicated that
his philosophy of politics
holds that every man has his
price and that ideals and spir-
itual values are matters for
preachers and professors to
prate about.
His speeches reek with this
low appraisal of the voters. It
expresses itself in the slogan
"you never had it so good." It
is the major premise of all his
party's logic. It puts a price on
every vote. It reduces the
democratic process to the level
of a cattle auction.
Truman loves to talk about
how the Republicans are real-
ly using the Communist tech-
nique. But the basis of the
whole Marxist technique is
the materialistic nature of
politics. In this appeal there
are no spiritual values. There
are mere rationalizations of
an animal struggle for food
and power. This philosophy
has characterized the whole
Truman-Stevenson campaign.
The supreme question be-
fore us in this election is
whether we and our votes are
for sale.
