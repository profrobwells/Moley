Almost a year ago I pub-
lished a statement that if the
Republican convention should
be deadlocked by Taft and
Eisenhower a certain chain of
logic might well lead to the
selection of Sen. William
Knowland of California.
*
There were raised eyebrows
when I mentioned the idea
both in the East and in Califor-
nia. The same logic, however,
prevails now, a year later, and
the possibility is enlarged by
a number of things that have
happened since.
It seemed at that time Sen.
Taft would certainly have the
opposition of Eisenhower and
the general would be actively
supported by the Republicans
of many States in the East and
Far West. It seemed that Taft
would easily gather something
over 400 delegates and then
find the going very hard in
adding the necessary 200. It
seemed unlikely that Eisen-
hower could get the magic
number of 600 and that he
would be fought to the end by
Taft supporters. Hence the
likelihood of exasperated dele-
gates searching for somebody
to nominate who could cement
the party and win the election.
*
At such a time the logical
sequence indicated that dele-
gates looking for a way out
would find the large Califor-
nia delegation a fine center
around which to gather a ma-
jority. It seemed to me that
those delegates, who might be
classed as organization Repub-
licans, as well as the Taft
leaders, would never agree on
Warren. At such a moment
the remarkable suitability of
Knowland would appear and
Warren, who is essentially a
generous man as well as a
shrewd politician, would ac-
cept this solution and throw
his weight on the side of
winning the great prize for
his State.
It was apparent then, as it
was for some years before,
that Knowland was a loyal
Republican who thoroughly
believed in party government.
His views on domestic issues
could be regarded as moder-
ately conservative, well to the
right of Morse and Lodge and
slightly to the left of Taft. No
member of Congress had
made such an intensive study
of Far Eastern affairs. No one
had been a more effective critic
of the Truman-Marshall-Ache-
son conduct of Asiatic affairs.
Moreover Knowland had
taken a fair and moderate ap-
proach to the problem of aid
to Europe. He could not pos-
sibly be regarded by eastern
Republicans as an isolationist.
For these and other reasons it
seemed like a reasonable pos-
sibility a year ago that Know-
land might be the man.
*
The events of the last year
have added to these potentials.
First the President removed
Gen. MacArthur and thus pre-
cipitated a battle in which
Knowland played a notable
part. The entry of MacArthur
into the political arena makes
it certain that the Asiatic is-
sue will be prominent in the
campaign and there is no rea-
son why MacArthur would
not throw his support to
Knowland if it should appear
that Taft cannot make the
grade.
Finally and most important
has been the result in the
California primary on June 3.
Knowland not only swept both
primaries for the Senatorial
nomination but he piled up a
vote that was an amazing
proof of personal popularity.
In the Republican primary
he received in round numbers
1,500,000 votes, his opponent
140,000. In the Democratic pri-
mary he had 950,000, his op-
ponent 630,000. Thus he out-
distanced his opponent in all
by 1,680,000.
The immense importance of
this in California can be shown
by a comparison with War-
renâ€™s tremendous victory of
more than a million votes over
James Roosevelt in 1950.
This is not only proof that
Knowland is a tremendous
vote getter but that the issue
of administration blundering
in Asia is a bitter, vital matter
to people on the West Coast.
No Republican can carry Cal-
ifornia this year who attempts
to be lukewarm on the Mar-
shall-Acheson policy in Asia.
*
Hence the Knowland availa-
bility is a very significant
thing. And I am not referring
alone to the possibility of his
nomination for the Vice-Presi-
dency.
