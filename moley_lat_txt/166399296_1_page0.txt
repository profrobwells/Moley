Let us hope in these hopeful
holidays that our future public
servants, in these days of good
resolution, will resolve to tell
the truth. Too long, far too
long, have politicians in office
practiced cruel deceits in the
name of fine humanitarian ob-
jectives.
The need for this was force-
fully brought home to me two
weeks ago, when I had a joint
discussion on TV of Federal
old age pensions, or insurance,
or assistance whatever you
choose to call it.
★
My opponent was a high
official in the Federal Security
Agency. I had decided before
the program to adopt the role
of a sympathetic questioner
rather than critic. Fór I be-
lieve that this country is rich
enough to assure all old peo-
ple that they shall have what
they need and that the Feder-
al government has a major role
in meeting that responsibility.
Before the discussion had
ended, however, I found it
necessary to meet directly the
assumptions of my opponent.
For he followed the familiar
pattern of Fair Dealers in as-
suming, because it would be
cruel to neglect the needy,
that the Federal government
was the only means of secu-
rity; that the present law and
administrative procedures of
Social Security were excellent,
and that anyone who thought
otherwise was lacking in en-
lightenment and compassion.

To be precise, my opponent
said this in answer to my as-
sertion that the system ulti-
mately would have to be sup-
ported by general taxation:
"Why we should, as a na-
tion, undertake to develop a
program deliberately calcu-
lated to be on the degrading
side when we can maintain a
program deliberately calcu-
lated to add to the dignity of
man I am at a loss to under-
stand."
My answer to that was that
he was indulging in New Deal
semantics. In short, because I
was asserting the fact that
ultimately the system would
have to be supported by gen-
eral taxation, I was accused of
"deliberately calculating to de-
grade people, while he was "de-
liberately" aiming at the "dig-
nity of man."
But as I said at the time, I
believe that it is just as "de-
grading" to fool people as to
give them something frankly
for nothing.
For a government to neglect
its responsibility to those in
need is cruel, but to raise ex-
pectations that cannot be ful-
filled is more cruel. For the lat-
ter offends the spirit and mind
as well as the body. And those
who say that the present sys-
tem of old age insurance and
assistance is not in need of
overhauling are practicing a
cruel deceit upon the prospec-
tive beneficiaries of the sys-
tem.
I am strengthened in my
conviction on that score by
the numerous letters I have
received. Some, like the man
who telegraphed his hope that
the Lord might have mercy on
my soul and that I should read
the Sermon on the Mount,
were bitterly critical of me.
And their criticism assumed
that all was well with present
conditions and that somehow
I favored a return to the poor-
house and the breadline.

Most of the letters, however,
commended my position and
some of them presented real
examples of how badly this
present system is serving very
needy people now.
President-elect Eisenhower
has a committee whose duty it
is to suggest reorganizations
of the machinery of govern-
ment. That is good. But we
need also a firm resolve by
members of the new adminis-
tration to be frank and truth-
ful with the people.
Let the new regime begin by
a firm resolve to call things by
their right names,
