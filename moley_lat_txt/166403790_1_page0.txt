POINT OF
NO RETURN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

SANTA BARBARA—Pessi-
mism concerning an early
armistice in Korea has been
expressed very recently by
two men who should know
what they are talking about,
Gen. Van Fleet and President
Syngman Rhee of the Repub-
lic of Korea.

I have asked the officer, to
whom I referred in my two
preceding columns, about that
pessimism. He is not inclined
to share it, although he recog-
nizes the great difficulties in-
volved in the current dispute
over the return of prisoners
of war.

I quote his opinion on this
point:

"Certainly, the deadlock in
the Korean armistice negotia-
tions presents a bleak picture.
The situation could go on for
some time. The U.N. delega-
tion has taken the stand that
we will not forcibly return
prisoners to their former Com-
munist masters. This is a
principle upon which we must
stand. We have reached a
point of no return. The only
thing we can do is go for-
ward. We must force the ene-
my into accepting our terms.

"A settlement of the Ko-
rean war is, in my opinion,
within grasp and could be
realized in the near future.
Agreement on the prisoner of
war issue on U.N. terms can
be achieved through main-
tained military pressure, such
as has been exercised recent-
ly by Air Force, Navy and Ma-
rine aircraft, as well as artil-
lery and naval gunfire. Recent
raids have been of grave con-
cern to the enemy. The great
strikes against the Yalu River
power plants and against the
North Korean reservoir sys-
tems were strong blows in the
interests of peace in Korea.

"These raids have been re-
flected in the peace negotia-
tions. Senior Communist Dele-
gate Gen, Nam Il's recess
and the secret sessions re-
quested by the Communists
a few weeks ago were indica-
tive of enemy concern over
the Yalu raids. If the leaders
of the non-Communist nations
involved in the Korean con-
flict continue to turn the vise
on North Korea, an armistice
may soon be realized.

"There are no definite indi-
cations that the Korean affair
is regarded as a great mistake
by the North Koreans and the
Chinese Communists. Both
parties entertained high hopes
that their onslaughts would
subjugate South Korea. After
suffering severe losses, they
failed in their attempts. They
have been submitted to con-
siderable punishment since
their last major offensive, but
it has not been enough to per-
suade them to come to terms
in the armistice negotiations.

"We must never forget that
the Communists were desirous
of peace in Korea when the
U.N. command first met with
them at Kaesong just over a
year ago. At that time our
forces were hurting them. Al-
though the Communists are
extremely reluctant to give in
on the prisoner of war ques-
tion, they must be made to de-
sire peace now. Each day that
passes costs us dearly in men
and material. We must con-
tinue and, if necessary, step
up our pressure on the Com-
munists in North Korea. By so
doing, I believe, we will
achieve an early armistice."
