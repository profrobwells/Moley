'WITH'--NOT
'FOR'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The best advice for the
new year comes to me in a
letter from a distinguished
economist and man of busi-
ness. It is a hint for the
new administration but we
can all profit from its salty
wisdom. He says in part:
"The attitudes and the ar-
fairs of men seem to move in
broad tidal patterns, and
there has been an accumu-
lating body of evidence in
recent years that the tide is
beginning to swing away
from what might be called
statism. That is not only
true in this country but it
also is true in elections and
events in other parts of the
free world. The important
thing is, that the administra-
tion think its way through
to where the new drift is
leading us and attempt to
rationalize and direct the
movement into the most ben-
eficial patterns.

"I am inclined to feel that
it would be a mistake to in-
terpret this movement away
from statism as a movement
to, or even toward, old-fash-
ioned individualism. Certain-
ly there is room for a re-
birth of individual responsi-
bility and initiative. But the
world is too complex to ever
entertain the idea that indi-
vidualism is enough.
"Rather, I suspect that the
new movement away from
statism should be toward in-
creasing reliance upon vol-
untary associations through-
out society for the solution
of many of today's problems.
★
"Careful thought at the
community level, as well as
the State, national or even
international levels, will dis-
close effective opportunities
to meet many social needs--
needs which would otherwise
be met by government.
Whether the voluntary or-
ganization takes the form of
a business firm, a labor union,
a co-operative, a church, a
university or what not, it has
one characteristic which dif-
fers fundamentally from gov-
ernment. It must rely on co-
operation, tolerance, and un-
derstanding for its effective-
ness, whereas government
ultimately must rely on com-
pulsion.
"Here is an opportunity for
the new administration to
give positive encouragement
and direction."
★
The plans for the adminis-
tration as well as of the Con-
gress might well be tempered
to this suggestion. For gov-
ernment will find that it can-
not succeed in escaping from
the present tangle of bureauc-
racy and deficits merely by
dropping functions which it
now performs. It must help
to find ways by which serv-
ices now performed by gov-
ernment can be done by some
other agencies and at the ex-
pense of someone else. Merely
to scuttle and run will bring
resentment, political retribu-
tion and ultimate return to
statism.
We have been hearing a
lot during the last 20 years
about national planning. So-
cialists have in fact adopted
that word to screen their real
identity. But what they mean
by planning is planning for,
not planning with, people. We
shall find that it takes more
patience and time to plan
with than to plan for but the
rich reward is a restoration
of liberty.
