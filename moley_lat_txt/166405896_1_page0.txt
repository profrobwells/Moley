It is altogether too early to
determine whether President
Elsenhower individually is
going to get a good "press"
during his term. But it is not
too early to point out that
no administration as a whole
gets either a good or a bad
"press." The fact is that some
members are almost univer-
sally popular with the press
and others have a habit of
giving offense to a somewhat
overly sensitive fourth estate.
Thus, some members of an
administration are never, or
scarcely ever, criticized.
Others, it would seem, can
never do right.
That was true of the Roose-
velt and Truman regimes. It
will no doubt be true of this
one.
Robert Lovett, now ex-Sec-
retary of Defense, bore a
charmed life in the public
prints. In the war years he
carried a heavy load as Asst.
Secretary of State for Air. He
was scarcely mentioned at all
and what comment there was
favored him. Later, as Under-
secretary of State and Secre-
tary of Defense, he was prac-
tically free of complaint. Perhaps
is a genuinely able person
who is also extraordinarily
likable. Perhaps a part of the
reason is skill in managing
his publicity. Many able and
nice fellows have been driven
from Washington because
they did not know how to
deal with reporters.
Among the present novices,
George Humphrey stands out
already as an official whom
everybody seems to respect.
Charles E. Wilson, to say
it mildly, has made a bad
start. A lot has been written
about his first session with
the Senators. Some stories
have indicated that he left no
stone unthrown. At any rate,
Senatorial feathers were ruf-
fled.
Press comment on Mr.
Wilson has not derived from
his personal attitude toward
reporters or editors. It has
in the main been either a
reportorial account of the
feelings of Senators or edito-
rial comment on the merits
of his case. The latter seems
to have been fairly unani-
mous against his retention of
stock.
In Wilson's first meeting
with the Senators, Flanders
of Vermont suggested that
"the columnists" would be
eager to see a connection be-
tween Wilson and GM in his
government work. The an-
swer was: "As far as I am con-
cerned, I will tell you this,
the columnists are not going
to run the Defense Depart-
ment."
At the second meeting,
when Wilson announced his
intention to sell his stock,
he apparently recalled that
statement, saying: "Sen. Ke-
fauver brought up this ques-
tion of an explanation of
what position some of the
columnists have taken, and
I made a crack in my testi-
mony that perhaps, for the
good of all of us, ought to be
taken out, and I said flatly,
there, that the columnists
were not going to run the
Pentagon, if you put me over
there."
Anyone who has read some
of the recent comment by
gossip writers about the case
can appreciate Wilson's an-
ger and resentment. There
have been some writers un-
der by-lines who have amply
lived up to their reputation
for irresponsibility.
But it is appropriate to re-
mind Wilson that there are
columnists and columnists,
just as there are Senators
and Senators, and business-
men, too, in infinite variety.
There was Preston Tucker
in the automobile business,
as well as Charles E. Wilson.
So responsible writers for the
press specify when they
speak of businessmen. Mr.
Wilson perhaps will recog-
nize the fairness of specify-
ing when he speaks of those
people who write for the
press. There are a great many
columnists who are just as
anxious for the success of this
administration as is Mr. Wil-
son.
