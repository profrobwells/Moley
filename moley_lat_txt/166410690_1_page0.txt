Eisenhower Confounds
His Leftist Supporters
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Gen. Eisenhower in his Abi-
lene speech and his two sub-
sequent press conferences has
successfully quieted two of the
major doubts that have pre-
vented a great many people
from accepting him as a Re-
publican candidate.
The first of these quite sin-
cere doubts was that the gen-
eral might conceive himself to
be a man detached from and
above party. This doubt was
very greatly aggravated by
some of his alleged supporters
who were either confirmed
Roosevelt-Truman adherents
or socialistic Republicans.
No Republican can now hold
such a doubt after Eisenhow-
er's entirely voluntary state-
ment of his views on the es-
sential value of party govern-
ment and his own established
preference for the Republican
Party. Not only did he say that
he had voted the Republican
ticket in 1948, 1949 and 1950
when he was at Columbia Uni-
versity, but that he had never
voted "any Democratic ticket."
There is no reason to fear that
if Eisenhower is nominated
and elected we should have a
leader under whom the party
system will suffer further dis-
integration.
The other fear entertained by
reasonable and sincerely con-
servative people was that we
should have in Eisenhower an-
other pseudo-Republican mas-
querading his essential sym-
pathy for the socialistic views
of the Fair Deal under the
specious label of liberalism.
Eisenhower dissipated most
of this fear by his frank ac-
ceptance of the principles of
the Republican "Liberty vs. So-
cialism" statement of 1950.
This statement even had been
attacked at the time by the
Lodge-Dewey school of Repub-
licans. Eisenhower showed
that he not only knew exactly
what was in that statement
but that some of his ardent
supporters had not accepted it.
Nevertheless he reaffirmed his
belief in it on three distinct
occasions.
Moreover, in his specifica-
tions concerning the respon-
sibility of States in civil
rights matters, socialized medi-
cine, Federal aid to educa-
tion, taxes and foreign aid he
was specific and essentially
conservative. In some respects;
in fact, he has moved to the
right of Taft.
In fairness, this is all that
can be asked of a Republican
candidate as a starter. It is a
great deal more than was gen-
erally expected even by his
more conservative supporters.
And considering the fact that
he has not been in a position
closely to follow public affairs
in this country and has spent
his life in an entirely dif-
ferent field it has been a re-
markable performance.
The best proof of the sound
conservatism of his views has
been the reception of his ut-
terances not only by Fair
Deal Trumanites but by some
of the leftist writers who have
been trumpeting the cause of
Eisenhower for a long time.

The former have greeted
Eisenhower's statements with
jeers and denunciations.
The plight of the latter is
most amusing. These wise
boys are not in any position to
throw their idol overboard.
They could not because they
would have nowhere else to
go for worship. But their
chagrin at the fact that the
general speaks for himself is
ill concealed. They had ap-
parently assumed they they
were to go on indefinitely as
his representatives and
spokesmen.
Some of them are saying
that Eisenhower is merely
playing a shrewd political
game to beguile conservative
Republicans up to the nomina-
tion and that he will thereaft-
er join the "me too" school.
This is, of course, a covert
charge of insincerity by the
very people who have been
telling us all along that Eisen-
hower is a profoundly honest
man.
A notable member of this
leftist school makes the in-
credible statement in one of
the leading Eisenhower papers
that there is an inconsistency
between the general's state-
ments in the press confer-
ences and his prepared Abilene
speech.
The time may not be distant
when the body of Eisenhower
support will be radically
changed. And the new sup-
porters will be a distinct im-
provement.
