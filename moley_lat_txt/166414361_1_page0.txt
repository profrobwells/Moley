A NATIONAL
DECISION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The victory was too big to
be claimed by anybody, but it
was big enough to be shared
by everybody who helped.
That is the real significance
of such a nationwide sweep.
It has crossed all sectional
lines, all political spheres of
influence, and all economic and
social divisions. That makes
it a real national decision. It
has placed Eisenhower in a
position to create what will be
a substantially reconstructed
party. Now, after a lapse of a
century, we can have a genuine
two-party system.

The two-headed elephant
with which Gov. Stevenson
had so much fun has—in the
magic of victory become a big,
normal, one-headed creature.
Had the eastern Republican
leaders won their States with
the Midwest lagging, there
would already be suggestions
to reconstruct the party in
the image of the eastern faction.
Had the Midwest decided
the election, there would be
loud demands that the so-
called internationalists get out
of the picture. But both political
persuasions were able
to win, and both can share in
the constructive work that lies
ahead.

Leaders of all shades of opinion
in the party can and
should face the future in a
spirit of goodwill and compromise.
There is common
ground for all, and that common
ground is far from the
area which the Roosevelt-
Truman party staked out for
itself.

The capture of Southern
States by Eisenhower can well
be the beginning of the end
of the sorry rift that has
plagued our party politics
since Reconstruction days.

There is definitely a means
of compromising the civil
rights issue that will provide
for justice and at the same
time respect the sovereignty
of the Southern States. The
new President might well summon
all southern leaders and
place the responsibility before
them to adjust the remaining
issues in that field by
State authority. By a wide
process of party building, a
healthy Republican Party can
grow in most of the States of
the South.

Even more important than
the bridging of these factional
and sectional divisions is the
task of making the Republican
Party really representative of
all economic groups.

For more than 16 years—I
should say roughly since 1936
—the spirit of class has been
cultivated by the administration
in Washington. This was
a course deliberately chosen
by President Roosevelt to assure
himself of vast majorities
in the cities and labor centers.
It will be written in impartial
history that this was one
of the more unfortunate sides
of his statesmanship. President
Truman has more crudely and
energetically promoted this
class feeling.

In this election the voters
have been wiser and less selfish
than they were conceived
to be. Farmers, wage earners
and businessmen of all sorts
have raised their sights. They
have seen in the leadership of
Eisenhower a means of protecting
the great national welfare,
rather than their many
assorted little welfares. The
great middle interests of the
country have at last found
common ground, and because
they represent the real majority
they have prevailed.

Not for many years, perhaps
not since James Monroe or
George Washington, has a
President enjoyed such an opportunity
to speak for a united
country. And we can feel
assured that Gen. Eisenhower
has not only the heart but the
mind to make the most of that
rare chance.
