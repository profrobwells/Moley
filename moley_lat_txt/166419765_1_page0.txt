Now That It's All Over,
Let's Say 'Never Again!"
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the confetti and ticker
tape blow away and the cam-
paign slogans die out, let me
suggest a slogan for the next
four years. It is "Don't let it
happen again," and my "it"
refers to our method of run-
ning a Presidential campaign.
wrong with our constitutional
method of electing a Presi-
dent. But everything is wrong
about the way parties operate.
The ordeal through which
we have just passed was dread-
ful for all concerned. It is a
wonder that the two candi-
dates could survive it. The
public has been alternately
bored and overexcited. A pot
of money has been wasted.
And the press and other
means of communication have
been reduced to a state of
confusion, irrelevance and sen-
sationalism. The people who
labor for those means of com-
munication have ended up
with frayed or broken nerves
and utter physical exhaustion.
Our Presidential campaigns
are far too long. Everything
essential could be
plished if the conventions were
held in the latter half of Au-
gust. Then active campaign-
ing could begin in late Sep-
tember. Shortening the cam-
paign would make it essential
for managers to plan their
candidate's trips efficiently.
Look back at the crazy criss-
crossing of the country by the
two candidates. There was no
sense in it. Planning would
have reduced the miles trav-
eled by half.
★
But there was no real plan-
ning. Things were improvised
from week to week. The States
that screamed loudest had to
be visited twice or three
times. It is estimated that
each candidate traveled a min-
imum of 35,000 miles. Eisen-
hower visited 44 States; Ste-
venson, 32. Each made about
200 speeches. This was ex-
cessive and unnecessary.
This is a big country, but
it is not big enough to make
such traveling necessary.
A trip can be made by train,
automobile or airplane from
New York through the North-
west and back through the
Southwest and the Border
States with a minimum mile-
age of 9000 miles. In my own
travels as a commentator I
do it every year. Another trip
can cover the major cities in
the South and as far west as
Texas in 5000 miles. Then
some short trips, aggregating
4000 more miles. This would
cover the country fairly well.
The two candidates'
speeches were repetitious un-
to the far reaches of platitudi-
nous boredom. The real meat
of what each said could be
printed on the newspaper page
upon which this article ap-
pears.
In England a Parliamentary
campaign occupies three
weeks. The major parties di-
vide among themselves only
about a dozen hours on the
BBC. There is stumping
among the constituencies, but
that is inexpensive and meas-
urably stimulating.
★
If the campaigns here were
run on such a schedule as I
indicate above, everything
essential could be brought to
the attention of voters. The
candidates could be seen by
almost everybody who might
want to see them.
But behind such a stream-
lined plan should be better
party work between elections.
There should be no break in
party management as is now
the case. Each party should
employ a permanent, paid,
full-time manager or chair-
man. He should be impartial
among candidates in his own
party. His business would be
to "elect, not select." He should
have ready for the campaign
research material and speech
editors for the use of the can-
didate.
In this campaign there was
absurd and complete duplica-
tion of effort. The Republican
National Committee had an
excellent research organiza-
tion built up under Chairman
Gabrielson. But the Eisen-
hower amateurs set up, slam-
bang, another in Denver. The
latter would have been un-
necessary if proper connec-
tions had been made. Steven-
son had no idea how truly he
spoke when he said there
were two Republican Parties.
So here we are, a model of
mechanical efficiency in pri-
vate industry, but a horrible
mess in our means of choos-
ing a President. And we never
had it so bad as this time.
