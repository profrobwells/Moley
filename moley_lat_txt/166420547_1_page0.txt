SCHOOL SEGREGATION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While segregation laws in
several States were attacked
in the Supreme Court last
week, the most notable and
perhaps the key case was that
involving the school districts
of Clarendon County, S.C.
John W. Davis and other emi-
nent lawyers participated in
the argument, and, judging by
the questions of the justices,
this case will be the focal
point in their deliberations.
It has taken a long time to
bring this Clarendon case to
the stage of argument.
★
When Gov. James F. Byrnes
was inaugurated nearly two
years ago, this case was pending.
The plaintiffs were a
number of Negroes in Claren-
don County; the defendants, a
number of district school trus-
tees and officials. The case
was promoted by the Nation-
al Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People
and has been argued by counsel
employed by that organi-
zation.
The plaintiffs brought suit
for declaratory judgment and
injunctive relief. They assert-
ed that the educational facili-
ties provided for Negro chil-
dren in that district were inferior
and that this amounted
to a denial of equal protection
of the laws guaranteed by the
14th Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States.
They alleged further that the
segregation of white from Ne-
gro children in all public
schools was in violation of
the same provision in the U.S.
Constitution.
Thus, two related but distinct
issues were raised—the
first, that the separate Negro
schools were inferior; the sec-
ond, that no segregation is con-
stitutional.
The defendants admitted
that their Negro schools were
inferior, but maintained that
under a new program launched
by Gov. Byrnes and the Legis-
lature they were being brought
to a status equal to that of
the schools for white children.
In reply to the second point,
the defendants asserted that
the 14th Amendment did not
intend to prohibit State legisla-
tion providing for segregation.
The case finally got before
a three-judge Federal court
in the eastern district of South
Carolina. Presiding was the
distinguished John J. Parker,
chief judge of the Fourth Cir-
cuit Court. Judge Parker
handed down his decision in
May, 1951.

His decision declared that
the constitutional and statu-
tory segregation was not in
violation of the 14th Amend-
ment. However, it found that
the Negro schools were inferior
and it gave the State
and the school authorities six
months to develop improve-
ments.
Meanwhile, the State of
South Carolina had provided a
$75,000,000 bond issue to im-
prove schools and was begin-
ning to build, with a special
accent on Negro schools.
After the allotted six
months, the three-man court
unanimously upheld the State
and district authorities. The
case now before the Supreme
Court is an appeal from this
decision.
The State building program
has been progressing very
well, despite shortages of steel.
Nearly $30,000,000 has already
been spent, of which 77% has
gone into Negro schools.

In a visit to South Carolina
last week, I was told that these
new Negro schools are more
modern and physically better
than the white schools. Still,
there has been no unrest
among the white parents about
these improvements. The new
building will go on until the
goal of equality is reached.
Meanwhile, the State of
South Carolina is officially de-
termined to resort to other
means of segregation if the
decision of the Supreme Court
in this case declares against
segregation in the public
schools. At the recent elec-
tion an amendment to the
State constitution was adopted,
providing for the aban-
donment of the public school
system if segregation is prohibited.
Under a new system
the State would grant school
funds to private schools for
Negroes and for whites.
The questions of the justices
in last week's argument seem
to indicate that such contingency
is remote. They would
seem to indicate a majority on
the side of segregation with
equal facilities.
