Leaks From 'Advisers'
Are Hurting Eisenhower
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Shakespeare's "Henry IV,"
Part 2, opens with a speech
by "Rumor, painted full of
tongues," in which appear
these lines:
"Rumor is a pipe
"Blown by surmises, jealous.
ies, conjectures,
"And of so easy and so plain a
stop
"The still-discordant wavering
multitude
"Can play upon it."
This allegorical figure is
there because it "runs before
King Harry's victory."
It is now running before
Gen. Eisenhower's victory.
It is quoted under various
names. A favorite one used in
news reports is "some of Ei-
senhower's close advisers."
Others are merely designated
as "sources," or "informants."
And, thus disguised, these
gremlins are up to no end of
mischief.

There was plenty of chatter
from these sources during the
campaign. Reports emanated
from Ike's "advisers" in Den-
ver, on the campaign train
and at the New York Commo-
dore Hotel that the Republi-
can candidate "thought" or
was "considering" this or that.
Generally, the purpose of
these leaks was to commit the
General to policies or courses
of action that fitted the person-
al views or ambitions of these
"advisers."
They were bitterly opposed
to Taft and other midwestern
Republicans. And so they let
it be rumored that Eisenhow-
er was merely playing with
those Republican leaders for
the moment. Later "it was be-
lieved" the "Old Guard" would
be scuttled. This, of course,
was attributing no great vir-
tue to Eisenhower.
But these busy boys were
not deeply worried about El-
senhower's interests except in
so far as his success might
promote their concerns.
Hence, since the Durkin ap-
pointment, these "advisers"
have emitted a tremendous
chatter. These people have
disseminated the theory that
Eisenhower deliberately by-
passed Taft because he
wanted to show that he, not
Taft, was "boss." Then, ac-
cording to one published ac-
count;
"This rough treatment
might be followed by sooth-
ing lotion. Ike's advisers hint
Taftmen may be tossed a few
jobs later-maybe even the
party chairmanship-If Taft is
a good boy."

The people who are doing
this sort of thing are not hard
to identify. Experienced news-
papermen can name several.
They are not the Cabinet des-
ignees, nor are "they" Gov.
Adams. Some of them are
draftees from the staffs of cer-
tain magazines who were, in
the rush and confusion of the
campaign, seized as writers
and researchers. A little prom-
inence has turned their heads.
They apparently are unable to
behave like people in respon-
sible places.
No one can blame hard-
pressed newspapermen for
drawing upon this source of
news. People around a candi-
date or a President-elect find
a daily stint of news hard to
get. The blame rests with the
unnamed "advisers" or
"sources."
Gen. Eisenhower should
stop this leakage. It can well
spell basic trouble for him
within his administration and
with Congress,
