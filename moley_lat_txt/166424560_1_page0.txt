COLUMBIA, S.C.—It would
be wise for Northerners to
speak of the Southern States
rather than of the South. For
what is commonly called the
South is composed of an un-
commonly diverse lot of
States. Hence, my comments
which follow refer in the main
to the State in which this is
written and to a degree to
Florida, of which I have a
good deal of firsthand infor-
mation.
The great upheaval here, in
the recent election was not so
much manifested in the big
vote for Eisenhower. To a
degree that was attributable
to the popularity of the Gen-
eral and the bitter hatred of
Trumanism. The more signifi-
cant thing is the fact that a
major reason for a one-party
system has been removed.
Southern States decided
after the Civil War and the
anarchy that followed that
there was only one way to
maintain white control, and
that was to concentrate on the
Democratic Party and to de-
cide things in primaries
rather than elections. This de-
cision was based on the quite
reasonable supposition that if
there were two parties fairly
equal in strength the Negro
vote would be decisive. The
presumption was that the
Negroes, so far as they were
possessed of the right to vote,
would be Republican.

But in the recent election in
South Carolina and, so far as
I have been able to deter-
mine, in Florida the Negroes
cast their votes almost solidly
for Stevenson. They voted as
a bloc. Gov. Byrnes stated in
a speech that in a ward in
Columbia where all the voters
except about 100 were Ne-
groes there were 1250 votes for
Stevenson and 135 for Eisen-
hower.
In the city of Darlington
there are two precincts where
almost all the Negroes are
concentrated. In one of these,
Stevenson received 502 votes
and Eisenhower four. In the
other Stevenson received 229
votes and Eisenhower not one.
A Negro newspaper in
Columbia estimates that be-
tween 60,000 and 80,000 votes
in the State were cast by Ne-
groes and that "there is no
doubt that South Carolina's
Negro voters were the only
reason that the State man-
aged to return to the Demo-
cratic column."
★
Gov. Byrnes estimated that
a minimum of 59,000 Negroes
voted for Stevenson and 1000
for Eisenhower. When it is
considered that Stevenson car-
ried the State by only 8000,
the inference of the Negro
paper, quoted above, is ines-
capable. This bloc voting, ac-
cording to the Governor, was
due in part at least to the ef-
forts of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of
Colored People.
It would seem that if this
bloc voting continues the
Democratic Party must pay
the penalty of being placed in
the same position that the Re-
publican Party occupied for
75 years. For bloc begets
bloc, and those who oppose a
solid group which votes on
racial lines will tend to con-
solidate in opposition.
★
There are many other fac-
tors in the situation in South
Carolina which make any esti-
mate of the future difficult.
The election laws must be
overhauled, and Gov. Byrnes
is prepared to propose a num-
ber of changes to the Legisla-
ture. The Republican Party
in South Carolina is not re-
spected and is small in num-
ber.
If the national Republican
Party attempts to reward
that organization, it will
alienate many who voted for
Eisenhower. There is also the
great danger of the "South
Carolinians for Eisenhower"
losing interest now that the
election is over.
But despite these factors it
is likely that under the lead-
ership of young and ambi-
tious men and women there
will, in the course of a few
years, be developed a strong
new Republican Party in this
State.
