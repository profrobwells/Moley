STEVENSON'S DESIGN FOR
GOVERNMENT BY UNIONS.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The speech of Gov. Steven-
son to the AFL is another
notable revelation not only of
his strategy as a campaigner
but of his essentially radical
convictions. To get at the
meat of his speeches you must
first push through a heavy
coating of clever and sweet-
sounding phrases, wisecracks
and double meanings. Then,
carefully embedded in the con-
text, you find propositions that
reveal his complete agreement
with the boys on the left. Let
me illustrate.
First, he emits this colorful
smoke screen: "To face the
facts on labor relations is to
be accused of 'captivity' and
of 'turning left.' These are
words without roots, weeds
which grow in darkness and
wither in the sun. But the
sun is sometimes slow to rise,
especially in campaign years."
After this flowery passage,
he says that "American labor
is today much more than an
instrument for collective bar-
gaining. It has become a vital
agency of a working democ-
racy."
A correct interpretation of
this statement is that the la-
bor unions have become an
agency of the government.
Finally, he comes to specifi-
cations. The Department of
Labor is to be built up. First,
it is to become the "keeper of
the people's budget." From
what I know of the desires of
the American people, they
would like to keep their own
budget.
Next, the department should
"help train the men who make
democracy work in the labor
unions and around the bar-
gaining tables." Now, without
permitting ourselves to sway
to and fro to the cadence of
the rest of Stevenson's speech,
let us consider what this
means.
It means that the Federal
government will set up a
school or some other means to
train and educate the agents
of unions to perform their
work. Their job is to organ-
ize unions and to prevail in
collective bargaining. Thus,
the government is to teach
them how to get the best pos-
sible deal from management.
In short, government is to
align itself with labor and
against management.

Of course, this process of
throwing the weight of gov-
ernment on the labor side of
the scale has been going on for
a long time. But hitherto it
has been largely through the
covert acts of mediators or the
decisions of the National La-
bor Relations Board. Now,
however, Stevenson proposes
to make it open and official.
There was a time when
Idealists conceived of govern-
ment as something that be-
longed to us all. When there
were disputes among us gov-
ernment was the high court
-serene and impartial. That,
I submit, was the concept
written into our Constitution.
Candidate Stevenson pro-
poses to change all that. He
proposes that we be governed
by a partnership between the
politicians temporarily in of-
fice and the politicians who
run the labor unions. Thus
we should have not only a
labor political party but a la-
bor government.
I wonder how the southern
Democrats will greet this pro-
posal.
