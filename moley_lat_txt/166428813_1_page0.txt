With George Gallup, life is
just one bad prediction aft-
er another, followed by one
alibi after another. It grows
monotonous. And so it is with
Messrs. Roper and Crossley.
Perhaps now they may lay
aside the incense, the box of
sand and the crystal ball and
stick to plain reporting.
Four years ago, Prof. Lind-
say Rogers wrote a book, "The
Pollsters," thoroughly debunk-
ing these brethren. But their
capacity to reach the public
through a tolerant press was
great, while the Rogers sphere
of influence was small. Hence,
this useful book is forgotten.
But a new, revised edition
might do well now after this
election. There is rich new ma-
terial and, while I have no
statistics on the point, my in-
tuition tells me that many
more people now are aware of
the pollsters' fallacies.
This year the nonsense
started some months ago when
Dr. Gallup predicted that 55,-
000,000 people would vote.
Then, with his customary as-
sumption of infallibility, he di-
vided those people into groups.
There were to be 22,000,000
Democrats, 18,000,000 Republi-
cans, and 15,000,000 "inde-
pendents." I am still unable
to understand how he got
those figures. Maybe, by some
statistical hocus-pocus, an ap-
proximation of the voting
strength of the Republican
Party and the Democratic
Party could be arrived at.
Perhaps by asking people how
they voted or registered over
a period of years.
But even so the criteria by
which a Democrat or a Repub-
lican is determined must be
vague and indefinite.
Take my own case. I was
registered as a Democrat all
my life until 1946. But during
10 of those years I voted reg-
ularly for Republican candi-
dates for President, for Con-
gress, and for State offices.
Perhaps Dr. Gallup would call
me a Republican. That would
be "guilt by association." He
might call me a Democrat by
registration. But I believe he
would call me an "independ-
ent." But I would not like that
at all. For, as in the case of the
purple cow, I never saw an
independent, I never hope to
see one, and anyhow I would
rather see than be one.
A citizen may not always
vote with the same party, but
he is nevertheless following
an ideological line when he
does vote. Or he may exercise
his right as an American to
tell one of Dr. Gallup's solici-
tors that it is none of Dr. Gal-
lup's business how he is go-
ing to vote. In short, a voter
may be independent of Dr.
Gallup without being inde-
pendent of party preference.
Not only was Dr. Gallup's
prediction 5,000,000 short of
the actual vote, but there was
no scientific or common-sense
basis for the 15,000,000 "inde-
pendent" guess.
Finally, after his figures of
declared voters showed a Re-
publican landslide, he was
stricken with fear. To play
safe, he did an extraordinary
thing.
Perhaps, as a fellow com-
mentator, David Lawrence,
says, it would be best for the
national pollsters to limit
themselves to commercial
work and leave politics alone.
Or, if they do touch politics,
they might present facts and
omit predictions.
This year, however, the lo-
cal polls conducted by many
newspapers were exceeding-
ly helpful. Some were very ac-
curate reflections of what hap-
pened. Why that was so and
how such polls may have
great usefulness I shall write
about in another column.
