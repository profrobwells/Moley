Misreporting of America
by British Newspapermen
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is reported from Britain
that some newspaper editors
and proprietors over there
are beginning to wonder
whether their correspondents
in the United States really
know what they have been
writing about. They may well
wonder, for they have pub-
lished a running commentary
on our politics that is a prize
example of misleading, dis-
torted, careless, prejudiced,
and erroneous reporting.
I have long been disturbed
by this matter and since the
election I have gathered a
mountain of evidence which
proves every one of the five
adjectives in the foregoing
sentence. Space permits here
only one specimen reporter,
neither better nor worse than
several who write for im-
portant British papers.

Alistair Cooke is a person
of some consequence. He lists
himself as chief correspondent
in the United States for the
Manchester Guardian and
commentator on American af-
fairs for the British Broadcast-
ing Corp. He has recently been
selected as master of ceremon-
ies for the Ford Foundation
television program. His com-
mentaries are also broadcast
by radio in the United States.
Mr. Cooke is one of a num-
ber of British correspondents
over here who, with appar-
ently little effort to survey the
country as a whole, are con-
tent to exchange views with
a group of American news-
papermen very limited in
number and in outlook. In
short, he has taken his hear-
ings from the provincialism of
New York and Washington.

One firm test of this group
is that Sen. Taft and those
who support him are hope-
lessly obtuse, reactionary and
corrupt. For example, this ap-
peared in the Manchester
Guardian, in the American
reports, on June 19 of this
year:
"Taft's men, defying one of
the few ethical customs dis-
cernible in the raw struggle
of a convention, have managed
to get two Taftites as keynote
speaker and temporary chair-
man."
Another tenet was the blind
acceptance of Democratic
propaganda asserting that the
Republican Party was hope-
lessly shattered. On July 10
this appeared in the same
paper:
"It is a question whether
any sizable Republican vote
can be corralled from the
wounded remnants of two
snarling camps inside the
party."

Next, the group decided that
Stevenson should and would
win. On Sept. 4 Mr. Cooke
predicted:
"Eisenhower is going to
have a hard time topping 200
votes. My own guess just now,
for whatever its idle worth,
would be that Stevenson will
wind up with something like
300 votes to Eisenhower's
231."
Now, having ventured his
wishful prediction, he sought
to rationalize it. On Oct. 9 he
asserted:
"The Republicans are un-
doubtedly united in an out-
size bed where there is room
for everybody except the few
liberals who got the General
his nomination. The General
has made up to every mem-
ber of the Old Guard who has
fought down the years every-
thing he was supposed to
stand for,"

Then, during October, he
and many others were drink-
ing in deep draughts of the
Democratic propaganda that
Stevenson was "gaining," that
Eisenhower had fallen heavily
between sulking Deweyites
and sullen machine Taftites.
But on the eve of the elec-
tion, on Oct. 31, something
seemed to move Mr. Cooke,
in a BBC broadcast, to hedge.
While still implying that the
electorate would vote accord-
ing to the "money in their
pockets," he confessed that he
did not know how the election
would come out. His commen-
tary was frothy, mostly ir-
relevant, and wholly devoid
of any evidence that he had
really tried to learn anything
beyond the limited knowledge
of his journalistic cronies in
New York and in Washington.
In another column I shall
offer some quotes from Mr.
Cooke's broadcasts after the
election.
