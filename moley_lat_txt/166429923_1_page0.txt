The 'Hoover Depression'
-a Long-Lived Canard
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Earlier in the campaign,
Gov. Stevenson said that he
didn't intend "to run against
Hoover." This must have been
prompted by his belief as an
intelligent person that to go
back 20 years for issues was
rather absurd.
But now, apparently re-
sponding to the outcries of
Democrats who say his ear-
lier speeches were not getting
votes, he has decided to fol-
low the old line. He is asking
people to vote for him because
people were poor in 1932 and
because President Roosevelt
made them rich. And, of
course, President Truman is
screaming about the Hoover
depression.
The fact is that Stevenson
has gone back beyond Hoover
to Coolidge and Harding and,
to the amazement of all be-
lievers in rational argument,
even to Gen. Grant. Beyond
that he cannot go without
traducing Lincoln, the first
Republican President.
But this perennial about the
responsibility for the depres-
sion deserves attention. For
it is almost wholly a fabrica-
tion of politicians. I know of
no reputable economist who
would assert that the depres-
sion was the fault of the Hoo-
ver administration. Such great
economic dislocations come
from many causes, here in
America and abroad. That one
certainly came from abroad,
although it acquired some
force here because of the neg-
lect of agriculture and be-
cause of unfortunate Federal
Reserve policies.

The most complete, docu-
mented answer to the charge
that the Hoover administra-
tion caused the depression is
by Herbert Hoover himself in
the third volume of his
memoirs, which is currently a
best seller.
In a review of this book,
Dr. Louis M. Hacker of Co-
lumbia University, whose
writings rank him as a def-
inite New Dealer, of the early
and more rational years of
that movement, says:
"Mr. Hoover once and for
all disposes of two still gen-
erally entertained canards of
which he is the victim: that
the depression was his re-
sponsibility, and that he sat
helpless and dazed in the
White House as its fury
spread . . . certainly, how-
ever, the universal business col-
lapse of 1929 and after cannot
be placed at Mr. Hoover's door.
And as for being idle—once
the storm broke . . . Mr. Hoo-
ver was energy and resource
incarnate."
As a witness to the events
of those days, in which I oc-
cupied more or less of a front
seat, I can confirm Hacker's
judgment.

I can also add, from my
knowledge as a participant in
the relations between Hoover
and Roosevelt between the
election in 1932 and the inau-
guration in 1933, the confirma-
tion of another significant an-
swer by Hoover to this end-
less partisan smear now
harped upon by Messrs. Tru-
man and Stevenson. Hoover
eagerly sought the co-opera-
tion of Roosevelt and the Con-
gress to ward off the last and
almost fatal phase—the bank
crisis.
It is my considered judg-
ment that if Roosevelt had
asked his party colleagues in
Congress to co-operate with
Hoover in essential actions to
strengthen the banks as ear-
ly as January, the crash of
early March would never have
taken place. And Alben Bar-
kley, who over the years has
been one of the loudest shout-
ers of the smear, sat motion-
less in the Senate while all
this went on.
I have told Hoover that I
had no knowledge of Roose-
velt's motives in refusing to
co-operate. But if he had de-
liberately planned to bring
the country to the brink of
ruin when he took over, Presi-
dent-elect Roosevelt would
have done exactly what he did.
"The Memoirs of Herbert
Hoover," Volume 3, is excel-
lent reading for those who
want an answer to the Tru-
man-Stevenson charges.
