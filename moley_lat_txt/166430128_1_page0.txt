DARKER DAYS IN KOREA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
MILWAUKEE—As the
promise of bitter winter comes
with the first snow to our fight-
ing men in Korea, the false,
treacherous front falls away
from the Communist truce
team at Panmunjom. Ameri-
can blood is flowing freely,
with no hope for peace in
sight.
The Communists are now
heavily reinforced and are
moving forward. Fifteen
months ago, when the peace
talks began, their situation
was desperate.
I have spent the last few
days here and in Chicago and
I find the impact of this re-
newed shedding of American
blood to be very heavy indeed.
The Korean impasse has al-
ways been more real here in
the Midwest and in the Far
West than in Washington and
in the Northeast.
Here in Wisconsin the evi-
dence of people's concern was
revealed in the tremendous
primary victory for Sen. Mc-
Carthy last month. Again and
again I have been told by Mil-
waukee people that they voted
for McCarthy not so much be-
cause they have personal af-
fection for him, but because
he has become a symbol.
Here, however, people know
that McCarthy's campaign
against Communists in govern-
ment is only part of the story.
They know and they say that
McCarthy is one of the very
few who have made a truly
effective presentation of the
diplomatic failures that lie be-
hind the bloody fiasco in
Korea.
It was not a two-year tale,
but a 10-year story. McCar-
thy's indictment of Gen. Mar-
shall's responsibility for the
tragedy in Asia was not wild
or irresponsible. He did not
call Marshall a traitor. He de-
scribed him as a failure. And
the people here believe that
McCarthy made his case and
deserves to be put on guard
for six more years in the
Senate.
And so it made a hollow
sound for Candidate Steven-
son to come to Milwaukee
with his quips and inverted
sentences and denounce
McCarthy. People want some-
one to talk about Korea in
realistic terms. They are sick
of hearing that nothing can be
done, and, I might add, it
makes no sense and no votes
for Stevenson or Truman to
scream at Eisenhower every
time he proposes something
practical about winning the
Korean war.
These people are serious.
They believe that Stevenson
is not serious.
And now, as the fighting in
Korea is intensified and the
bad news faces the people here
in their morning headlines,
this campaign rises to be
something much more than a
mere contest between two
parties or two politicians. It
becomes a way of choosing the
best means for national sur-
vival.
Eisenhower begins to loom
up not as a Republican but
as a national leader—the best
of two people to act in the
grave decisions that lie ahead.
It is quite possible that
Eisenhower may be looked
upon as was Churchill in an
hour of ordeal in Britain.
Character, not political prog-
ress, becomes the issue in this
new turn of the campaign.
People are not listening to
speeches; they are studying
the two men who are making
the speeches.
