President Truman's decision
to blow the whistle loudly at
Hungry Horse Dam was
shrewdly calculated to help
his candidate in the battle for
the vitally important reclama-
tion States. But the value of
projects such as he exploited
in the dedication of that dam
to the nation as a whole
should be brought sharply in-
to question.
Hungry Horse Dam is lo-
cated on the south fork of the
Flathead River, in the midst
of the vast forests that cover
the western slopes of the high
Rockies in Northwestern Mon-
tana. It is just west of Glacier
Park. It is 564 feet high. It is
backing up a volume of water
which will make a 3,500,000-
acre reservoir. Generators are
now being put in which will
produce 285,000 kilowatts. The
electricity generated will go
into the Bonneville pool and
be sold throughout the North-
west.
As has always been the case
in recent years, the cost of
this project is enormously
greater than the original esti-
mate. Somewhere along the
line an estimate of $44,000,000
was made. But the cost now
seems to be $109,230,000. And
it will be higher when all the
incidentals are completed.
As usual, the Bureau of Rec-
lamation claims that this proj-
ect will pay for itself. But such
claims must be discounted be-
cause they always throw in
the word "reimbursable." The
point is that the people who
want to justify these high
dams are the people who keep
the books. The Secretary of
the Interior decides what part
of the cost will be "reimburs-
able." In this case he has as-
signed $367,000 to navigation
and $19,302,000 to flood con-
trol. These are "nonreimburs-
able"â€”what we taxpayers
must all chip in. But they are
wholly arbitrary figures. Their
value is doubtful.
In the case of Hungry Horse
a very great loss is sustained
which is not figured in the
cost. This is the value of the
timber which will be sub-
merged and destroyed. Accord-
ing to a frank criticism by a
representative of the Forest
Service of the Department of
Agriculture, 20,000 acres of
the most productive timber-
land in the Flathead National
Forest will be covered by wa-
ter.
The building of such a dam
and its vast reservoir very
seriously cripples the econom-
ic life of the region, which de-
pends largely on timber. The
city of Kalispell already feels
the pinch, since it becomes ex-
ceedingly difficult to market
the timber upstream.
Since the early days of
Roosevelt and Ickes it has
been an obsession in the
White House and Interior De-
partment to build these high
dams and exploit the develop-
ment of electric power at the
expense of everything else, in-
cluding the original purpose
of reclamation, which was the
enlargement of the supply of
productive land.
There was fairly good sense
in building the Bonneville and
Grand Coulee projects because
they did not impair other in-
dustries and they supply
much-needed power. But as
these projects are multiplied
far upstream and on the tribu-
taries, the costs rise and the
value falls.
Meanwhile, the efficiency of
steam power plants increases,
and new and immense sources
of fuel and power are now in
sight.
Hungry Horse is built and
we must make the best of it.
It is literally and figuratively
water over the dam. But the
American public, groaning
under a huge tax burden,
should know more and say
more about the government's
fixed idea of more and high-
er power dams.
