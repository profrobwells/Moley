Gov. Stevenson is often more
revealing in his interpolated
remarks than in his set speech-
es. For those ad libs, we know,
are really his own, although
the speeches may be by Schles-
inger or someone else.
In the prepared speech for
Detroit which went over the
Associated Press there is no
reference to Alger Hiss in the
Stevenson reference to Com-
munism. But in the speech as
transcribed, there is.
★
As it was reported by the
New York Times, the Steven-
son speech had this passage
which referred to the depres-
sion days of 1932:
"It's little wonder that
across the land men and wom-
en-and especially the young
-began to drift toward the
terrible conclusion that free
government had reached the
end of its rope.
"Reaching out for a solu-
tion-any solution-the Com-
munist agents found ready
converts among the unem-
ployed, the farmers, the work-
ers. It was then that some
persons like Alger Hiss and
Elizabeth Bentley, witnessing
the devastation of capitalism
and the menacing rise of Hit-
ler, became entangled in the
Communist conspiracy.

"In the election of 1932 al-
most 1,000,000 Americans voted
against the capitalist system-
1,000,000. If the paralysis had
continued in Washington, the
1,000,000 votes cast against
capitalism in 1928 (sic) might
have swelled to 10,000,000 by
1936."
While I should like to ques-
tion Gov. Stevenson's right to
pass as an authority on social
and economic conditions in
1932, I cannot deny that he
was in an excellent position
later to become an authority
on Alger Hiss. But I do deny
the entire soft theory of Com-
munism on which that passage
is based.
For it is based upon the as-
sumption that the youth in
those days found in Commu-
nism a rational outlet for their
feelings. This is hardly tenable
except in a few isolated cases.
Stevenson's activities in 1932
seem to have been in his law
firm in Chicago. His biogra-
pher, Noel Busch, says that
Stevenson was busy during
those years with "salvage jobs
on farm mortgages and urban
bond issues." Busch suggests
further, that Stevenson's
knowledge of the plight of the
unemployed was gained by
gazing through his window on
La Salle St.

In 1931 and part of 1932 I
was engaged in active teaching
in Columbia University. My
contact was with hundreds of
students and dozens of pro-
fessors, I knew only one who
had reached the conclusion
"that free government had
reached the end of its rope."
I also traveled with Roose-
velt on all his campaign trips
after he was nominated. I saw
the crowds that came out to
hear him and the mail that
came to him. There was de-
pression, but there was noth-
ing of the wild disorder de-
scribed by Stevenson in his
Detroit speech.
If Hiss decided that he
would have a more brilliant
future under Communism, it
certainly was not because of
any hardship visited upon him.
He was very well kept by the
capitalist system. He was no
innocent victim of his environ-
ment. He was an evil, treach-
erous person, completely re-
sponsible for his behavior.
★
But the fact that Stevenson
is willing to accept this soft,
environmental interpretation
of evil is a significant matter.
A person who holds such a
view would be a poor Presi-
dential risk.
