Had Adlal Stevenson
chosen to add to the wealth
of quips in his speech at the
Jefferson-Jackson dinner in
New York, he might have
started with the proverbial
phrase of the green after-din-
ner speaker: "Unaccustomed
as I am."
For truly, as the former
candidate noted later, the
leaders of the Democratic
Party can hardly realize that
they are out of office. Criti-
cism of the government
comes not easily to them.
They are approaching it with
all the shaking uncertainty of
a boy proposing to his first
love. Words are scarcely ade-
quate, even to a master of
language like Stevenson.

The formula he is using is
a familiar trick of his — a
product of his urbane nature.
It is the I-assume-you-have-
not-been-beating-your-wife-
this-morning. It is the pious
hope that screens the inner
hope that the worst is true.
For example: "I hope I
have misread the signs of the
revival of the discredited
'dollar diplomacy.'" He does
not offer an indication of
what the signs are. He in-
timates that there are signs.
His method is that of an ex-
perienced jury trial lawyer.
It follows the theory that to
implant a good suspicion is
vastly more effective than a
poor piece of evidence. This
method suggests the
minister's prayer over the
dead body of a sinful parish-
ioner: "We all hope he is
where we know he isn't."

Likewise, the Stevenson ref-
erence to businessmen in gov-
ernment: "This most recent
experiment in the manage-
ment of our public affairs
demands our support and our
sympathy." It is clear, how-
ever, that the "experiment"
will get more sympathy than
support, because Stevenson
says also that "government by
a single group, no matter how
high-minded and patriotic it
may be, exposes government
to genuine dangers." Thus,
there is once more raised the
old battle cry against busi-
nessmen. Stevenson's use of
this weapon is more astute
than F. D. R.'s heavy-handed
attacks or Truman's rasping
references to "the interests,"
but it has the same meaning.
There are, in fact, only a
few more businessmen among
the Eisenhower appointees
than among those who were
supplanted. And after all, the
measure of worth will be the
character of service rendered.

But a few hints of criticism
mingled with a new expres-
sion of old stand-bys of Demo-
cratic oratory are not a real
opposition policy. It does not
draw a clear line of argument
to say: "The Democratic and
Republican Parties today are
separated by the same old
principles which divided Jef-
ferson and Hamilton." This
division is true, but not in
the sense which Stevenson in-
tended to imply. For the
Republicans are now general-
ly opposed to Hamiltonian
views of Federal power, and
the northern Democrats, in-
cluding Stevenson, are dedi-
cated to more and more
Federal authority. Only the
Democrats of the South have
remained true to Jefferson's
concept of the rights of
States.
This irreconcilable conflict
in his own party Stevenson
tactfully avoided. But it is
there and it will take a leader
of vastly more originality
than the 1952 candidate to re-
solve it.
