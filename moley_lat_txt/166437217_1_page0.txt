PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE
ELECTRIC POWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may be that since elec-
tion time Socialistic bureau-
crats have seen the light, but
it is more likely that they
have felt the heat. The fore-
going quip is borrowed from
Henry Ashurst, once Senator
from Arizona. The adaptation
is prompted by a proposal re-
cently made in Seattle by
Dr. Paul J. Raver, chief of
the great Bonneville power
administration.
Dr. Raver, it should be ex-
plained, has long been an ar-
dent though somewhat diplo-
matic advocate of public ver-
sus private power. His job
would have implied that, al-
though nominally private and
public electric power agen-
cies are all supposed to find
common ground in the Bon-
neville setup. But now Dr.
Raver has proposed some-
thing that indicates that the
advocates of the nationaliza-
tion of power production may
be willing to grant some, at
least, of the contentions of
private enterprise.
He is quoted as saying:
"I suggest that we take
power completely out of the
hands of the Federal gov-
ernment and place it in the
hands of a regional board,
either elected or appointed by
the Governors of the States
concerned."
This board, Raver suggests,
should have the job of financ-
ing and building power dams.
The money for the construc-
tion would be raised by bonds
sold in the open market.
This proposal was so prom-
ising that Douglas McKay,
Secretary-designate of the In-
terior, was moved to comment
that this idea was "on the
right track" and that "I am
in favor of any good plan to
get the government out of
the power business."
McKay, while acknowl-
edging the fact that a large
part of the power business
is being carried on in the
Northwest by local public
power agencies, nevertheless
is firmly against the Socialis-
tic plans and projects pro-
moted by the Interior De-
partment for nearly 20 years.
The Raver statement may
mean a break in the long
struggle for survival by the
private power companies of
the Northwest.
The Raver idea is far from
new. Some such solution has
been in the air for a long
time. As long ago as 1926,
Herbert Hoover, then Secre-
tary of Commerce, proposed
in a notable speech in Seat-
tle the development of the
Columbia River basin by co-
operative action on a region-
al basis.
Again and again it has
been pointed out that if, as
the advocates of these pow-
er dams say, such projects
are truly self-liquidating,
the place for the test is the
open bond market, not in
drives for Congressional ap-
propriations. That point was
made very forcibly by Gov.
Driscoll of New Jersey at
the Governors' conference
in 1950.
But the zeal of the vast
bureaucracy of the Interior
Department, backed for 20
years by Presidents! Roose-
velt and Truman, has admit-
ted no compromise.
Perhaps we are approach-
ing the point where this is-
sue can be lifted from the
darkness of prejudice and ex-
posed to the light of prac-
tical common sense.
