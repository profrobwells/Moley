President Truman was
shrewd enough in his barn-
storming in the Northwest to
place great reliance upon the
fact that most of the Ameri-
can people would not know
what he was talking about.
Hence, ne could abandon all
respect for the truth and re-
veal himself nakedly as the
complete demagogue that he
is. I have pointed out in two
previous columns the falsity
of his statements at the Hun-
gry Horse Dam and how com-
pletely wrong he was about
the Republican record on rec-
lamation.
That is why Gen. Eisenhow-
er's Seattle speech deserves
careful examination. I consider
it to be the best speech he has
made since his nomination.
Some of us have lived in fear
of what he might do when he
reached this subject. For while
few people east of the Missis-
sippi realize it, the existence
of the people in a dozen States
depends upon a sound develop-
ment of the water and land re-
sources of those States.
Not only that, but when I
was able, early in August, to
see and appraise Eisenhower's
brain trust, there seemed to be
no one in sight who could pre-
pare for the General the ma-
terial necessary for a speech
on this touchy subject. Some
of us urged that he invite Guy
Gordon, the quiet but im-
mensely able senior Senator
from Oregon. His help was ap-
parently received. The result
is a simple formula which not
only assures progress but pro-
tects the legitimate interests
of the States and of private
property.
The development of a great
river valley such as that of the
Columbia requires co-operative
planning by the many States
involved, by the Federal gov-
ernment, and by the private
companies which have vital
contributions to make.
This kind of co-operation
was urged by Herbert Hoover
in a notable speech in Seattle
in 1926. On the basis of the
principles laid down in that
speech of Hoover, the Hoover
Dam was planned and de-
veloped. Also, the original
concepts of Bonneville and
Grand Coulee were created
during the Hoover administra-
tion. After the building of
these dams and under the
driving ambition of President
Roosevelt and Secretary Ickes,
the original concept of co-op-
eration was abandoned. The
insatiable lust for power of
the Federal government re-
vealed itself more and more.
Out of this came the idea of
a Columbia Valley Authority
similar to the TVA. Obvious-
ly this kind of development
was inappropriate for the
Northwest, and the States vio-
lently opposed it. The Interi-
or Department just as vigor-
ously promoted the idea, but
In the long run the Columbia
Valley plan was abandoned.
Therefore, the proposal of
Eisenhower to pool not only
the resources but the powers
of the States in a new develop-
ment of this great valley is
most significant.
President Truman reckless-
ly threw around the word "mo-
nopoly," applying it to private
power companies. Of course,
technically no one has denied
that these were monopolies.
They are in the very nature
of things that, but, as in other
cases of natural monopolies,
they are subject to regulation.
The Truman Interior De-
partment plan, however, is to
excoriate these companies and
to substitute for them a Fed-
eral monopoly. This monop-
oly is not to be subject to regu-
lation. And that distinction is
the very heart of the problem.
Eisenhower correctly pointed
this out.
There is no reason to be-
lieve that the Republican Par-
ty will not be active in pro-
moting a sound policy of recla-
mation and river development.
The fact is that most of the
States involved in the Colum-
bia basin have Republican
Governors, and the whole
trend of sentiment up there is
away from the Truman-Interi-
or Department thinking.
Gen. Eisenhower apparently
comprehends all this, for his
speech is a landmark in the
statesmanship of reclamation.
