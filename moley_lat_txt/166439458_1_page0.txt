Eisenhower and Taft
Were Both Too Hasty
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is probable that the first
reaction of most people who
voted for Eisenhower concern-
ing the Durkin appointment
and Taft's brusque comment
thereon was regret over the
haste of both the General and
the Senator.
Certainly that was my own
reaction. For nearly all of us
who worked for the victory in
this election were not moved
by a desire to help any indi-
vidual, but the general wel-
fare of the United States. Any-
thing, therefore, that might
impair the permanent value of
that victory would be regret-
table, perhaps tragic.
For two reasons, however,
I refrained from immediate
comment: first because Eisen-
hower was on his way to a
risky mission to Korea, and
second because I wanted to
learn more of the circum-
stances and to talk with and
get the views of as many
thoughtful people as I could.
It was also my feeling that
the incident would be soon
forgotten because of the burst
of publicity over the Eisen-
hower trip to Korea. The
President-elect is the big news
these days, and whatever he
chooses to emphasize will
take precedence over every-
thing else. That very fact will
go a certain distance in blur-
ring over the Durkin issue, if
it really be an issue.

But the incident and the cir-
cumstances that attended it,
are of sufficient importance to
provide a warning for all con-
cerned—a warning particular-
ly to the President-elect. It
seems that Durkin was decid-
ed upon in a great deal of
haste. Eisenhower was about
to go to Korea and wanted to
get the business of Cabinet-
making over with. Durkin of-
fered at least three qualifica-
tions deemed necessary for
the appointment. He is a Cath-
olic. He is also experienced in
the labor movement, and he
has had service in public of-
fice in the State of Illinois.
Durkin's appointment seems
to have been no more out-
standing than Hoover's Doak
or Roosevelt's Perkins. It was
adequate. It was not incredi-
ble, as Taft put it.
But the failure to consult
the chairman of the Senate
Committee on Education and
Labor, before whom such an
appointment must come, was
incredible. And it was more
incredible since that chair-
man is Taft. The blame for
this must fall upon those up-
on whom Eisenhower must
rely for advice and direction
in such matters.
Until the Durkin appoint-
ment, the selections for the
Cabinet seem to have been
satisfactory to Taft, even
though his recommendations
were not followed.

The ineptness of the people
who seem to have been guid-
ing these appointments for
Eisenhower was further
shown by the fact that Gover-
nor-elect Stratton was con-
sulted about the appointment
of his fellow citizen of Illi-
nois. This neglect of Senator
Dirksen may not have been
due to the animosity of Gov.
Dewey. But it was exceedingly
likely to be interpreted that
way, and those who have
charge of such matters must
consider interpretations as
well as facts.
It has been suggested that
Eisenhower wanted to have a
showdown with Taft early
and to show who is master.
That is ridiculous. A big man
does not consider such a thing,
and an intelligent man would,
after consideration, reject the
idea. Eisenhower is both. Such
an idea would suggest a moth-
er who might expose her child
to the weather on the ground
that the child would have to
have a cold sometime, and it
might as well be sooner as
later.
If we weigh in the scale of
relative importance the two
errors of judgment that seem
to have figured in this affair—
Taft's in being too hasty in
protest and Eisenhower's in
making such a seemingly cas-
ual and hurried appointment—
the latter is far more impor-
tant. A statement by a Sena-
tor is one thing. The act of
a President is another. The
people who loyally fought
through this campaign for
better government deserve
more care in preserving the
fruits of a hard-won victory.
