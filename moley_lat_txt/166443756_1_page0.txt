Reason Comes to Fore'
in the Civil Rights Issue
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Two more signs have ap-
peared in Congress that rea-
son and not passionate and
protracted debate may from
here on attend the perennial
civil rights issue.
The first is that Sen. Hum-
phrey, who has been the
principal proponent of Fed-
eral legislation on the sub-
ject, is now ready to accept
Instead a new civil rights
commission. The other is the
introduction by Sen. Holland
of Florida of a proposed con-
stitutional amendment abol-
ishing the poll tax. He is
joined in this by nine other
southern Senators. Among
them are several who are,
like Holland, distinguished
lawyers.
Sen. Holland, in submitting
his proposal, voices the hope
that speedy action on this
amendment may well be a
means of avoiding long and
bitter debate over Federal leg-
islation on the subject.

The poll tax as a qualifica-
tion to vote has for many
years been regarded as one
of the principal means by
which Negroes are denied
the right to vote in the South.
Otherwise, as a qualification
for voting it has no special
meaning. The tax is small
and its importance as a
source of revenue negligible.
It has been abolished over
most of the South by action
of the States. It still exists
only in Alabama, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Texas and Vir-
ginia. It lingers as a require-
ment in the Constitution of
Tennessee, but legislation
there has made it a dead let-
ter.
One of the points to which

in past years countless hours
of debate in the Senate have
been addressed is whether
the poll tax can be abolished
by an act of Congress. South-
ern members, including Hol-
land, have generally denied
this power. Thus, a constitu-
tional amendment would re-
solve this issue finally and
without debate. Moreover, it
would accomplish a good end
without further extension of
Federal power.

It was, incidentally, Hol-
land himself who assisted in
abolishing the tax in Florida
15 years ago.
The passage of this amend-
ment would at least remove
one of the items of contention
in the civil rights issue, al-
though it is a minor one.
This in itself should be de-
sirable to all concerned, for
it will make it possible to get
closer to the most debatable
of the other items, the FEPC.
On that, the southern mem-
bers of Congress are willing
to fight forever, especially
against a mandatory FEPC
act.
Another of the Truman civ-
il rights proposals, a Federal
"antilynching" act, has lost
its meaning because lynching
has practically disappeared.
The Tuskegee Institute re-
ported no lynchings for 1952
and one in 1951. This indi-
cates that local administra-
tion of criminal law is, so
far as mob violence is con-
cerned, quite effective.
Perhaps the time has come
for a new look at the whole
subject of civil rights, this
time by a commission of
northern and southern lead-
ers selected by President Ei-
senhower.
