A Balanced Budget-
and Lower Taxes, Too
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
What Senators call "the
parliamentary situation" on
tax relief this year can be
summarized as "yes-lf." The
House Ways and Means Com-
mittee by an overwhelming
vote approved the Reed bill,
which would cancel on June
30 the 11% increase in the in-
come tax which took effect
Nov. 1, 1951. The date for the
expiration of that increase
was fixed at Dec. 30. This ac-
tion moves relief ahead by
six months.
That, of course, will not
brighten the skies on March
15 when a lot of us will sud-
denly realize that our tax for
1952 will be relatively higher
than for 1951. That is be-
cause, as indicated above,
the Truman 11% bite applied
to only two months of 1951
income but 12 months of 1952
income.
But beyond that dire date
we may have reason to hope.
For while the President,
Sen. Taft and other leaders
warn us that the budget must
be balanced before taxes can
be reduced, there are several
factors to indicate a good
prospect of lower taxes and
a balanced budget, too.

The House Ways and
Means Committee's action
shows a deep determination
in Congress to bring down
the expense of government
to the taxpayer. This vote,
however, is merely a begin-
ning. The Rules Committee
will tie up the Reed bill un-
til at least May 1, while lead-
ers in Congress and the ad-
ministration have a chance
to see if sufficient cuts can be
made in appropriations. This
is shrewd management by
Messrs. Martin and Taft be-
cause It holds the carrot of
relief before their fellow
members to induce them to
restrain their traditional itch
to spend more than is re-
quested by the President. For
we must always remember
that a Congressman's or a
Senator's desire to spend is
not a partisan matter.
The Ways and Means Com-
mittee, of course, may try to
by-pass the Rules Committee,
but that is not likely.
May 1 or even April 1 may
show the road to a reduction,
for several reasons.
In the first place, the pres-
ent prospects for receipts for
fiscal 1953-54 are based on
Truman estimates. And
Roosevelt-Truman estimates
of receipts had a habit of be-
ing excessively low after
1941. In 10 of those 13 years
they were from 4 to 37%
wrong. In only three fiscal
years, 1949, 1950 and 1953,
were the estimates of receipts
over the actual receipts--by
14, 10 and 3%, respectively.
And 1953 is not over yet.
â˜…
These underestimates of
receipts were due to the fact
that good times pushed in-
comes into higher brackets.
Since 1952 was an excellent
year, we may have a pleasant
surprise in March.
It is also true that an enor-
mous amount of fat can be
cut from budget requests for
spending. Defense and for-
eign aid will certainly be re-
duced, and the public can
have the assurance that it has
a President who will not per-
mit any essential of safety to
be endangered. For the first
time in 20 years we have an
economy-minded Secretary of
the Interior. We know that,
despite the outcries of Demo-
crats, Agriculture Secretary
Benson is no spendthrift, al-
though, it might be added,
he came from Bountiful,
Utah.
Moreover, the last two
budgets have shown astro-
nomical increases in requests.
We should remember that as
late as fiscal 1951 the govern-
ment spent $30,000,000,000
less than the request for the
present fiscal year. A cut-
back of $10,000,000,000 to $15,-
000,000,000 is not only possible
but inevitable. A careful
pruning could accomplish
even more.
Finally, there is the fact
that a tax reduction in and
by itself stimulates economic
life. What is lost to the gov-
ernment from individuals
may well flow through spend-
ing into the profits of corpo-
rations and thus measurably
come back to the Treasury.
