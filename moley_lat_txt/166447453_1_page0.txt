LETTERS TO
EDITORS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Marshall Field laid
the basis of a great retail busi-
ness on the proposition that
the customer is always right,
life was a state of pastoral
simplicity.
Only one customer at a time
had to be satisfied, and hard-
worked and often abused
clerks had to take their medi-
cine. The ultimate was a story
I once heard about a customer
whose money was refunded
for a novel. The complaint
was that the author's ending
of the book was not satisfac-
tory.
But now the case of George
Kaufman, the playwright; the
TV show, "This Is Show Busi-
ness;" the song, "Silent
Night;" the American Tobacco
Co., the sponsor; Batten, Bar-
ton, Durstine & Osborne,
the advertising agency; a
number of citizens variously
estimated at between 200 and
500; another number of citi-
zens which seems to have
been larger than 500 — all
these show how times have
changed since Marshall
Field's store was born.
*
The question now is which
customer is right, and what
is a customer anyhow — the
listeners and viewers who ap-
prove, those who do not ap-
prove, the sponsor, the ad-
vertising agency, or what
else?
Kaufman's remark on Dec.
21 was: "Let's make this one
program on which no one
will sing 'Silent Night, Holy
Night.'" Then 200 to 500 pro-
tests came in, the import of
which was that the remark
was irreligious. Then CBS
dismissed Kaufman from the
show. Then a lot of protests
came in against Kaufman's
dismissal. Then CBS an-
nounced that Kaufman would
be restored to the show and
that the show would be on
a sustaining basis—that is,
without a commercial spon-
sor.
Just how much, if any,
pressure was put on CBS by
the sponsor or advertising
agency is not clearly stated
in any of the accounts I have
seen. CBS clearly assumed
the responsibility for a series
of events which cannot help
but impair the quality of a
medium of entertainment and
instruction that needs all the
improvement that vital, free
minds can give it.
★
And vital, free minds are
not going to give their best
to any enterprise which can
be bullied or blackmailed by
a handful of hysterical lis-
teners, viewers or readers.
One TV critic puts it this
way: "Now television has ad-
vertised to the world that it
is an easy mark for any
small group that wants to
exert its will."
In this case, CBS has mere-
ly compounded its mistake
by reversing itself when a
larger number of customers
voted to keep Kaufman. The
quality of entertainment is
therefore to be a matter of
arithmetic. If 600 telephone
or write they like a show and
500 likewise indicate that
they do not, the show goes
on. The 10,000,000 who heard
and saw and did not tele-
phone are ignored.
Also ignored is the fact
that the management of a
broadcasting company has
the right to an opinion of its
own. And that opinion will
stand if the management has
backbone.
The serious part of this is
the fact that such an exhibi-
tion of weakness by a broad-
casting company encourages
irresponsible people to make
protests. Everyone connect-
ed with the press, and this
writer is no exception, hears
from those people every day.
Only occasionally do we hear
from people who like what
we do.
In a delightful new book
by Harnett Kane, "Dear
Dorothy Dix," a story is told
of that veteran columnist
and dealer with the public.
Someone wrote to her, say-
ing he had read her columns
for a long time, but "yester-
day" he did not agree. Her
comment was that her aver-
age seemed to be good, but
it was interesting to note
that the first time the man
ever wrote was when he dis-
agreed.
