Pessimists who wondered
If a change of party control
could reverse the trend to So-
cialism in Washington should
note what has happened to
controls.
With a directness that can
dispel all doubt, the President
has substituted the control of
money supply for the control
of prices and wages. That is
a basic reversal of policy. And
he has yanked some controls
off without warning, which is
a way of preventing panic
buying and speculation. That
is a fundamental reversal of
method.
This change is exactly what
sound economists have been
urging for years without suc-
cess. It is a wholesome vote
of confidence in a free mar-
ket.
The wise advice that guided
the President's action may
well have come from Treas-
ury Secretary Humphrey and
his special deputy, Randolph
Burgess. At any rate, the
wise thing for any President
to do is to turn to the Treas-
ury for guidance in this field.
Instead of that course, Presi-
dents Roosevelt and Truman
largely ignored the Treasury
and the Federal Reserve
Board and relied upon vari-
ous economic wizards and
crackpots in other sectors of
the government. The result
was inflation, confusion and
burgeoning bureaucracy.
Control of the supply of
money, over the years has
proved to be the only effec-
tive and safe way to master
prices. It is effective mainly
because it is pervasive. It
spreads through the whole
economy and it requires very
little bureaucracy.
It is safe because it has
been used since the days of
Hamilton. It is entirely con-
sistent with the letter and
spirit of the Constitution.
There has been a strong ru-
mor that this new reliance on
a free market checked only
by financial controls will
mean an early reinstatement
of installment credit control
under Regulation W. The vol-
ume of installment buying
has gone up very rapidly
since that form of control
was abandoned. To restore it
would require action by Con-
gress to give the necessary
authority back to the Federal
Reserve Board.
Some basis for this rumor
has been found in the follow-
ing sentence from the Presi-
dent's state of the Union mes-
sage:
"If the freer functioning of
our economic system, as well
as the indirect controls which
can be appropriately em-
ployed, prove insufficient dur-
ing this period of strain and
tension, I shall promptly ask
the Congress to enact such
legislation as may be re-
quired."
Fairly reliable information
from Washington indicates
that a restoration of Regula-
tion W will not be asked for
in the near future or perhaps
ever. The Federal Reserve
Board apparently feels that
Regulation W would be a
nuisance and that it can man-
age credit control by other
means now within its power.
The President's quick ac-
tion in removing some con-
trols is a reversal of former
methods of precipitating buy-
ing sprees by threats and
announcements long before
definite action. This is the
disastrous method called in
prize fighting "telegraphing
your punches." Due to this
absurd habit, inflation often
took its toll long before con-
trols were established.
A free economy is once
more on trial. "For this relief,
much thanks."
