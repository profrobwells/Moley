IT'S WORSE
THAN WAR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A big, husky Air Force
captain was giving advice in
the recreation room of an air
base in South Carolina:
"Whatever you do on this
trip, you avoid the Pennsylvania
Turnpike. Those speed
demons will kill you. Take
the back roads and take it
easy."

For the moment, it seems
ironical to hear this from a
veteran with eight years of
service behind him. He has
piloted almost every contraption
that could get off the
ground.

But this man, who could
be happy in a jet, was in
mortal fear of an automobile.
After the first sense of incongruity
passed, I realized
how right he was. For the
perils of the air are nothing
compared with the terrors of
the road.

A surgeon at the same base
told me that most of his
work was patching up broken
victims of highway accidents.

The contrast between the
war on the highways and
present and past international
conflicts was recently
pointed out in the New York
Times magazine by Robert
Moses, head of New York's
parkway system and of the
Long Island Park Commission.
I doubt if anyone in
America has directed the
planning of so many miles of
parkways over so many years
as Moses. He writes:

"In 1951, 37,000 people died
on the highways. The toll is
expected to reach 38,000 in
1952. Since the beginning of
the Korean conflict, 90,000
lives were crushed out in automobile
accidents, as against
a total of 20,000 Americans
killed in action on the battle
front . . . since the advent
of the motorcar 50 years
ago, 1,000,000 lives, many of
them entirely innocent of
wrongdoing, have been lost
as a result of motor vehicle
accidents.

"By comparison, all of the
wars participated in by the
United States since the War
of Independence 175 years
ago have resulted in 600,000
battle deaths."

Speed is the major reason
for this national tragedy—absurd,
unnecessary, willful, irrational,
selfish speed. The
New York Good Roads Association
presents figures to
show that the States which
permit speeds of more than
50 m.p.h. have nearly twice
the death rate of the four sedate
commonwealths that
keep the limit below 50.

Moses points out that the
death rate on his Long Island
parkways, which maintain
limits of 35 and 40 m.p.h., is
one-eighth of that on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike.
My friend, the Air Force
pilot, had reason and statistics
on his side.

Moses suggests five remedies:
1—Drastically limit speed,
by law and its administration.
2—Stop the advertising of
high-speed motors.
3—Educate the public.
4—Make laws uniform.
5—Promote cooperation
among regulatory agencies.

Gov. Dewey in his annual
message adds these recommendations
to the Legislature
of his State:
1—Require twice-a-year inspection
of automobiles.
2—Make the fixing of traffic
tickets more difficult.
3—Fix mandatory fines
and penalties for serious violations.
4—Expand powers of authorities
to revoke licenses.
5—Re-examine drivers periodically.
6—Increase license fees.
7—Adopt compulsory automobile
insurance.

These are practical measures.
Perhaps while we are
concerning ourselves about
containing Communism
abroad, we might also do
something about the lunatics
at home.
