GOOD OLD
PORK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

MILES CITY, Mont.â€”Amid
a demonstration by a number
of Senators of that delicate
sense of decorum and self-
less regard for others that dis-
tinguishes a crowd of women
at a bargain sale of handbags,
the upper house passed the
appropriations for the Army
Corps of Engineers. The "up-
per" house, as Sen. Douglas
said during the debate, be-
cause it always "upped" the
appropriations passed by the
House.

All but the "trifling" sum
of $12,000,000 of the appro-
priation is for rivers, har-
bors, flood control, and the
generation of electric power.
Long before there was an ex-
ecutive budget this was fa-
miliarly known as the "rivers
and harbors bill" and the ex-
tent to which it was packed
with appropriations inspired
by local political interests
popularized it as the annual
"pork barrel."

The scramble for special lo-
cal concerns is less marked
now, since the initiative
comes from a budget pre-
pared from the national van-
tage point of the White
House. But these bills still
contain plenty of pork.

The break for the taxpayer
in this particular bill is fairly
good, however, for the
amount appropriated is far
below the original Truman
requests.

*

The Truman budget re-
quests for this bill were $683,-
377,000. Gen. Eisenhower,
who is no novice in dealing
with Army spending habits,
slashed this amount to $498,-
650,000. The House cut that
to $416,391,000. The Senate
restored several items and
added a few, bringing it to
$473,762,000. Sen. Knowland,
chairman of the subcommit-
tee in charge, pointed out that
this represented a 5% cut be-
low Eisenhower and 30% be-
low Truman. Altogether, this
is encouraging, considering
the ruthless pressure of lo-
cal interests on Congress and
the President.

Again Congress has shown
a greater disposition for econ-
omy than the President, and
within Congress the House
has been more saving than
the Senate.

As always in the past years,
in the final assault of the
spenders the indefatigable
Sen. Magnuson was well in
front. This time he was vigor-
ously abetted by Morse,
whose violence against Ei-
senhower grows greater by
the day.

Against this assault, Know-
land showed excellent skill in
leadership. It is true that
the bill piloted by Knowland
represented a loss of a siza-
ble part of the economies
achieved by the House, a fact
concerning which Sen. Doug-
las sharply prodded the chair-
man. But as Carlyle said of
Burns, before you pass judg-
ment on a mariner, consider
the length and roughness of
the voyage. In this job Know-
land had to encounter for-
midable pressures for more
spending.

*

Significantly enough, Know-
land's ablest help came from
conservative Democrats from
the South. In that there is
hope that, despite the slim
majority held by the Presi-
dent in the Senate, real help
can come from a coalition.
This will enable him to resist
with some degree of success
the opposition in his own
party, which still would ap-
pease the forces of super-
spending and supergovern-
ment.

Knowland was able to an-
nounce in his report, more-
over, a major concession by
the always politically power-
ful Army Engineers. They
might have been able, de-
spite the new economy wave,
to spend well for years to
come because of their $400,-
000,000 carryover from the
lush Truman years. Know-
land and his committee exact-
ed from them the promise to
reduce this to $100,000,000 in
the next year or two. This
will make possible a closer
control of this very impor-
tant aspect of the budget.
