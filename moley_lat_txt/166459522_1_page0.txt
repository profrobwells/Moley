President Truman in his
speech at the dedication of
the Hungry Horse Dam in
Montana was at his most un-
scrupulous worst.
The infinite meanness and
pettiness of the man are illus-
trated by one feature of the
speech. As many people know,
Harold Ickes, when Secretary
of the Interior and no doubt
with the approval of President
Roosevelt, perpetrated the
small trick of changing the
name of Hoover Dam to Boul-
der Dam. When, after many
years, the Republicans re-
turned to power in the 80th
Congress, they enacted a meas-
ure changing the name back
to Hoover Dam. That is the
name by which it is now offi-
cially known.
★
This act of Congress was not
only a just means of recogniz-
ing the President under whom
the dam was conceived and
for the most part built, but in
line with precedent. There is
a Roosevelt Dam in honor of
T. R. and a Coolidge Dam.There
is also the Franklin D. Roose-
velt Lake above Grand Coulee.
But Truman in this speech
ignored the will of Congress
and in several places in his
speech used the term Boulder
Dam. That this was no mere
slip is proved by two facts.
The first is that the speech was
undoubtedly written by the
staff of Mike Straus, Commis-
sioner of Reclamation, the su-
perpublicity man of the Inte-
rior Department; and second,
the fact that Truman himself
in the speech refers to the
change in name. The political
reason for this is that the in-
tention of this demagogue is
to try to convince the public
on this trip that nothing ex-
cept disaster was ever con-
nected with a Republican ad-
ministration—especially the
Hoover administration.
★
The President really gets
down to his low mark, though.
In his neglect of the truth. He
says that in the 80th Congress
the Republicans took only
one positive action with re-
spect to public power, which
was to change the name of
Boulder Dam to Hoover Dam.
The fact is that the very
dam which Truman was dedi-
cating, Hungry Horse, re-
ceived its first large appropria-
tions from the 80th Congress.
It had been authorized in
1944, but construction was de-
ferred until after the war.
Some small operations were
started in 1946, but the 80th
Congress really got the thing
started with an appropriation
of $17,111,650.
★
This was a larger appropria-
tion than Truman himself re-
quested. He asked for $9,850,-
000 at that time.
The 80th Congress appropri-
ated for the Bureau of Rec-
lamation general fund con-
struction $225,200,000, more
than was requested. For the
maintenance and improve-
ment of rivers and harbors,
there was $273,700,000. For
flood control, $585,000,000.
The solid fact emerges that
the President of the United
States is crossing the country
scattering on all sides not only
the cheapest sort of demagogic
comments but actual viola-
tions of the simple truth.
