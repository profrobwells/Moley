INCURABLE
GRABBERS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This Republican Congress
had hardly got itself organ-
ized before some members be-
gan to violate the spirit if not
the letter of the Republican
platform and the campaign
pledges of Candidate Eisen-
hower. They found many
plausible excuses to ask for
Federal money for one pur-
pose or another.
A notable example was a
statement from a Republican
member of the House, Harry
McGregor of Ohio, chairman
of the House Committee on
Highway Legislation. He
deeply deplored the condition
of highways and called for
bigger Federal aid. This Con-
gressman will find many sup-
porters in both parties for
this grab.

No one can deny that high-
ways need improvement. Nor
can anyone discern any place
or time when it will not be
possible for the Federal gov-
ernment to spend money on
highway extensions.
But these "gimme" Con-
gressmen should realize, and
the President and his Budget
Director should help them
realize, that the Republican
Party is not only pledged to
economy but to return many
activities to the States, along
with the tax sources to pay
for them.
Many Governors have been
preaching this for years.
Their contention is that if the
Federal monster will take its
paws off the gasoline tax, the
States will have plenty of
money for roads and high-
ways. And if ever a function
of government is appropriate
for State and local action,
it is road building.
★
But this is only one of the
many purposes for which lo-
cal communities are reaching
out itching palms. Congress-
men, eager to please, respond
regardless of sound govern-
mental principles, pledges, or
financial solvency. It may be
added that one of the favorite
organs for the expression of
local craving is the Chamber
of Commerce of the commu-
nity.
Members of such bodies
have regularly attended meet-
ings and have vigorously ap-
plauded attacks on Federal
corruption and extravagance.
But when local needs appear,
their presidents and secretar-
ies take the first train to
Washington to wait on their
Congressmen and Senators.
★
A notable deviation from
this rule is expressed in a
resolution passed last year
by the Denver Chamber of
Commerce. The following ex-
tracts might well be pon-
dered by all local interests
everywhere:
"Whereas, there has devel-
oped in our country during
the last 20 years a highly
centralized national govern-
ment which has built a tre-
mendous and far-flung pro-
gram of Federal loans and
grants in aid to the States,
cities, counties and towns,
along with an expanded pro-
gram of public works of var-
ious kinds; and
"Whereas, States and local
communities needing funds
for these purposes have fall-
en into the habit of looking
to Washington for financial
help for projects, the devel-
opment and construction of
which formerly were depend-
ent on local decision and lo-
cal ability to finance and pay
for
"Whereas, in these critical
times it is necessary for all
citizens of this country to put
first things first, which means
putting the good of the coun-
try as a whole ahead of sec-
tional, State and city inter-
ests and evaluating all local
propositions from this view-
point for the duration of the
defense effort,
★
"Therefore, Be It Resolved:
that the board of directors
of the Denver Chamber of
Commerce will not ask, or
support others asking, the
Federal Congress through
our political representatives
or in any other manner, for
financial aid or legislation
for the purpose of building
any public structures, or to
further enlarged welfare or
social-gain projects, or to in-
itiate or further any project
of any kind, solely for the
benefit of the community.
"And Be It Further Re-
solved: That this statement
stand as the policy of the
Denver Chamber of Com-
merce, regardless of wheth-
er Chambers in other places
adopt similar policies, be-
cause our times require a def-
inite stand on what is right
and what is wrong. This we
believe to be right and will
stand upon it."
