In Whittaker Chambers'
unforgettable account of his
servitude to and deliverance
from Communism, in his
book, "Witness," he made the
important point that his most
potent enemies after his rev-
elations broke were not Com-
munists but those who in
the name of liberalism have
for 20 years been seeking to
take over our form of gov-
ernment and economic life.
Ill and on his back recov-
ering from a heart attack,
Chambers now returns to the
theme in an article in Life
magazine. Again his style is
moving and his psychological
insight powerful. He is con-
sidering what he calls "the
liberal nettrosis" in the face of
the current Congressional in-
vestigations.
★
He illustrates this by a
statement of Robert M.
Hutchins, formerly of the
Ford Foundation, that profes-
sors are "silenced"-by-the
general atmosphere of repres-
sion. If they are silenced,
then a lot of people who
sound like professors are
making a lot of noise.
★
Prof. H. S. Commager of
Columbia says that "teach-
ers fear to discuss certain
subjects in the classroom."
This is sheer nonsense. I
have been a professor at Co-
lumbia more than twice as
long as Commager and I have
never known a time when
professors were talking more
politics, in class and outside.
In fact, students in some de-
partments seem to be hear-
ing-I say hearing, not learn-
ing-more about McCarthy
that about the subjects for
which they came to college.
Two weeks ago we heard
cries from the librarians and
book publishers that people
are too scared to read. Last
week the educators told us
that people don't dare to
speak. What next?
★
But despite the obvious ab-
sence of any threat and cer-
tainly with no real evidence
of a gag, why the hysteria?
Whittaker Chambers an-
swers that these cries are
"the voices of the liberal neu-
rosis . . . not because liberals
are Communists but because
of a deep political insecu-
rity." They fear to be mis-
taken for Communists be-
cause of the sharp resem-
blance between the Commu-
nist state and that goal of the
liberals, the welfare state.
"The ends each has in view
have much in common." They
are "in fact, in direct compe-
tition" with each other.
"That family resemblance is
nerve wearing . . . so at every
move toward Communism,
liberal nerves become un-
glued."
★
Chambers, of course, uses
the word "liberal" to describe
people who so designate
themselves. The historic
meaning of a liberal is pre-
cisely the opposite of one
who favors Socialism in any
form.
While Chambers is right in
this general appraisal, an-
other point is very pertinent.
The "liberal" offers his plans
for a welfare state as a com-
promise with Communism.
He says to the citizen: "Com-
munism offers you Utopia
based on Marx. It says that
a free economy is doomed and
that we had better liquidate
it completely. We agree that
economic liberty is decadent
and dated, but we will extin-
guish it by degrees. Our way
is easy, bloodless, gradual."
★
This is appeasement. It is
not resistance. It cannot suc-
ceed because with every con-
cession the forces against a
free economy become strong-
er. The resistance weakens.
It is like yielding to black-
mail. Once you pay, you
must always pay.
As a means of resisting
Communism, Fabianism, wel-
fareism will always fail. Ke-
rensky will yield to Lenin.
Attlee to Bevan.
Only an assertion of the
virtues of a genuine free
economy can prevail against
Communism. For it is not
decadent. It is, if we would
only give it a chance, in the
full strength of youth.
