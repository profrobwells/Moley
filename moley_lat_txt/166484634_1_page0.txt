THE LAST
PHASE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

An revolutions—bloody
ones like those of Russia and
France, peaceful ones like the
New Deal—have their years
on the stage of history, ac-
complish changes for good or
bad, and then lesser leaders
unsuccessfully attempt to
stay in power on the basis of
the frail memory and ca-
pricious gratitude of the pub-
lic. Is there any reason to
believe that the vast upheav-
al that began 36 years ago
will be an exception?
Perhaps I should say that
I have no intention of de-
pending on the dangerous
but very common practice of
leaning heavily on supposed
historical parallels in at-
tempting to predict the fu-
ture. The past falls as a
guide because what we read
in history may not be the
whole story or an accurate
account of what happened.

Also, we cannot give exact
weight to changed conditions.
But, on the other hand, his-
tory helps us because it can
give us clues on the basis of
which we can seek more in-
telligently to judge the pres-
ent.
There is no question but
that the force of a revolu-
tionary upheaval is, in terms
of history, short-lived.
Then, if there is no counter-
revolution, the ruling group
settles down to the often rest-
less job of running the gov-
ernment. The grand senti-
ments which once stirred the
public are repeated over and
over. But the response grows
less and less as conditions
change, as those people who
were once moved by the battle
cry grow older or die, and as
the young cannot understand
the factors in the old regime
that kindled the flame.

*

Now let us consider the
situation facing the rulers of
the U.S.S.R. in the light of the
foregoing pattern of revolu-
tionary history.
In the 36 years since the
Czar was dethroned, a new
generation has been born and
has grown to maturity. Those
who had reached maturity in
1917 are dead or well past
their peak of productivity or
influence. Very few, except
a handful of old revolution-
ists, like Vishinsky, can re-
member the Czarist regime or
can hate or dread the condi-
tions that prevailed then.
Those who cannot remem-
ber the empire have been well
indoctrinated, it is true. But
they have no emotional rea-
son to love the Communist
creed. It is something to take
for granted or to live with.
And it is the way of human
nature to be unhappy with
prevailing conditions. True,
those conditions are well ad-
vertised as fine and as the
product of Communist rulers.
But if those who are living
under them are not desirous
of something better, they are
violating the basic factor in
human nature that makes
survival and progress possi-
ble.

*

Meanwhile, those who rule
have nothing to offer but
more of the same and also, as
a means of discipline, the ter-
ror of a police state. Stalin
could be secure because he
had become a symbol of na-
tional unity and a source of
patriotic fervor. That cannot
be so with those who suc-
ceed him.
And so with a spent revolu-
tion on their hands and with
an overextended control in
lands to which the anteced-
ents of the 1917 revolution
mean nothing, the state of
those rulers must be uneasy.
This does not mean an up-
heaval in Russia itself. But it
means less power to hold
those areas and allegiances on
the extremities. It is in that
periphery that we will first
see the decline of Communist
power.
