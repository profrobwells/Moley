Give Congress Credit:
It HAS Economized
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From time immemorial
Congress has been charged
with a mania for spending
taxpayers' money.
Even now, with a Congress
pledged almost to a man to
economy, there are those
who are saying that the
Eisenhower administration is
being frustrated by Congress
in its efforts to save. Local
selfish interests, they say,
put the heat on Congress-
men, and through the an-
cient art of logrolling the
Congressmen oblige. The re-
sult is increases over the
amounts requested by the ex-
ecutive departments.
The evidence so far denies
this charge against Congress.
It can be shown that gener-
ally this year Congress has
been more economical than
the executive departments
and the President's Budget
Bureau.
I say the evidence "so far"
because until the last appro-
priation bill has been passed
by the Senate some weeks
hence we shall not know
the score.
As of mid-June, the Appro-
priations Committees of Con-
gress had reduced every ma-
jor appropriation bill, with
the single exception of the
one dealing with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. In that
case, the final action has
been taken by the Senate.
The final figure was $33,000-
000 under the Truman re-
quest, and $8,000,000 over
the Eisenhower revision.
The House did very well
with the second independent
offices appropriation bill. It
cut $1,200,000,000 below Tru-
man's request and $327,000.-
000 below Eisenhower's. This
bill covers the TVA, veter-
ans, Selective Service, and
atomic energy.
The first independent offic-
es bill, which covers the
Civil Service Commission
and general services, was
slashed to almost exactly
half of the Eisenhower re-
quest and to 40% of the
Truman request.
The big Interior Depart-
ment was allowed $607,000.-
000 in the Truman budget,
$484,000,000 in Eisenhower's.
The House slashed the latter
by almost 20% but the Sen-
ate Appropriations Commit-
tee added $45,000,000. It will
probably end up about $30.-
000,000 under the Eisenhower
request.

It is not easy to cut the
various welfare expenditures
because of fixed require-
ments, but so far the House
seems to have saved $100-
000,000.
There was a healthy cut on
the well-upholstered State
Department. Truman asked
$151,000,000; Eisenhower,
$131,000,000. Final action by
the Senate allowed $92,000,-
000. Justice and Commerce
also suffered cuts. Likewise,
Treasury and Post Office.
In reviewing these figures,
it should be noted that the
big fellows are yet to come
in defense and foreign aid.
But so far, the result is
fairly encouraging.
It must be remembered in
assessing responsibility that
the new Eisenhower depart-
ment heads are laboring un-
der a great handicap in re-
vising their predecessors'
budgets. There are thousands
of items to be reviewed,
hundreds of nooks and cran-
nies to be looked into. And
in their labors they must for
the most part depend upon
holdover subordinates who
were part of the Truman
spending machine. Congres-
sional committees can use
the ax with greater freedom.
But for the moment, the
economy prize goes to the
old, much-abused Congress.
