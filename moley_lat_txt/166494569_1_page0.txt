UNDER
THE RUG
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We are told, in a lively se-
ries of pictures in a national
magazine, about the busy
days of a social secretary in
the household of Secretary
of State Dulles. One of them
shows the young lady in a
bookstore buying whodunits
for "Cousin Foster's" idle
hours.
I would like to suggest to
Cousin Foster a book that I
found vastly more exciting
than anything I have read
since "Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea." It is
a bulky volume containing
780 pages of hearings by a
subcommittee of the Senate
Appropriations Committee on
the budget of the Depart-
ment of State.
This is the first time that
there has been a real exami-
nation of this vast, shapeless
bureaucracy that once was
an American Foreign Office.
Eight members of the sub-
committee—Sens. Bridges,
Ferguson, Knowland, Mundt,
Dirksen, McCarthy, McCar-
ran and Ellender—were fair-
ly familiar with State De-
partment affairs and were, in
their searching questions,
none too tender with the
partment. They were helped
this time by the presence at
the head of the State De-
partment delegation of Don-
ald B. Lourie, an able busi-
ness executive who is the
new Undersecretary of State
for administration.

Anything like an adequate
review of these hearings
could hardly fit this space,
but one or two examples of
the state into which the
department has fallen will
suffice.
The first had to do with a
simple matter of economy.
Lourie testified that he
found that "practically ev-
erything was sent by cable."
He decided that a cut of 25%
could be made in that item
alone simply by using air
mail. Sen. Ellender pointed
out that the last year a sin-
gle cable "to settle one lit-
tle item" cost $500. And add-
ed that it could have been
done with a 6-cent stamp.

Next, the indescribable
confusion that attends the so-
called Point 4 program came
out. No less than 50 agencies
of government have people
abroad doing Point 4 work,
whatever that is. These peo-
ple are abroad in great num-
bers, and the State Depart-
ment is supposed to know
what is happening wherever
they are. But Edward B.
Wilber, budget officer of the
State Department, confessed
that he did not know that
the other Washington de-
partments each had a sepa-
rate unit for Point 4 work.
Then there were the mili-
tary attaches to be consid-
ered. Of course, the custom
is to have at least three in
each capital—one each for
the Navy, Army and Air,
even in places where one
could learn all that might be
necessary. In fact, there is a
naval attache in one country
that has no navy. In anoth-
er spot, in South America,
the Army alone has seven at-
taches, with four automobiles
to run around with.
★
The State Department has
no control over the attaches.
They are paid and kept by
the Defense Department. The
State Department merely pro-
vides "housekeeping" for
them. But a number of these
attaches have planes in which
Embassy people can on oc-
casion get passage.
In 1945 the State Depart-
ment employed 9200 people.
After eight years, it has 42,-
000.
All agencies of our govern-
ment have 114,407 people em-
ployed abroad.
Inevitably, the hearings got
around to the number of
State Department employees
discharged for a reason gen-
erally regarded in this coun-
try as immoral and whose
unfortunate weakness makes
them bad security risks.
Sen. Bridges revealed that
since 1947 there have been
425 dismissals for that rea-
son alone.
★
Then the discussion turned
to the reason why the State
Department has such an at-
traction for such people.
Lourie ventured the theory
that they wanted jobs where
they could travel. They pre-
fer, he said, to live in coun-
tries that are likely to con-
done their weakness. For
this, the taxpayer must pay.
This book, which should
supply the Secretary of State
with plenty of spare-time
reading, might well be placed
in the reading rooms of all
the libraries in the land. It
shows what can happen to
our country under a "liberal"
administration.
