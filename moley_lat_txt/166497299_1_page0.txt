MAKING ENDS MEET
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In two previous articles I
have attempted to make two
points. First, the efforts of
the administration to reduce
expenditures have not been
effective. Second, the forces
working against economy
cannot be met except by drastic
action. In this article I
shall describe what such
drastic action should be.
In the last days of the recent
session of Congress, the
powerful House Committee
on Government Operations
reported out with approval
HR 2—a bill which had been
introduced and pressed
against administration opposition
by Frederic R. Coudert
Jr., a Republican from New
York. This bill was not
passed, but it will be a basic
fighting issue when Congress
returns in January.
The discouraging progress
of economy has brought me
to believe that among all the
plans to balance the Federal
budget and relieve the taxpayer
this is the soundest and
the best.
*
The Coudert bill as amended
by the Committee on Government
Operations is very
simple. It declares that the
"expenditures of the government
during each fiscal year
shall not exceed its revenues
for such year except (1) in
time of war declared by the
Congress; or (2) during a
period of grave national
emergency declared by the
Congress by a concurrent
resolution." It directs the
President to prepare the
budget in line with this policy.
It authorizes the President
at any time during the
year, in order to keep the
budget in balance, to withhold
the spending of money
already appropriated "by
placing funds in reserve, by
apportionment of funds, or
otherwise."
The latter is very great
discretionary power. It
means that in order to
achieve the purposes of Congress
in this bill the President
may withhold or reduce
any appropriation or even
the payment of money due
under contracts already
made.
*
This bill, to be sure, if
passed, would be a self-
denying ordinance. It could
be repealed by Congress at
any time. A constitutional
amendment would be better
and, in fact, Coudert has also
introduced the exact language
of this bill as a proposed
constitutional amendment.
But an enactment of this
kind has a certain standing
in terms of principle not enjoyed
by ordinary legislation.
For it is, like the fixing of
the debt ceiling by law, a solemn
declaration of government
policy enacted at the
instance of the House, in
which all bills for raising
revenue must originate. Such
a law would be a rule of interpretation
paramount to all
appropriations.
*
The seriousness with
which Congress regards the
debt ceiling, which it also
passed as a self-denying act,
shows the moral authority of
such legislation. The British
limitations upon appropriating
power are only custom
but are scrupulously observed.
In arguing for this bill,
Roswell Magill, former Under-
secretary of the Treasury
and president of the Tax
Foundation, said: "A balanced
budget is not beyond the
reach of the Federal government.
It is not generally realized
that most of the States
bar deficit financing or debt
creation for current operations
through a constitutional
limitation. Most of our cities
also strictly limit debt."
Like all people when they
are invested with public office,
the people in the Eisenhower
administration are impatient
of restraints. John
Foster Dulles in 1952 felt
that there was peril in the
treaty power, but Secretary
Dulles in 1953 says all is well
—"Don't fence me in." Secretary
Humphrey opposes what
he calls the "inflexible" limits
of the Coudert bill. But,
as I show above, the bill actually
gives the Secretary,
acting under Presidential authority,
more power than he
now has.
The Director of the Budget,
in a letter to the Government
Operations Committee, says
that he does not believe expenditures
can be controlled
by "arbitrarily" limiting them
"in any given period." This
objection can be avoided by
the bill as amended unless
he means that there should
be no balance in any specific
period. If that is what he
means, he has been taken
over by the old New Dealers
in his bureau who for many
years have been advocating
fiscal periods of five or more
years for budget-balancing
purposes. That, incidentally,
was a theory held by Rex
Tugwell when he was in the
government several years
ago.
Since there is nothing very
flexible in the limits placed
upon the taxpayer, it seems
to me that the taxgatherer
should be limited, too.
