OUR TROUBLED BRITISH FRIENDS
Sen, William Knowland,
after something more than
seven and a half years of
service in the Senate of the
United States, received in the
California primaries a year
ago something like 2,500,000
votes.
Not only did he receive
hoth nominations, but his ma-
jority over his opponent was
more than 1,600,000 votes.
This was probably the great-
est vote of confidence ever
given a public official in the
United States, with the ex-
ception of a President or
Vice-President.
â˜…
In the course of my trip,
I have traveled across Cali-
fornia and have talked with
a good many people and have
found Knowland's standing
in the State higher than ever.
I offer this estimate to make
the point that when Sen.
Knowland speaks he is an
authentic representative of a
great State. That State never
has been designated as anti-
British, nor has there ever
been applied to it the snide
characterization "isolation-
ist." Knowland's scathing de-
nunciation of Clement Att-
lee's recent speech in Parlia-
ment was truly the expres-
sion of a great and genuine
American voice.
Knowland's speech, how-
ever, was delivered so soon
after that of Attlee that it is
probable that he had no more
than a brief newspaper sum-
mary of what the Socialist
leader said. Had he read the
entire Attlee speech, his an-
ger would have been in no
wise less, and his material
for criticism would have been
vastly greater.
For seldom has an expres-
Knowland
sion of a British statesman
been so full of misapprehen-
sions of American opinion
and so reeking with the gum-
my drip of condescension as
that speech of the representa-
tive of a divided, defeated and
discredited party. Some of
Attlee's points deserve em-
phasis in the United States
so that they may be remem-
bered if by some tragic mis-
chance this man should once
more become Prime Minister
of our ally, Great Britain.
Most serious at this mo-
ment was Attlee's effort to
discredit and weaken our rep-
resentative at the truce talks
in Korea, Gen. Harrison. Att-
lee said the general "seemed
to make observations of his
own, right off his own bat."
In short, that was to tell the
Communists that they are
dealing with an irresponsible
blabbermouth and not to be-
lieve that he represents allied
opinion. Any American's
blood pressure should rise
at Attlee's aside on this. It
is, he said, "in the American
tradition."
Attlee got completely off
base when he said in effect
that Eisenhower is not
master in his own house and
that his recent speech did not
represent American opinion.
But in answer to Attlee's as-
sertion that some elements in
the United States do not want
peace, Eisenhower has denied
this, and he spoke for a
united country.
Attlee, whose mind is
heavily laden with Socialist
sophistry and Marxian in-
terpretations of history, as-
serted that "the American
Constitution was framed for
an isolationist state." Rather,
we should say, it was framed
for an infant nation that at
that moment was surrounded
by a number of the most
rapacious empires in history,

one of which was our present
uneasy ally. But to prove
that we were hardly willing
to remain at home even then,
we moved into the Eastern
Hemisphere and cleared out
the Barbary pirates, a bit of
policing which had been neg-
Attlee
lected by the mistress of the
seas.
The point of Attlee's speech
was to emphasize that "one
of the disadvantages of Amer-
ican democracy is that it is
sometimes hard to find where
effective power lies." What he
really meant was that when
he used to come over here
fishing for something it was
sometimes hard to find exact-
ly where the suckers were
biting the best.
