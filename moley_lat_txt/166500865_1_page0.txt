President Eisenhower
shows real political courage
in regarding TVA as some-
thing that is subject to criti-
cism as well as praise. His
characterization, "creeping
Socialism," is exact. And he
said more that makes excel-
lent sense. The TVA, he said,
is a "monopoly" which the
Federal government has
"seized," and now the TVA
people want more money to
bring more industries there.
This, he explained, means
in simple terms the Social-
istic theory that all of us—
the people of the United
States—should pay a subsidy
through taxes to take indus-
tries from New England and
elsewhere to enrich and pro-
vide jobs in a selected section
of the country.
He is not, he added, out to
destroy TVA as an "experi-
ment." But he might have
added that the "infant experi-
ment" has outgrown its hob-
by sox now and is a vast, sub-
sidized monopoly.
At long last a President has
had the courage to submit
this sacred cow to realistic
evaluation. It has been the
subject of panegyrics for
years. New Deal semantics
lavished its choicest frosting
upon it. It has been called
"democracy in action," "an
experiment in regionalism"
and other sweet-sounding
terms. It is the complete an-
tithesis of democracy. It is
state paternalism in which
all the people support some
of the people. It is not region-
alism. It is federalism.
Over and over, it has been
extolled by the academic
pundits, and many Ph.D.s
and M.A.s have been earned
by writing theses about it.
School children up to and in-
cluding college age have
been taken on Easter holi-
day pilgrimages there, ac-
companied by Socialistic pro-
fessors who know nothing of
the engineering or bookkeep-
ing problems involved. There,
in calf-eyed wonder, these
well-indoctrinated children
have looked upon the works
of F. D. R. with the same
reverence that they evince
on the way home at Mt. Ver-
non or Monticello.
Much more sinister have
been the vicious attacks up-
on journalists and others
who have ventured to tell the
whole truth about TVA. Only
a few hardy souls like John
T. Flynn have ventured to
criticize this New Deal
shrine. The letters that no
doubt come from government-
inspired sources to a critic
beggar description.
If we write a word of com-
mendation of private vs. pub-
lic power anywhere we are
"paid prostitutes of the pow-
er trust." Legal action against
such irresponsible sources is
impossible. Our editors are
deluged with long letters
from public officials, written
at public expense, question-
ing our facts, our motives,
our integrity.
And the flame of moh
psychology is fanned by such
mouthings as those of Wayne
Morse in denouncing Secre-
tary McKay for his action on
the proposed Federal dam in
Hell's Canyon.
The President has cleared
the air. Now let's all of us
judge these electric-power
problems on their merits and
without fear.
