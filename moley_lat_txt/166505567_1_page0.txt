A virile politico-social institution like New York's
Tammany takes a long time to
decline and die, especially
when nothing new and vital
and growing is there to take
its place.
Somehow it struggles along
on bits of legitimate patronage and the nauseous fruits
of ignorance, apathy and corruption. It seemed from time
to time during the last few
years that Tammany had become such a bargain as to be
picked up on the open market by Frank Costello and
associated beneficiaries of
gambling. At any rate, William O'Dwyer, when Mayor
of New York, was in part
mortgaged to such interests.
The decline of the Democratic organization throughout
the five boroughs was
dramatically shown in a primary last week, held on the
same day when the embattled but bedraggled hosts of
the party men were breathing fire in Chicago. Apathy
prevailed everywhere in New
York.
The prize was the office of
Mayor, which has tremendous
power and spoils—a prize
which should energize the
most benumbed and passion-
less of politicians. But in the
aggregate the associated district leaders on both sides of
the primary contest were
able to bring to the polls only
one of every four registered
Democrats.
The rivals were Mayor Vincent Impellitteri who was
supported by the leaders of
three of the boroughs—Kings,
Queens and Richmond—and
Robert Wagner Jr., who was
supported by the leaders of
Manhattan and the Bronx.
Actively thumping their
drumlets for the son of the
late Sen. Wagner were Sen.
Lehman, Averell Harriman
and F.D.R. Jr.
James A. Farley supported
Impellitteri, thus seeking to
regain primacy in the State's
Democratic organization. This
was interpreted as a conservative reaction against New
Dealism. But no one took that
very seriously.
Voters sick of the financial
deficiencies of the city, of
dirty streets, dope peddling,
traffic congestion and bad
transportation generally simply ignored the primaries.
The weakness of district
leaders is vividly shown in
the returns. Impellitteri had
60% of the leaders, but they
were able to get to the polls
only 181,295 votes. Any such
weakness in summoning the
docile to a primary in the
puissant Charles F. Murphy's
day would have resulted in
rolling heads.
Take a few isolated examples. In a teeming district
in Harlem, where Republicans are scarce as two-headed
infants, there were only 3365
Democrats who cared to
vote. In 1952, 14,628 Democrats voted. In a jam-packed
district adjoining, largely
Puerto Rican, only 5038 Democrats voted this time. In
1952 in that district 17,415
voted.
The verdict must be that
the Democratic leadership is
lamentably weak, that voters
are no longer following any
leaders and that the mass of
Democrats are ashamed of
their own city government.
Against Wagner there will
run Harold Riegelman, an
able and respected Republican; Rudolph Halley, a Liberal who is now president of
the Council and a candidate
of the American Labor Party.
Both Riegelman and Halley
seem to have a chance to defeat Wagner, for once more
Tammany seems to be on the
verge of defeat.
