Movie Men's Choice:
a Code or a Censor
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two headlines in Daily
Variety, published in Los An-
geles, mark the beginning
and the end of a story which
has important artistic,
moral and political signifi-
cance.
The first headline in the
issue of March 4, 1953, was
"Pix Prod'n Code on Way
Out." The second, on Aug. 13,
1953, was "Prod'n Code Will
Stick as Is." This specific
issue arose over a play and
picture called "The Moon Is
Blue."
A producer first submitted
the successful Broadway play
of that name two years ago
to the Production Code Ad-
ministration, variously known
as the Hays, Johnston, or
Breen office. The administra-
tion said that it was in viola-
tion of the code, a standard
of propriety adopted by the
Motion Picture Association of
America long ago as a guide
by and to all major com-
panies.
Â¥
The association, it should
be noted, was and is com-
posed of the major com-
pantes. The producer of "The
Moon Is Blue" was not a mem-
ber of the association. Despite
the administration's opinion,
he had a script made and sub-
mitted it some months later.
Again, the code administra-
tion refused to approve it-
in part, because of some of
the dialogue, but fundamen-
tally because it was said to
violate sections of the code
which say that "pictures shall
not infer that low forms of
sex relationship are the ac-
cepted or common thing" and
that seduction shall never be
the proper subject for
comedy.
The producer held that his
script did not violate the code
and proceeded to make the
picture, which he submitted
to the administration. The
administration refused its
seal of approval and the pro-
ducer took an appeal to the
board of directors of the as-
sociation, which upheld the
code administration. The
picture was then exhibited in
such theaters as were avail-
able to a picture thus banned,
with advertising saying that
it is an "adult" film or "for
adults only."
At this point I wish to state
that I am not discussing the
specific moral or artistic is-
sues involved. I am con-
cerned with the wisdom of
private business regulating it-
self as an alternative to reg-
ulation by the heavy hand
of the state. On that point I
wrote a book some years ago
called "The Hays Office,"
which, I may say, met the
approval of the trade press
in the motion-picture indus-
try as a fair and authentic
portrayal of the problem.
In the present case of "The
Moon Is Blue," left-wing writ-
ers proceeded to go far be-
yond criticism of the specific
decision of the code adminis-
tration and raised a cry for
the abolition of the whole sys-
tem of self-regulation. This
demand was slapped down by
the directors of the associa-
tion on Aug. 12. Through
their president, Eric John-
ston, it was made clear that
the code and its administra-
tion would continue.
It has taken many years
for the heads of the motion-
picture industry to build the
faith they now have in their
code. But it is now a mighty
conviction, a conviction based
upon the two propositions
which went into the making
and adoption of the code 25
years ago.
*
The first of those proposl-
tions is that unless there is
self-regulation the pressure
of religious bodies, parent
groups and other sectors of
American opinion will have
recourse to the government
for the protection of the
morals of those who make up
the immense mass audience
of motion pictures. The other
proposition is that in a highly
competitive industry the in-
dividual cannot exercise self-
censorship alone. To be frank,
the members of a competitive
industry cannot trust each
other and must, if there is to
be regulation, resort to joint
action.
It is true that there will be
differences of opinion as to
whether this or that picture
should be shown. But some
authority must exercise the
prudential decision, and in
this case it was the code ad-
ministration.
