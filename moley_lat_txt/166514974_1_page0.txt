PARTY MAN
CHURCHILL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Whatever may be the in-
firmities of a body from
which too much has been ex-
pected over many years,
there is nothing wrong with
Sir Winston Churchill's mind.
His speech at the Conserva-
tive Party's conference at
Margate was not only a stim-
ulating call to party action
but one of the best state-
ments of the Conservative
faith that we have heard in
recent years.
The part of the speech that
dealt with foreign policy mo-
nopolized the headlines, com-
ing as it did at a moment
when the American public is
disturbed by the confusion of
voices in Washington regard-
ing the H-bomb and our de-
fenses against it. But two-
thirds of the speech dealt
with domestic policy and with
the gains made by Britain
since the Attlee government
fell in 1951.

Those who say cynically
that the Conservative Party
has adopted most of the so-
cial and economic reforms ad-
vocated by the Socialists
should read this speech with
care. They will see, if they
do so, that a wide chasm of
principle still separates the
two parties.
True, the Conservatives
have accepted social "insur-
ance" in most of its aspects.
But, except for free medical
service, these were inherited
not from the Socialists but
from the Lloyd George Lib-
erals. They have accepted the
responsibility of building
houses through government
enterprise. But that is a con-
dition forced upon any gov-
ernment after the decay and
devastation of wars and prep-
aration therefor.
Another compromise is a
limited participation in the
food market. Owing to many
factors, largely the war and
the Socialist effort to prolong
war controls, there is still a
Food Ministry and a limited
and declining process of buy-
ing and distributing food. Ag-
riculture is assisted and con-
trolled to a degree somewhat
more than in the United
States. But interference with
the free market in agricul-
ture is based upon the same
factor that influences the
American market—the fluctu-
ations of world prices.
Beyond that the Conserva-
tive policy is to interpose a
firm opposition to nationaliza-
tion. Coal and the railways,
says Churchill, will stay na-
tionalized. But there the
march of the state must stop.
And, despite doubts, his gov-
ernment has succeeded in de-
nationalizing steel and trans-
port. Churchill is probably
indulging in no mere political
oratory when he adds that the
British people have had
enough of nationalization.

In his use of terms he is far
more outspoken than most
Republican speakers in this
country. He says the British
stand for "independence."
That would be hooted at here
as "isolationist." He says his
party stands for "free enter-
prise." That, too, is taboo in
our politics.
I am a bit annoyed at his
use of the term "Tory democ-
racy." It is apparently a po-
litical confection. The two
words, if they have not ceased
to have meaning, are inimical
one to the other.
The term is no worse, how-
ever, than the product of the
ghost writer who had Presi-
dent Eisenhower say that he
was "liberal," "progressive"
and "conservative"—all in
one breath. That generaliza-
tion in the Boston speech was
qualified by a special defini-
tion of each word. But when
everyone makes up his own
definitions we shall have no
common language at all.
The Conservative faith as
stated by the Prime Minister
is simple. It holds with "free
and flexible working of the
laws of supply and demand,"
limited only by the responsi-
bility of the state to prevent
disaster, individual or nation-
al.
This is a faith to stand by
and to measure every act of
government. It is much more
robust and meaningful than
some of our statesmen's defi-
nition of their faith in mere
freedom. We need, also, to
know what we are free from
and what limits we shall put
upon ourselves. Mere free-
dom is an ideological vacuum.
