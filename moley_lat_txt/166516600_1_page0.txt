AND THE BUREAUCRATS
ARE STILL THERE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The new estimates of
spending and receipts just
issued by President Eisen-
hower's Budget Bureau are
no doubt designed to cheer
us. At any rate, they have
been accompanied by loud
huzzahs by such loyal Repub-
licans as Speaker Martin and
Leader Halleck.
But the words of praise
must have seared the well-
worn throats of those states-
men. For they must know
that, despite these figures,
the progress toward reliev-
ing the aching backs of tax-
payers has been meager. In
fact, I have found in my
travels over the country this
summer a dawning convic-
tion that much of the talk
last year about economy was
mere campaign oratory. I am
convinced that unless some-
thing drastic is done, neither
this administration nor any
other that we may elect will
ever reform itself.
A careful examination of
the earlier budget figures sub-
mitted by the President and
his Budget Director shows
that most of the cuts below
the earlier Truman estimates
were in defense requests.
This was easy to do for two
reasons.

★

First, Truman inserted into
the budget certain requests
that he knew would perish
in January. He put in every-
thing he could think of to
show his goodwill to grasp-
ing communities and politi-
cians. If there were to be
aching hearts, he was deter-
mined that somebody else
would get the blame.
Second, $80,000,000,000 had
already been appropriated
and not spent. For in previ-
ous years the capacity of Con-
gress to appropriate had far
outrun the capacity of our
economic system to produce.
And so an administration
would have to be blind and
deaf not to be able to cut
billions from the Truman
estimates. It was the House
of Representatives that did
the really serious cutting.
For the boys there have to
face angry taxpayers at
home.
The real determination of
an admistration to cut spend-
ing is reflected in the number
of civil employees it is will-
ing to fire. That is not the
full measure of the cost of
government, but it reflects
the extent to which spenders
are going to be allowed to
hold their jobs.
The record in reducing
such employees is not so
good. The able and indefati-
gable Sen. Byrd released fig-
ures at the end of July which
show that in five months the
adminstration has reduced
the burden of 2,550,000 civil
employees by only 3% and
most of those were in the
Defense Department.

★

In June I wrote an article
concerning the failure of the
absurdly overgrown State De-
partment to reduce its waste-
ful employment. An official
of that department wrote a
letter to a friend of mine com-
plaining that I had been un-
fair to the new people brought
in by the President and Dul-
les. He said that they had cut
a great deal—specifically, 827
employees. However, that fig-
ure amounted to about 2% of
the number employed by the
department in 1952. Now, the
department says that it will
have got rid of about 1100 by
November. That will still be
less than 3%.
The American people are
not going to be happy about
2 or 3% economies. Not when
taxes compel them to deny
themselves far more than that
in what they want to spend
or save.
Drastic compulsion is what
a bureaucracy needs. In an-
other article I shall call at-
tention to the violent opposi-
tion, including propaganda,
that has greeted the cuts al-
ready made. After that, I
shall describe what seems to
me the only way to hold a
bureaucracy in check.
