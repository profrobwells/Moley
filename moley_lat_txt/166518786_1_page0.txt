THEY STICK
LIKE GLUE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In an article yesterday I
pointed out that, despite brave
claims of economy, this ad-
ministration has really failed
materially to cut back ex-
penses in the civil activities
of the government and in gov-
ernment employment.
And yet we are hearing
loud sounds of protests in
many quarters. The source
and nature of these com-
plaints serve to show how
difficult it is for the President
and his department heads to
cut in a manner which will
give the taxpayer real relief.
The net conclusion is that
something more than mere
good will by the administra-
tion will ultimately be neces-
sary to hack away the fat in
our vast Federal bureaucracy.

Most people will fight with
bitter desperation when their
jobs are threatened. And a
lot will fight with little atten-
tion to principle. Federal of-
fice-holders are no exception,
and they have advantages pe-
culiar to themselves.

After years of not too oner-
ous toil, with steadily in-
creasing pay and many
additional benefits, they are
deeply entrenched. In a
bureau or department there
is what might be po-
litely called “esprit de corps,”
which literally means that no
matter how fiercely they may
quarrel among themselves,
they will close ranks at the
approach of danger from
without. If one decides to
leave, he will be sure that the
plans are made to have a pal-
ly this is done so effectively
that the big boss will not
know of the prospective va-
cancy until it is filled.
Republican politicians in
Washington, anxious to re-
ward the faithful who partici-
pated in the 1952 campaign,
are already complaining bit-
terly about this practice.
Moreover, official holdovers
of any standing have learned
well during the years they
have served how to use
propaganda to their advan-
tage. They have intimates
among Washington corre-
spondents whom they have
helped with inside handouts
over the years. Hence, you
will see cropping up in the
papers, notably in some
signed comments, complaints
about how “morale” is being
destroyed by the “purge,” by
the “economy mania,” and
by the inevitable specter of
McCarthyism.

After a while the new peo-
ple who have come in since
January are convinced that
this or that activity is very
useful. I have a communica-
tion from an official of a de-
partment who complains that
a certain activity, which I
had said made no sense to
me, was a “vital unit.” An-
other was essential, he wrote,
because it informed the
American people about gov-
ernment and informed the
government about the people.
My feeling about that sort
of reply is that if everything
is kept that can show some
such justification, we may as
well give up trying to bal-
ance the budget or to reduce
taxes.
It is a curious thing how
short a time it takes a new
employee of the government
to forget about the essential
matter of taxes. I might an-
swer this official by saying
there are a lot of “vital”
things I would like to do with
my money which is taken
away by Uncle Sam’s tax
gatherers.

Out here in the West I have
heard repeated complaints,
even by businessmen who
ought to know better, to the
effect that curtailing of public
works will stifle the growth
of this State or that. A man
in Idaho said that a certain
very expensive irrigation proj-
ect was vitally necessary be-
cause we would have a na-
tional food shortage by 1971.
I replied that the taxpayer
was going to have a money
shortage long before that.
Local communities are still
being propagandized by hold-
over Federal agents in order
to start a backfire on Con-
gressmen. Politicians are
sowing the seeds for a crop
of anti-economy votes in 1954.
These are some of the prob-
lems facing those officials
who want to carry out the
1952 pledges of economy.
They are serious, and they
will prevail unless some sort
of bar is established to limit
Federal expenditures to Fed-
eral income, with taxes
lowered to a reasonable
level. The nature of such a
remedy I shall describe in
another article.
