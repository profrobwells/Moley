The Super-Salesman
of the GOP Committee
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
AKRON—People in this,
the home town of Ray Bliss,
Republican National Commit-
teeman for Ohio, will tell
you that he has succeeded in
politics because of three fac-
tors.
First, he is a trained busi-
ness salesman; second, he
likes people, joins many
things and makes people
like him; third, he is intelli-
gent and honest. I would add
another. He is unmarried
and so politics, that jealous
mistress, has no rival for
his attention.
Bliss was selected State
chairman in 1949, when the
Republican Party in Ohio
was in dire need of reorgan-
izing and revitalizing. It had
suffered disastrously in 1948.
It had been bumped badly
for State control by the popu-
lar Democratic Governor,
Frank Lausche. Bliss has giv-
en the party new life.
Bliss is a businessman. He
is head of the Tower Insur-
ance agencies in Akron. And
the success of this business-
man in politics prompts me
to offer an observation or
two about businessmen in
politics.
*
It is an old saw that busi-
nessmen are not good in poli-
tics. There is also the impli-
cation that businessmen are
not good for politics since
they are supposed to pursue
only the good of business and
to neglect the public interest.
This cliche neglects the
fact that there are at least
two kinds of businessmen—
executives and salesmen. The
executive gives orders, the
salesman gets orders. The ex-
ecutive can command. The
salesman must persuade. The
executive can afford to be
disliked. The salesman must
be liked. The executive sug-
gests autocracy. The sales-
man is indigenous to democ-
racy. He represents the free
market and liberal institu-
tions.
Defense Secretary Wilson
is the executive. Postmaster
General Summerfield is the
salesman.
In true salesmanship fash-
ion Bliss, when he became
State chairman, went to the
heart of his problem. Suc-
cess in selling is easier when
you find new customers
rather than when you try to
take customers away from
your competitor.
Bliss made a survey of the
disaster in 1948. He found
that 140,000 Republicans in
rural sections had failed to
vote at all in 1948. He found
the astonishing fact that at
least 150,000 potential Repub-
lican voters in industrial
sections had even failed to
register.
*
Here was his market. This
was fallow ground for politi-
cal energy.
He realized that many
people called themselves in-
dependents who were not
really independent but indif-
ferent. Hard work would
wake them up—hard work by
persistent workers.
For this sort of work Bliss
turned to three groups—
women, young voters and
veterans. He knew that get-
ting out the vote took per-
sistence at a rather hum-
drum task. Women are ad-
mirable in politics for that
reason. Despite the fact that
Bliss is a bachelor—indeed,
perhaps because he is a bach-
elor—he knew how persist-
ent women can be. Not in
years have the women of Ohio
been so awakened. He like-
wise organized young Repub-
licans and veterans.
His success has been as-
tounding. In 1946 Ohio cast
2,343,000 votes; in 1950, there
were 2,987,000 votes. In 1952
there were 3,701,000. In 1952
Eisenhower and Bricker
swept the State, despite the
re-election of Lausche.
True, the Republicans had
good men at the head of the
ticket—Sen. Taft in 1950,
Eisenhower in 1952. But Bliss
organized the victory.
