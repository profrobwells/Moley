An Analogy of Russia
From Gibbon's 'Rome'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Four months ago when the
news of Stalin's stroke ap-
peared, this commentator
found himself utterly con-
fused by the interpretations
of what were alleged sources
of inside information in Eu-
rope and Washington. In my
search for light I went to two
sources, a physician friend
and Gibbon's "Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire."
The conclusions I drew were
duly written for publication
and now, four months later,
I am far from ashamed of
them.
My physician friend told
me that when something less
than a mortal injury strikes
in the brain of a human be-
ing, the more immediate and
noticeable effects are in the
extremities. Gibbon told me
that after the death of the
great ruler, Augustus, the
Roman Empire virtually
ceased to grow. True, there
were efforts to put out into
the lands of the barbarians
by such emperors as Trajan.
But almost immediately such
gains were lost. The trend
for many, many years, espe-
cially under weak emperors
or when conflict occurred at
the capital, was the same-
the imperial domain shriv-
eled and died at the extremi-
ties.
Arguing from such analo-
gies as human anatomy and
history is always dangerous.
Their use in the interpreta-
tion of current events must
be like the use of powerful
drugs. They should be in
small doses and under the di-
rection of trained and experi-
enced advice. But when, as
in the present case, the ac-
tual "dope" from Europe is a
confused mass of rumor,
propaganda and lunacy, we
are safe in glancing at history
again.
So on my westward trip I
stopped at Walla Walla,
Wash., to talk history with
an old friend, Chester Maxey,
president of the fine, enlight-
ened institution, Whitman
College. We talked of trium-
virates, of Julius Caesar,
Crassus and Pompey, and of
Antony, Octavius and Lepi-
dus. Their creation was in
both cases the same, a truce
before the bitter deadly strug-
gle for power. Only a Caesar
survived from them but a
Caesar whose power was like
fame written in water.
Maxey and I both have
lived in New York close to
that once monolithic Demo-
cratic machine that ruled so
long. There were triumvi-
rates there and the boss who
survived one still lives.
After the abdication of
Richard Croker a triumvi-
rate ruled Tammany Hall.
Before long, Charles Murphy,
and only Charles Murphy,
held the scepter. Later Mur-
phy set up a triumvirate to
rule the machine in the
Bronx. The inevitable strug-
gle resulted and Ed Flynn
emerged alone and still runs
a somewhat dilapidated
organization.
The names and forms may
change but the malign way of
men in search of power re-
mains the same.
But while they struggle at
the central powerhouse of the
empire the lights grow dim
in the periphery. That ex-
plains the trouble in Hungary
Czechoslovakia, Poland and
East Germany that never will
be solved by appeasement
from Moscow. It probably
explains the decision of Mao
to resume negotiations in
Korea. We are witnessing the
beginning of the end. We
cannot bar the danger of war
and must stay strong. But
the giant is mortal and is
hurt.
