NEW YORK'S GOVERNMENT WITHIN GOVERNMENT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a dramatic appeal to the
people of New York against
the decision of Gov. Dewey
that he must resign as Sen-
ate leader and acting Lieu-
tenant Governor, Arthur H.
Wicks presented a theory of
public morals and public pol-
icy which deserves the most
serious attention of all Amer-
ican citizens and the politi-
cians who represent them in
government.
For if that theory, earnestly
presented by Wicks, is tak-
ing hold or has taken hold of
men vested with the power
of government, then we are
indeed on the perilous edge
of the line that separates the
system under which we have
lived in all past generations
and a system which can
bring either chaos or the
dictatorship of ruthless mi-
norities.
*
First, let Wicks state his
reasons why he made repeat-
ed visits to Sing Sing Prison
to confer with Joseph S. Fay,
convicted extortionist and
formerly vice-president of the
International Operating En-
gineers Union, AFL. He said.
"The dictionary says that
democratic government is
popularly determined author-
ity which directs and re-
strains the actions of men.
If that is so, there is more
than one government in our
State, that is, more than one
authority directing and re-
straining the actions of part
of our society at least.
*
"If you were a legislator in
Albany, you would not be
there long before you real-
ized that within and under
the democratic right of men
to organize, the laboring men
and labor interests have or-
ganized a government; that
under their own direction,
they have determined their
own leaders."
Wicks then went on to say
that his several visits to Fay
were in the interest of keep-
ing the construction of cer-
tain public works going on.
He was, in fact, pleading with
this "representative" of an-
other government. And to
clinch matters, he said this:
"And so I went to him. It
was lamentable, but was it
any more lamentable than it
is in our national foreign pol-
icy to seek peace and society's
welfare by audience with a
Premier Stalin, or a Marshal
Tito—meeting with them, not
because they are Commu-
nists, not in order to compro-
mise our truths with errors,
but meeting with them be-
cause they are, good or bad,
the accepted leaders of their
people who are making de-
mands on our society?"
Now let us examine this
frightening statement by a
man who is at this moment
only one heartbeat removed
from the Governorship of the
State of New York.
★
A labor organization, ac-
cording to this theory, is not
a mere group of private citi-
zens organized to deal with
other private citizens. It is a
sovereign government which
ranks with the sovereign gov-
ernment which represents us
all. The heads of labor are in
a position analogous to a Tito
and a Malenkov who, in fact,
whether we like it or not, are
the heads of states which in
international law are dealt
with as equals.
*
I am not stressing the point
that Fay is a convicted crimi-
nal whose crime should make
him an unfit and powerless
representative of his own
union. Presumably, under the
Wicks theory, the union can
ignore the fact that the law
of New York has not only put
this man in prison, but has
taken away his membership
in the civil community in the
sense that he has lost his
right to vote or hold office.
It should be added that the
importance of Fay seems to
have had the recognition of
people much more important
in government than Sen.
Wicks.
The whole thing will either
make Dewey an outstanding
figure in his generation or an-
other dream that could not
come true. That choice rests
with the Governor of New
York.
