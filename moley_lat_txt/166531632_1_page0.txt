IDAHO FALLS, Ida.—The
Army Engineers’ appropria-
tion bill for rivers, harbors,
flood control and electric pow-
er projects passed the Sen-
ate amid the loud protests of
the perennial proponents of
public power.
And well they may be
fearful of the future of the
Federal monopoly they have
been building so long. For
with the estimates submit-
ted by Budget Director
Dodge in behalf of the Presi-
dent, there was laid down an
entirely new policy for Fed-
eral public power. We can
imagine the perturbed spirit
of Harold Ickes looking on
with what must now for-
ever be dissent that is silent.
It is declared that wher-
ever private money and pri-
vate companies can properly
supply the need there shall
be no Federal competition.

This very closely follows
the declared policy of the
House Appropriations Com-
mittee. Moreover, since the
House Appropriations Com-
mittee in dealing with this
bill declared that it would
pass no items not recom-
mended by the Budget Bu-
reau, this policy must pre-
vail.
The statement of the
Budget Bureau was that the
administration proposed “to
proceed only with those
projects which are deemed
clearly essential in terms of
the objectives of this adminis-
tration.” That policy, as de-
clared by the President and
Secretary of the Interior
McKay, is to encourage by
reasonable means a greater
participation by the States
and by private enterprise in
developing power.
Coupled with this was an
order for the strictest econ-
omy in projects under way.
The Undersecretary of the
Army, Earl D. Johnson, or-
dered the Army Engineers
“to eliminate all new starts
and resumption of projects
and all new separate units of
projects previously started.”
Also, “to delay construction
up to one year on larger proj-
ects where this can be done
consistent with economical
prosecution of the work.”
The House and Senate
rigorously applied these rules
and, in fact, cut well below
the reduced estimates of the
President.

Both House and Senate
committees pointed to the
need for a new start in plan-
ning for the proper develop-
ment of water resources. The
House Appropriations Com-
mittee said that “it has been
obvious for some time that
there is vital need for a com-
prehensive program for the
development of water re-
sources of the nation.” It
continued by pointing to the
various reports inspired by
past Presidents and Congress-
es which are “apparently
merely gathering dust.”
This points to a failure
peculiar to both the Roose-
velt and Truman administra-
tions. They talked much of
planning but did little about
it. So far as water develop-
ment was concerned they
were so intent upon concen-
trating control over available
power sites by the Federal
government that there never
was adequate consideration of
the relative advantages of
high versus low dams, down-
stream dams and upstream
control, State versus Federal
works and public versus
private works.
It was war to the death
against private enterprise,
and the States take the hind-
most.
There now seems to be a
rational way to reach a solu-
tion of this great national
problem.
