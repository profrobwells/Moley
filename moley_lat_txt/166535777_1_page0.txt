Foundations Are Likely
to Be Studied Further
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The House Rules Commit-
tee has approved and given
the green light to a resolu-
tion introduced by Congress-
man Carroll Reece which pro-
vides for a study of tax-ex-
empt foundations and simi-
lar institutions. This will,
when passed by the House,
reconstitute and continue the
work of a committee headed
in the previous Congress by
the late Eugene Cox of Geor-
gia. Due to limitations of time
and the failing health of the
chairman, the Cox commit-
tee was able barely to scratch
the surface of a field that
needs deep and vigorous
plowing.
The Cox committee was
able, however, to settle a
number of points which clear-
ly establishes the legitimacy
of a Congressional study of
the nature and activities of
foundations. For they are, in
a very special way, responsi-
ble to the public and its gov-
ernment.
It was admitted over and
over by officials of founda-
tions in the inquiries of the
Cox investigation that since
their income is exempt from
taxation it is, in a large part,
money vested with a public
interest. For without tax ex-
emption it would share with
all other private income in
the support of government.
The Congress as well as the
Treasury has a right to see
if it is being spent for pur-
poses which are not only free
of a subversive taint but also
useful and wholesome.
This principle of public re-
sponsibility was well estab-
lished 40 years ago when the
first of the community foun-
dations was established in
Cleveland. The trust instru-
ment creating that founda-
tion specified that three of
the five members of the gov-
erning board should be ap-
pointed by public officials.
W. H. Goff, the truly great
and farsighted man who con-
ceived the idea of a commu-
nity trust and who was him-
self once a member of the
Rockefeller Foundation, stat-
ed that he could not agree
with the elder Rockefeller's
idea of a self-perpetuating
board.
Indeed, Rockefeller, 40
years ago when he was estab-
lishing the foundation that
bears his name, vainly sought
to have Congress incorporate
it. Strangely enough there
were sufficient voices raised
in Congress against such a
recognition that the offer was
rejected. Radicals of that
day regarded the idea as an
effort to incorporate conserv-
atism. At that time either
President Taft or his Attor-
ney General—I am not sure
which—made a slighting re-
mark about the motion of "in-
corporating Mr. Rockefeller."
Times certainly have
changed.
High taxes and the con-
viction among people of sub-
stance that great personal in-
heritances are not a particu-
larly good thing for chil-
dren have enormously in-
creased the number of tax-
exempt foundations. One ex-
pert witness before the Cox
committee last year put the
number between 30,000 and
35,000. He estimated the ag-
gregate assets of these at
$7,000,000,000, which means
an annual income available
for spending at a billion or
two. However, the wide va-
riety of such foundations al-
most precludes any specific
estimates.
Students of history may be
interested to know that
foundations are not new.
They seem to have started in
ancient Egypt and Chaldea.
In 65 BC, Cicero initiated the
first known public investiga-
tion of foundations and, due
to his efforts, many were dis-
solved because of some re-
lationship to the conspiracy
of Catiline. So Congressman
Reece will not be entirely a
pioneer. Nor will he be un-
able to cite precedent.
Great good can come from
a penetrating and construc-
tive study of foundations by
the Reece committee when
and if established. It need
not concentrate upon the ex-
tent to which some founda-
tions have supported sub-
versive activities, although
there have been definite in-
stances of that sort.
Foundations properly man-
aged can do many things that
are vitally important, such
as the magnificent contribu-
tions of the Rockefeller
Foundation to health and
medicine. They are, on the
other hand, often plagued by
lazy and merely ornamental
boards of control and bureau-
cratic staffs. The risk of
wasteful and undesirable ac-
tivities increases as they pene-
trate into the so-called "so-
cial sciences." There is need
for some wholesome correc-
tives in their work in that
field, either by their own ef-
forts or by the strong push of
a Congressional committee.
