FINANCIAL
DESPAIR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Back here in New York, the
sentiment rising from the re-
cently baked pavements of
Wall Street is that, with the
termination of the excess
profits tax and the cut in indi-
vidual income rates on Jan. 1,
it will be impossible to bring
the budget into balance and
that further deficits and infla-
tion are inevitable.
There is a growing convic-
tion in what is known as the
investment field that even a
Republican administration
will fail to save the dollar
from further deterioration.
This, it would seem, would
mean higher prices next year
and a rising stock market.
That is, one might draw that
logical conclusion.

*

But Wall Street is not
strong on logical conclusions;
and, so far, the selling has
outstripped the buying.
However, the melancholy
conclusion that the tide of
spending cannot appreciably
be stemmed can be enter-
tained, if in moments of
weariness and depression we
listen too long to the shrill
voices of selfish interest
abroad in the land. Those
voices found a perfect repre-
sentative in the Harry S. Tru-
man who held forth in De-
troit on Labor Day. It was
the same old appeal to the
stomachs and pocketbooks of
the many specific interests-
farmers, wage-earners, re-
gional interests hitherto bene-
fited by Federal funds, and
all of the pressure groups
that can be arrayed against
the joint concern of the na-
tion.
Perhaps it can be said that
philosophically the Truman
doctrine is to array the sev-
eral against the joint. The
many interest groups against
the total body of the nation's
taxpayers. As the latter are
vastly more numerous and
have the best logical case,
they almost always lose in
the struggle with the former.

If President Eisenhower
could become the spokesman
for those taxpayers, who in
truth can be called "the
many," against the rapacity
of "the few" in the interest
groups, he might prevail in
this battle for solvency and
perhaps assure himself a sin-
gular place in history. But he
will have to be single-minded
about it and stop trying to
buy off the opposition to econ-
omy, one by one.
Take for example the or-
ganized veterans' groups, not
to be confused with the total-
ity of all veterans. One point
where a lot of money can be
saved is in limiting free med-
ical care to veterans who can-
not afford to pay. That group
of the needy is really not
large. But recently the Amer-
ican Legion in St. Louis and
the U.S. Spanish War Vet-
erans in Cleveland spoke out
against the relatively modest
cuts already made. The Le-
gion a year ago seemed to be
against socialized medicine
for everybody but veterans.
Then there are the farmers
who bitterly mourn the fall
in meat prices. And the pub-
lic power people in the North-
west who bewail the policy
of easing the spending on
dams and transmission lines.
And those who want deserts
to bloom with Federal irriga-
tion subsidies—subsidies, I
should add, that are getting
higher by the year. There
are the Chambers of Com-
merce, bitterly regretting the
loss of unnecessary defense
establishments. Then there
are the embattled and en-
trenched bureaucrats—for-
mer employees of the lavish-
ly benign Truman dispensa-
tion, talking about cuts in
"services" at home and
abroad.
Vastly more important than
anything else that the Presi-
dent faces in the domestic
field is this need to mobilize
support from the all against
the many, or, if you would
borrow a Truman phrase but
not a Truman meaning, "the
many" against "the few."
