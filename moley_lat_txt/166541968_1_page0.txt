When I saw Mayor Vincent
Impellitteri the other day,
after his name had been ruled
off the New York City ballot,
I felt sorry for him. This
was not so much because he
was to leave John MacComb's
masterpiece of early 19th cen-
tury architecture, but because
chance and mistaken am-
bition had ever assigned a de-
cent chap to such a job.
He was catapulted into the
Mayor's chair three years ago
because of an unseemly deal
which whisked William
O'Dwyer to the Ambassador-
ship of Mexico just in time
for him to escape serious em-
barrassment. Once in office,
Impellitteri gave battle to
Tammany and stayed on. But
'n the end Tammany and the
Bronx machine bested him in
the primary this year with a
notable name, Robert F. Wag-
ner Jr., which happens to
have been bequeathed to an
inconsequential son.
If history has anything to
teach, that is the end of the
political career of Vincent
Impellitteri.
When I began the research
essential to the writing of
th's piece. I was laboring un-
cier a faulty impression. I
believed that only once in a
century had a person risen
from the Mayoralty of New
York to a higher political
office. That exception was a
tool of Boss Tweed named
Jchn T. Hoffman, who be-
came Governor but who fell
in the ruins when his mas-
ter was overthrown.
To my surprise, I found
that one Fernando Wood,
after two malodorous terms
as Mayor, served for some
time in the House of Repre-
sentatives. In my range of
values, that was a promo-
tion.
With those two exceptions,
17 Mayors went nowhere in
politics. from a person named
Westervelt in 1853 to Seth
Low in 1902. Most of them
were nobodies in their own
right, two or three were ras-
cals, and two-.Abram Hewitt
and W. R. Grace had dis-
tinction in the business
world.
There is the record and, de-
spite it, three deluded men
are inviting tragedy and ob-
livion this year. A fourth
is running, but he doesn't ex-
pect to win. He is merely
advertising the Red under-
wear of the American Labor
Party.
The moral of all this is that
the job requires an all but
nonexistent combination of
personal characteristics. La
Guardia succeeded because
he was at once a demagogue
and a tireless and able execu-
tive. This year we have a
demagogue and a good execu-
tive running, but they hap-
pen to be two people.
The basic fault is that New
York is not one city. It is
many cities. It was created
by a merger in the very pe-
riod. a half century ago, when
mergers and expansions were
the rage in business, too.
There is a hint of federalism
in its government, but not
enough decentralization. The
creators of Greater New York
brought into being a job in
which only one man in a
century could make good.
