DEWEY'S
DILEMMA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Unless Thomas E. Dewey
is consumed with an un-
quenchable ambition to try
for the Presidency again, he
must at this moment wish
that he and not Warren had
ascended to the political
sanctuary of the Supreme
Court. For there have de-
scended upon him problems
and dilemmas more serious
than he has ever before con-
fronted in his long career in
New York politics.
The Dewey appeal in New
York, and it has been a pow-
erful influence, has been un-
compromising warfare on all
forms of organized crime and
racketeering. It has also been
an appeal to all who believe
Tammany to be sinful and
exclusively sinful. The sug-
gestion that Republicans, es-
pecially Dewey Republicans,
are involved in friendly re-
lations with shady labor lead-
ers and other rascals has
made little headway with the
voters in New York.
Imagine, therefore, Dew-
ey's embarrassment to find,
after all his Herculean labors,
in the stables of crime and
labor politics, that those
grimy precincts have been oc-
casionally frequented by peo-
ple of his own party and his
own choosing. Three scan-
dals, each involving labor
leaders, have brought these
associations to view and the
Governor is at the moment
faced with the alternative of
swinging away at friends and
foes alike or risking the
charge that there is one
standard for Republicans and
another for Democrats.
The most recent of these
embarrassments concerns one
Joseph Fay, who as vice-pres-
ident of an AFL union bossed
the building trades in New
York and New Jersey. He
was convicted eight years ago
and, it was thought, safely
deposited under the Gover-
nor's jurisdiction in Sing
Sing. But Fay proved that
even in Dewey's New York,
"stone walls do not a prison
make"â€”not while humane
prison management fixes vis-
iting hours. The Fay seat on
the Hudson became a mecca
for politicians from both
States and from both parties.
Among the very frequent
visitors were William S.
Bleakley, the most powerful
Republican leader in West-
chester County; John Kenny,
the Democratic Mayor of Jer-
sey City; George Meany, pres-
ident of the AFL; the pres-
idents of the AFL of both
States; Paul Troast, now Re-
publican candidate for Gov-
ernor of New Jersey, and, to
the great embarrassment of
the State administration, Ar-
thur H. Wicks, president of
the New York Senate and, as
acting Lieutenant Governor,
the Dewey heir-apparent.
What all these people
talked about with Fay cannot
be recited here because all
that we know is what red-
faced politicians say, and
that sounds for the most part
fishy.
An equally great embar-
rassment is the revelation
that the immensely profitable
harness race tracks of New
York have been the seats of
vast extortions by labor rack-
eteers and that Dewey's clos-
est political lieutenant, na-
tional committeeman and pre-
sumably Federal patronage
dispenser, Russell Sprague,
owned some 4000 shares of
the Yonkers race track. The
conditions regarding the ac-
quisition of that stock and
the amount of emoluments de-
rived therefrom would belie
the idea that it was a par-
ticularly risky investment. In
fact, like that classic figure,
Plunkitt of Tammany Hall,
Sprague "seen his opportuni-
ties and took 'em."
Joseph Ryan of the long-
shoremen, whose union re-
cently became too odorous
for the AFL, appears to have
been a great favorite of poli-
ticians of all New York par-
ties. At great annual dinners
for him the more or less no-
ble and the worldlywise as-
sembled to do honor and ora-
torical tribute. The 1952 chair-
man of the dinner was the
present Democratic candidate
for Mayor of New York, Rob-
ert Wagner Jr. Among the
guests were a goodly number
of Republican politicians high
in the Dewey "team."
"Perhaps," said my assist-
ant and secretary when she
got to this point in copying
this piece, "that is why this
campaign for Mayor is so
clean. All sides are living in
glass houses."
