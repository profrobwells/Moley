DEMOCRATS WILL MAKE
THE ISSUES OF 1954
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is something re-
freshingly new in the ap-
proach of President Eisen-
hower to tough political
problems. The most recent
example of that is the pro-
gram of generalities that
came out after the recent
White House conference of
Republican leaders.
It is clear that the Presi-
dent and his immediate offi-
cial White House family feel
that it will be very effective
to have a nice list of laws
passed by the forthcoming
session of Congress and to go
forth next autumn and tell
the people all about them.
*
This is a fine thought to
have around this holiday sea-
son but, like some Christmas
neckties, these hopes will be
limp and faded by Easter.
And then, come Labor Day,
it will be the fierce attacks of
the opposition that will make
the issues.
The best thing that seemed
to come from the White
House parleys was the mani-
fest goodwill in which the
conferences were held. In
that the President is a mas-
ter, however much he may
have to learn about the hard
ways of politics.
He will need all of that
fund of goodwill as things
unfold in the months to come.
For on questions like the
amendment of the Taft-Hart-
ley Act, farm supports, tariff
reductions and foreign aid
the differences between the
President's advisers and the
preponderant Republican
group in Congress are wide
and deep.
*
There is still a resentment
that approaches bitterness
about the utter failure of the
administration to make any
considerable progress in rid-
ding itself of personnel in
the departments who find it
easy and convenient to frus-
trate efforts to carry out
campaign promises. This re-
sentment is not entirely be-
cause so few jobs have been
provided for Republicans but
it is also because the admin-
istration, except for a few
top people, is much the same
as it was when Candidate Ei-
senhower in 1952 promised to
clean it out.
*
The attacks of Senators
like Morse, Kefauver and
Humphrey will grow in in-
tensity and we can have a
fairly good idea now of what
they will be. The old specter
of Big Business will be prom-
inent. In many States New
Dealers will be campaigning
vigorously on the issue of
electric power. They will say
that the administration has
"sold out" to the "interests."
Morse will be even more
the incorrigible nuisance
than he was in the last ses-
sion. He claims that he has
traveled more and made more
speeches than any other Sen-
ator in the recess. Those
speeches were made to local
audiences and fortunately
have not encumbered the
Congressional Recordâ€”as yet.
*
He says that he intends to
oppose practically every-
thing, particularly any effort
to remove people not under
Civil Service. The theme of
his story will be that the
country is unhappy over Re-
publican rule and is waiting
for the first chance to change
it all.
Kefauver is running not
only for re-election to the
Senate but undoubtedly for
the Presidency in 1956. His
attacks upon Republican pol-
icies will, except in the South,
be much more vigorous than
the mild banter of Stevenson.
Faced by such opposition,
Republican candidates will
build their own arguments.
They are not going to cam-
paign as the White House
dictates. They will fire with
whatever ammunition they
find to be most effective.
