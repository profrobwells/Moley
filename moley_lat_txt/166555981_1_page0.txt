A DUEL OF
PROFESSORS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I have received a letter
from a professor in a large
American university taking
me to task for my views fa-
voring the Bricker amend-
ment.
Since the gentleman is a
perfect stranger to me, and
since the letter and an article
accompanying it are obvious-
ly propaganda efforts to in-
fluence my opinion on a pub-
lic question, I do not regard
what he says as a private or
privileged communication, al-
though I shall withhold his
name and that of the institu-
tion in which he is a profes-
sor.
*
In fact, the propaganda
purpose of the communica-
tion is so stated. It says that
he hopes his pamphlet will
lead me "to take a somewhat
different attitude."
His first sentence is this:
"It is natural that some col-
umnists who are mere jour-
nalists should be misled by
the ardent supporters of the
Bricker amendment, but I
greatly regret that a former
Columbia professor should be
infected by their terror of
treaties."
I shall not argue the Brick-
er amendment in this piece,
although my views stand un-
impaired after this attack.
Nor shall I stress the patron-
izing tone of the communica-
tion except to say that this
attitude of some professors
may explain why their insti-
tutions are having so much
trouble these days.
*
I have had enough experi-
ence to know how that atti-
tude grows with the seclusion
in which a long academic life
is more or less enjoyed. In-
cidentally, I am not a "for-
mer" professor yet.
In the sentence I have
quoted, the word "natural"
appears. Another professor
in this man's institution used
to warn students against the
loose use of the word "nat-
ural." In this case it is used
to glide easily over a hard
point of evidence.
There is nothing "natural"
in the sense of an innate or
habitual disposition of jour-
nalists to lose their balance
in the presence of "ardent
supporters" of this or that. I
have found that the more ar-
dent a person is, the more a
good reporter will suspect
the validity of his case.
*
There are good lawyers and
plausible arguments on both
sides of the Bricker matter.
The real reason why I fa-
vor it is based not on any-
thing I learned as a profes-
sor, beyond the plain mean-
ing of the law before and
after the Holland vs. Mis-
souri case. I favor it because
in my contacts with the ac-
tual people who conduct for-
eign relations — as distin-
guished from the dream peo-
ple used in much academic
discussion—I have learned
how fallible they are and, in
particular, how ardently the
members of the executive de-
partment will try to rid them-
selves of Congressional re-
straints.
I have also learned how
shocking have been the be-
trayals of the national in-
terest by members of the For-
eign Service in past years. I
learned this by the hard way
of 20 years in journalism. I
might also add, I hope with-
out returning patronage in
kind, that, unlike this profes-
sor, I served in the State De-
partment for a period and
know the actualities there.
"Mere" journalists are in
contact with government.
Their knowledge of its na-
ture is more likely to be re-
liable because of that fact.
Finally, I would remind my
corresponding that, after hav-
ing learned my trade in the
two professions of teaching
and journalism, I found the
latter much more exacting.
This professor might not be
so contemptuous of "mere
journalists" if he tried for a
while to interest a million or
more people several times a
week and at the same time to
be accurate and libelproof.
