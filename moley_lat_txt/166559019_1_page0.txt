'OUTS' ARE
STILL IN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems that a Federal
court decision has been re-
quired to overturn a decision
by the Federal Civil Service
Commission sustaining the
protest of a Justice Depart-
ment lawyer who was ousted
by the Attorney General.
The Civil Service Commis-
sion is headed by a man,
Philip Young, who was ap-
pointed by President Eisen-
hower but who seems to have
dedicated himself to the task
of keeping as many Demo-
crats in office as possible.
There is grim irony in this
situation, especially since
Young himself is apparently a
Democrat. His appointment is
perhaps an example of what
the President means by a
government of all the people.
This case, however, will
open the way to the replace-
ment of at least one class of
government employee. For
only those lawyers in the
government who were ap-
pointed before 1941 had or
have real Civil Service status.
And those are very few in-
deed.
A labor expert in private
employment who recently
had some business with the
NLRB remarked that he was
astonished to find from top to
bottom the same lawyers
there who were there a year
ago.
In one vast department em-
ploying tens of thousands,
only 40 Eisenhower people
can be found.
I have before me a letter
which itself is a grim remind-
er of the situation which con-
fronts the top people in this
administration. It is from a
friend who was appointed un-
der the new administration
and it is typed laboriously by
the man himself. He says
that, considering the contents,
he could not trust his secre-
tary, who is a holdover Demo-
crat. She regards her boss and
others of his status as more
or less temporary interlopers.
The situation is so bad that
it can be said with no little
truth that instead of Eisen-
hower's taking over the bu-
reaucracy, the bureaucracy
has taken over him.
The situation should be in-
tolerable. But apparently the
President's toleration is un-
limited.
Perhaps he is listening so
intently to those so-called in-
dependents who are urging
him vigorously to crack down
on his own party that he has
forgotten that he was elected
because of his promise to
crack down upon the accumu-
lation of bureaucracy, of
which we heard so much in
the campaign.
There are three reasons
why this holdover situation
should be intolerable.
First, the whole Civil Serv-
ice system under which hold-
overs are allegedly protected
is so antiquated and irrational
that it is doing exactly what
Civil Service was designed to
eliminate. That was abundant-
ly proved in the task force re-
port of the first Hoover Com-
mission. One of the prize ex-
amples presented in its report
was that of a fearfully incom-
petent stenographer. It took
17 months to fire her.
Second, there is something
in the claim of those who la-
bored to elect the ticket in
1952 that room should be
made for some of them in
government.
A third and exceedingly se-
rious reason is that these
holdovers for the most part
are indeed making policy. It
is they on whom department
heads are at this moment de-
pending for the labor of mak-
ing up their reports and rec-
ommendations for the Presi-
dent and Congress. It is they
who are preparing the budg-
ets for the departments.
These matters are not just
clerical. They are in essence
policy-making.
It is still time for a change.
