President Eisenhower's
plan for the control and use
of atomic energy suggests
one field where an interna-
tional agreement can be of
greatest value. For this prop-
erty, this source of energy, is
too dangerous to civilization
to be entrusted to any au-
thority except the govern-
ment. Perhaps ultimately pri-
vate enterprise can share the
responsibility, but for the
time being here is a spot
where nationalization can be
justified.

Such dependence upon in-
ternational agreements in
most other fields, however,
presents a real and present
danger to economic liberty.
That danger lies in the effort
of collectivists in the govern-
ment, notably in the Depart-
ment of State, to manipulate
international agreements and
treaties in a manner which
will collectivize our economy.
The patterns of revolution,
like the shape of the clouds,
are subject to rapid but al-
most imperceptible change.
Twenty years ago those mem-
bers of Roosevelt's so-called
brain trust who were the
more extreme advocates of
concentrating power in the
government were strong na-
tionalists.
Rex Tugwell, for example,
used to say that most of the
younger, "forward-looking"
economists believed in intra
rather than inter nationalism.
The Socialization of the econo-
my could more easily be ac-
complished by keeping the
gates closed against the in-
fluences of international trade
and finance.
For a wholly different rea-
son I held to a belief in a
rather strict nationalism.
Those were the days when
Wall Street, dominated by in-
ternational banking, regarded
both Tugwell and me as dan-
gerous influences, and free
traders like Secretary Hull
considered our views in terms
unmentionable in polite so-
ciety.

The great surge toward in-
ternationalism which accom-
panied our participation in
the second world war and the
confusion attending the pro-
liferation of agencies operat-
ing in the foreign field gave
all ranges of the left wing,
from moderately Socialistic
people to actual members of
the Communist conspiracy,
exactly what they needed.
For under the guise of fine-
sounding international agree-
ments they were able to add
one after another restriction
on our free economy.
Some of the influential
people in government during
those years, like Alger Hiss
and Harry Dexter White,
were masters at this tech-
nique.

At the present moment
some of the top policy peo-
ple in the government who
have been brought in by
President Eisenhower are
awakening to this danger.
Others are still unable to
comprehend it. There is, in
fact, a conflict of the moment
over an international tin
agreement. Other such agree-
ments will follow if that one
is adopted.
The controversy over the
Bricker amendment has
brought out the fact that the
power to make treaties and
international agreements
opens great holes in the Con-
stitution. That amendment
arose largely because the
fears of many lawyers were
awakened by the U.N. Cove-
nant on Human Rights. But
that is only one of the pro-
posed agreements which are
susceptible to the devices of
resolutionists.

In his testimony before the
Jenner committee last June
J. Anthony Panuch, who in
1945 served as co-ordinator in
the State Department of the
many agencies dumped there
after the war, clearly pointed
out the danger. He said
among other things:
The historic change initi-
ated by our entry into the
United Nations was to place
"a large part of our foreign
policy on an international
basis rather than on the tra-
ditional country-to-country or
bilateral basis."
The extent to which this
shift in the pattern of our
foreign policy can move into
the domestic field is truly
alarming. We may ultimately
be ruled not by the well-
known strictures of the Con-
stitution but by the fine
print in a multitude of in-
ternational agreements.
