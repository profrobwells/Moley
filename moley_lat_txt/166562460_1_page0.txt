NEWSPAPER
PAINS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is becoming quite evi-
dent that in one respect at
least the Eisenhower admin-
istration is following prec-
edent. It is working up a
peeve against the press.
The signs of this are re-
ported by newspapermen
who are in daily contact with
the departments in Washing-
ton. It was especially no-
ticeable in the words and at-
titude of Harold Stassen
when he faced the inexorable
"Meet the Press" panel on
Dec. 27.
More than once he asserted
that the press had misinter-
preted his own and Secretary
Dulles' position on foreign re-
lations. In particular he as-
serted that the press has
given the impression that Mr.
Dulles' speech before the
North Atlantic Council was a
threat to the French govern-
ment to get in line with the
European Defense Communi-
ty or go without help from us.
*
So far as I have seen ac-
counts of that speech in a
number of newspapers, it was
accurately reported. The sali-
ent sentences were: "If, how-
ever, the European Defense
Community should not be-
come effective; if France and
Germany remain apart, so
that they would again be po-
tential enemies, then indeed
there would be grave doubt
whether continental Europe
could be made a place of safe-
ty. That would compel an
agonizing reappraisal of basic
United States policy."
If there was any other way
to report such diplomatic lan-
guage Mr. Stassen did not
state it. He contented him-
self with quarreling with a
generality, "The press," with-
out specifying how the mis-
representation had been
made.
It is true that Stassen has
always been a very serious
man. His smiles seem to be
born in painful labor; his
humor is sterile. But in the
particular appearance to
which I refer he seemed un-
usually grim and touchy.
Clearly he was using the ap-
pearance not to answer ques-
tions but to get a message
over to the country. And a
sizable part of that message
was that "the press" was not
giving him or the Secretary
of State or the President a
square break.
*
There are bound to be oc-
casional flare-ups among
members of the Washington
corps of correspondents, such
as the complaint about the
breaking of the news of the
Warren appointment by the
Attorney General to a fa-
vored few reporters. But
there is no occasion for gen-
eralized charges of press mis-
representation.
Indeed, the President has
had what seems to me a very
good press, and he seems to
appreciate it.
However, this situation pre-
sents nothing new. F.D.R.'s
bitterness toward most pub-
lishers is well remembered.
He mixed his denunciations
of publishers with a friendly
attitude toward their cor-
respondents. His attitude
was: "You are fine boys. It's
too bad you have to work for
such people."
The result was an exceed-
ingly good press which, after
all, was a tribute to the pub-
lishers' sense of fairness.
But it requires little
thought to realize that in the
long period of one-party gov-
ernment it was the press that
supplied the real opposition.
And that opposition now and
always will be the best de-
fense against bad govern-
ment.
