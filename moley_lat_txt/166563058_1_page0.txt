Whoever among the friends
and advisers of the President
approves and compliments
him on what he said in his
press conference on the day
after the New York and New
Jersey elections will be doing
him a tragic disservice. For
if the state of mind that is revealed
there is to be projected
into the next year, the results
a year from now will indeed
be catastrophic for him and
his party.
It is well for him to claim
a limited ignorance of local
situations. No human being
could learn all the local problems
that affect elections and
at the same time carry the
burden of the Presidency.
But there were big situations
that affected the results in
New York and New Jersey,
and the head of his party cannot
afford to ignore them.

What has been happening
there has been the exposure,
first by the Kefauver committee,
and later by the New
York State Crime Commission,
of the existence of a
black cloud of labor racketeering
and corrupt connections
between crime and politics.
The center of this is the
Port of New York, and it has
spread to the west into New
Jersey, north into Westchester,
and beyond and east into
Long Island. It involves various
businesses where lavish
money is involved, such as
shipping, race tracks, building,
etc.
Tammany, as always, is
in the picture but years and
years of such associations
have made that an old story.
What has really shocked
people is the fact that this
could have reached high Republican
officialdom. The
Fay case is an example. The
Donis case reached even into
the Trenton Statehouse.
*
The acting Lieutenant Governor
of New York has been
told to resign by Gov.
Dewey but the people who
held race track stock while
they were charged by law
with policing race tracks
have received no public rebuke
from the Governor.
All of this fell like a tidal
wave of cold water on the
campaigns in New York City
and New Jersey. Many, many
thousands, disgusted with
both parties, simply stayed
at home in New York City
and in the 6th Congressional
District of New Jersey.
The President knew
enough about New York
City, which after all is his
voting place, to endorse
Riegelman, the really able
and clean Republican candidate
for Mayor. But Riegel-
man and everybody else running
on the Republican
ticket could hardly meet the
shock of what had happened
to the party in the State. I
imagine that is what happened
in New Jersey, too.
*
It is not encouraging to
the President’s loyal supporters
over the country and
in Congress for him to refer
to himself as a novice in
politics. It is, of course, always
refreshing to find humility
in a public man, especially
in a President, but
the comment about a “novice”
was attached to a statement
that he never claimed
to be a politician. He should
be reminded that a lot of
politicians are fine people
and that thousands of them
fought hard for him.
There is nothing bad about
being a politician. In fact,
from the moment he agreed
to run, the President has
been a politician. It also
ought to be added that he
has been in the business long
enough to move out of the
novitiate.
*
The most disturbing statement
of all was that Eisenhower
felt that the Republican
Party could succeed only
if it won over a lot of Democrats
and “Independents.” If
this means that his course of
action and his program must
resemble the course and program
of the administration
that preceded him, he will
awake to a saddened dawn.
For the people who really
elected him were not Democrats.
The Democrats voted
for Stevenson. The Eisenhower
majority came from
people who refused to vote at
all in 1948 because they felt
that Dewey and Warren offered
nothing better than
Truman. Those people will
stay at home again unless
they are offered something
more than this administration
has shown in its 10
months in office.
