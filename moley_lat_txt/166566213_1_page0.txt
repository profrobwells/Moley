RELIGION
DECISION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Supreme Court of New
Jersey, by unanimous deci-
sion, reminds us once more
of a truth that might grow
dim by the passing of the
years.
This recent decision says
that religion and religious
worship must remain free
not only of all those more
common enemies which are
the product of hate and fear,
but of the seductive but deadly
power of state support.
For no tyranny can be more
overpowering than govern-
ment in the garb of a nurse-
maid.
*
The facts in the case
brought before the court
seem to be wholly without
danger. In fact, they are be-
guiling, except to those who
can see the basic principle
involved.
The Gideons International
is an organization whose purpose
is to bring the Bible to
as many people as possible.
Every American who fre-
quents hotels has had some
reason to be indebted to the
Gideon Bible he almost al-
ways finds in his room.
Recently the Gideons have
undertaken a campaign to
get the Bible into the hands
of school children through
co-operation with the proper
authorities.
A local division of the
Gideon organization proposed
to the Board of Education of
Rutherford, N.J., that it offer
to the children in the schools
of that city copies of a vol-
ume containing the Psalms,
the Proverbs and the New
Testament. At a meeting of
the board later opposition to
the idea was voiced by a
Catholic priest and a Jewish
rabbi on the ground that the
volume in question was de-
rived from the King James
version of the Bible, which
is unacceptable to the Roman
Catholic and Jewish reli-
gions.
Despite these objections
the board proceeded to ar-
range for a distribution of
the volumes. The method
was to address a letter to the
parents requesting each to in-
dicate whether he wanted the
child to have one of the
books. Then the children of
those who so indicated were
to receive their books in
their schoolrooms.
Action was taken in the
courts and the board was re-
strained from carrying out
its plan. The case reached
the New Jersey Supreme
Court and Chief Justice Ar-
thur T. Vanderbilt has hand-
ed down the decision of the
court.
It should be noted here
that Justice Vanderbilt la-
bored for many years in the
interest of judicial reform in
New Jersey and the recently
adopted Constitution of that
State contains much of the
reform which he advocated.
His name, it will be remem-
bered, was under considera-
tion for appointment as Chief
Justice of the United States.
It was, in fact, one of the
final three before the Presi-
dent, and the decision for
Warren was apparently made
because of a slight difference
in age.
*
This decision reviews in
detail the age-old struggle be-
tween church and state and
concludes that the proposed
action of the Rutherford
Board of Education would in
fact violate the principle of
the separation of church and
state as set forth in the Fed-
eral Bill of Rights and in the
Constitution of New Jersey.
This wholesome reaffirma-
tion of a great principle
might well be a warning to
all religious bodies that their
integrity must depend upon
their ability to stand alone.
Even so slight an impair-
ment as was proposed by the
Rutherford board involves
that principle.
Religion's eternal values
must rest not in union with
the state but in separation.
