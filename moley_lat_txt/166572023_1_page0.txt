The Congress Should
Get Credit for Thrift
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
One of the best of the busi-
ness letters coming out of
Washington tells its subscrib-
ers in substance that those
who want economy should
restrain whatever hopes they
may have until long after
they hear the Eisenhower
budget.
The letter points out that,
while the President's budget
may show substantial reduc-
tions, it is only a request
and that Congress has a
habit of increasing appropri-
ations above such requests.
*
But so far as a past trend
in the present Congress is
concerned, the statement is
simply not true. Perhaps the
writer of the letter means
that he guesses that in a
session in an election year
Congress will be more lavish
than the President. If that
were his meaning, he should
have stated that qualification,
but he did not.
In the first session of this
Congress, which ended in
midsummer, Congress, not
the President, was the thrifty
member of the Republican
"team." Here are the official
figures in round numbers.
Truman's budget, asked for
$64,115,000,000. Eisenhower's
revised budget reduced that
to $54,508,000,000. The House
approved $50,581,000,000. The
Senate raised that to $51,446,-
000,000. The final House-Sen-
ate compromise was $51,072,-
000,000. And so Congress was
$3,436,000,000 more thrifty
than the President.
If you want the amount
that the taxpayer must shoulder,
add to each of these figures
$7,416,000,000 in permanent
appropriations which
are more or less mandatory.
The only major appropria-
tion bill in which the House
of Representatives did not
cut the President's requests
was in agriculture. In that
bill the House added $4,000,-
000.
In the President's address
to the nation over television
and radio his advisers provided
him with some tricky
language which may or may
not have been designed to
convey the impression that
the administration cut the
requests of the Truman ad-
ministration by $13,000,000,-
000. He said:
"Now; so much for our be-
liefs and the aims and pur-
poses of this administration;
What has been accomplished
in the year just past?"
Then there follows a list
of things, in which the following
appears:
"Requests for new appro-
priations have been reduced
by $13,000,000,000."
Candor and fairness to Con-
gress should have dictated a
mention of all the facts at
this point. But the entire
speech, while it hailed at one
place the establishment of a
"proper working relationship
between the executive and
legislative branches of the
Federal government," practically
ignored Congress.
The President's advisers
and speech writers would
have won for him much credit
if they had inserted in the
speech some slight boost for
Congress itself. But it is be-
coming more and more ap-
parent that those advisers
and speech writers who with
much fanfare traveled down
to the golf course to "work"
on this speech are entirely
in sympathy with those who
are constantly belittling Con-
gress and demanding that the
President "crack down" on
that body. One would think
that the President and not
Congress will be on trial be-
fore the voters this year.

There is little doubt about
the sincerity of the Presi-
dent in recognizing the co-
ordinate place of Congress
in our system of government.
But there is also little doubt
that these small men around
him are not, to use one of
their own words, "imple-
menting" that trait in their
boss.
It is reported that C. D.
Jackson, one of those advisers,
is so busy working on
the President's speeches that
another White House adviser
is working on Jackson's
speeches. Maybe the Presi-
dent should let Jackson write
his own speeches for a
change.
