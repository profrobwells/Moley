HOW WE GET GLOBAL CONTROLS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Over and over in the last
few years internationalists in
the State Department, in
happy collaboration with like-
minded officials in foreign
governments and in the
United Nations, have forward-
ed a movement to create in-
ternational commodity agree-
ments.
Such agreements, reduced
to their bare essentials, mean
controls thrust into our do-
mestic economy and immense
outlays by our government
for the building up of what
are called "buffer stocks" of
raw materials. One need only
examine such documents as
the Havana Charter, the so-
called "green book" of the
Mutual Security Agency, the
record of the international
materials conference, and the
more recent Paley report to
see the pattern of economic
internationalism.
The $600,000,000 wheat
agreement, now condemned
by the Randall commission,
is an example of the perfected
work of such a project.
The story of an attempt to
engineer a similar rubber
agreement is an example of
an effort that so far has
failed.
For three years there have
been conferences at an inter-
national level concerning the
creation of an international
rubber cartel-a buffer stock
scheme-designed to raise the
price of crude rubber.
Representatives of the
great producing and consum-
ing countries in this case
the British, U.S., and Nether-
lands governments-set up
an international rubber study
group to discuss rubber prob-
lems and to keep the world
rubber situation under con-
tinuous review. Annual meet-
ings were held. In May, 1953,
the management committee
gathered in Copenhagen for
the purpose of "securing ac-
cord on the outstanding
points in the draft buffer
stock agreement." Most re-
cently, the committee met in
London, in October, and its
findings and a draft agree-
ment were forwarded to
member governments.
The buffer stock idea
would be self-defeating.
Trends in Indonesia and
Malaya have already demon-
strated how even anticipa-
tion by these countries of
U.S. participation in such a
plan increases production.
There is little doubt that
such a plan, by raising the
price of crude rubber, would
further stimulate both crude
rubber and synthetic rubber
production. This would re-
quire additions of ever-grow-
ing surpluses to the buffer
stock until the United States
would be groaning under a
monumental burden. The cost
to the American taxpayer
might dwarf even the inter-
national wheat agreement.
In May, 1953, the rubber
study group thought that nat-
ural rubber would enter 1954
under the weight of a surplus
of nearly 200,000 tons. Present
estimates are more encourag-
ing, however. World produc-
tion fell off slightly while
consumption rose and Ameri-
can strategic purchases con-
tinued.
Fortunately, a President's
commission has finally put a
stamp of disapproval on this
plan. The Randall report
states that extensive resort
to commodity agreements
will not solve the problem of
price instability and that
such agreements introduce
restraints that impair "the
elasticity of economic adjust-
ment and the freedom of in-
dividual initiative, which are
fundamental to economic
progress."
The British weekly Econo-
mist commented shortly after
the report's publication that
"this year the natural rubber
industry must work its own
passage, since the Randall
commission's objections to
commodity agreements have
killed any lingering hopes of
stabilizing the price by an in-
ternational buffer stock
scheme."
