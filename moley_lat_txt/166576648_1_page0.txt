THOSE SOPHISTICATED DEMOCRATS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It would be too broad a
characterization to say that
this piece is written in praise
of the leaders of the left side
of the Democratic Party. It
will, however, offer a note of
admiration for their sagacity,
without adding the hope that
they will succeed.
*
For whatever may be said
about the havoc they wrought
when they were in power and
the dangers of letting them
control again, it has to be
acknowledged that they are,
in the fine art of politics, so-
phisticated, professional, ex-
pert, or whatever else you
choose to call people who
know their way about.
"About what?" you may
ask. The answer to that is an-
other story.
It is elementary in political
contests, as in other forms of
competition, that you direct
your attack at any discerni-
ble weakness in your oppo-
nent. If he has a temper that
needs a stiff rein, try to break
his control, and if the effort
is successful, his irrationality
will injure him.
If his following is not well
integrated, try to divide it.
If your own following is
not well integrated, try to
get your adversary to unite it
by generalized attack.
Finally, if your opponent is
politically naive, lead him in-
to damaging statements or ad-
missions.
Most of these rules were fol-
lowed in the recent pother
over so-called "Be Kind to
Democrats" week. And the
harvest was rich.
With this current series of
complaints came a series of
suggestions that Democratic
support would be withheld
if such Republican attacks
continued. This, as well as
the complaints, should have
been laughed off. For neither
Sam Rayburn nor Sen. Sy-
mington nor any other Fair
Deal Democrat can control
the votes of conservative
southern Democrats.
*
But the Democrats appar-
ently knew that the Presi-
dent would respond to these
tactics exactly as they wanted
him to respond. His state-
ments that he believed it
would be unwise to engage in
too partisan attacks were im-
mediately interpreted to be
an attack upon Sen. McCar-
thy and other Republicans
who were out campaigning.
This apparent chastisement
by the President blunted Re-
publican attacks and in some
cases actually prevented
them. Sen. Ferguson, for ex-
ample, went to Brooklyn with
a speech prepared that was
an attack upon past Demo-
cratic rule. He threw his
speech aside and gave a mere
historical summary of the
glories of the Republican
past.
*
In all the chatter that fol-
lowed the President's admoni-
tion there was no attempt to
distinguish between the two
factions in the Democratic
Party. Ex-President Truman
and Sen. Humphrey came un-
der the same protective rule
as Sen. George and Gov.
Byrnes.
Reporters who are looking
for news as well as a chance
to strike a blow against mid-
western Republicans also use
this susceptibility of the
President. Questions in press
conferences are sometimes
phrased like this: "Mr. Presi-
dent, do you endorse the dia-
bolical attacks now being
made by that fiend, Sen.
McWhatsigan?" They are
looking for this sort of an-
swer: "Of course, I never,
never speak of personalities.
But I am against diabolical
attacks by all kinds of fiends."
And the reporters have
their story and the Rayburns
chuckle over their morning
oatmeal and sugar-buns.
