REUTHER'S
ROAD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last week in Detroit public
interest in Sen. McCarthy
and his opponents and
friends was closely pressed
by concern about CIO President
Walter Reuther's sword-
rattling over the old issue of
a guaranteed annual wage.
He seems to have been
speaking mainly as a member
of the Automobile Workers
Union rather than as CIO
president, but the fact that
the steel workers' contract
expires considerably before
the automobile workers' contract
turns the question back
to David McDonald, head of
the steel workers.
★
There are indications that
McDonald will move cautiously
but that next spring
the steel negotiations will begin
with a demand for a 50-
week guarantee. Then, according
to people accustomed
to such negotiations, the demand
will drop to 40 weeks.
If the union should get that
it would be in a position to
demand increases every time
there is a new contract.
There seems to be no need
for alarm by employers about
a real fight over a complete
annual guarantee in the immediate
future. McDonald
himself has cautioned against
that. A modification of the
idea is to require a guarantee
confined only to men of
high seniority. Then, when
slack times come, the men of
low seniority would be first
to be laid off. Management
would then spread out the
work as well as possible
among those under the guarantee.
The fact is that management
generally has been trying
to spread employment
for a long time. This threat
will simply sharpen the effort
to have plans ready for
the next recession.
The extent to which anything
like yearly employment
can be provided, whether
guaranteed by contract or
not, depends upon the nature
of the industry. Newspapers
and magazines, which would
seem to be fairly well able to
provide some sort of assurance,
have apparently never
been asked by the unions for
guarantees.
★
Perhaps the unions follow
a policy of not asking for a
guarantee when they feel
sure they can get it anyhow.
It reminds me of the man
who rushed to a bank upon
which there was a run of depositors.
"If my money's
here," he said, "I don't want
it. If it ain't here, I want it."
Industries, however, in
which competition is very
keen and in which regularity
of demand cannot be anticipated
can do nothing but resist
demands for a guaranteed
annual wage with everything
they have. The automobile
industry is the big example
of that kind.
Men high in the management
of that industry say
they could guarantee annual
wages but only at the sacrifice
of economic freedom.
They could severely limit
production and put prices up.
That would mean a greatly
reduced working staff. It
would mean standardization
of models. It would mean
agreements among the companies
which would not be
allowed now under the antitrust
laws. In short, a cartel
could guarantee employment
to a limited number of workers.
But that would mean less
and less production of real
wealth. It would be the imposition
upon industry of something
like totalitarian control.
It would mean less employment
generally and a lower
standard of living.
But this is what the political
and economic philosophy
of Walter Reuther comes
down to, whether he will admit
it or not. For he is basically
a believer in statism and
only by occupation a labor
boss.
We shall see in 1955 which
of these personal interests
gets the upper hand in the
Reuther mind.
FAMOUS
FABLES
BY E. E. EDGAR
At a banquet in Paris a table
companion offered French
Statesman Georges Clemenceau
a cigarette.
"No, thanks," said the elderly
Premier. "I smoked during
the first 50 years of my
life but I don't intend to
smoke during the second 50."
"How about the third 50?"
asked the other jokingly.
"I shall resume smoking, of
course," said Clemenceau,
"Fifty years of abstinence is
enough."
