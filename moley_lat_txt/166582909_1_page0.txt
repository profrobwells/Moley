THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
What has been popularly
regarded as a hit-and-miss
odyssey of Communists and
fellow travelers in our gov-
ernment departments, agen-
cies, missions, delegations,
Embassies and U.N. offices
can now be recognized as a
definite and planned pursuit
of power. It is the story of a
group of individuals, radicals
as well as subversives, who
knew where the fountain-
heads of power were and
where they were shifting,
and who made it their busi-
ness to reach them.
In the period from 1933 to
1940 the main objectives of
subversives were the infiltra-
tion and, so far as possible,
the control of the purely do-
mestic agencies of govern-
ment.
Almost at the outset of the
Roosevelt administration a
number of people whose
names are now indisputably
associated with Communism
got themselves into the Agri-
cultural Adjustment Admin-
istration. There they worked
to impose the Soviet pattern
upon American agriculture.
With the Wagner Act and
the creation of the NLRB,
the labor target came into
range.
And when a nest was dis-
covered and the occupants
thereof driven out, they
flocked to other alphabetical
agencies. For Civil Service
regulations in those new
agencies were light or non-
existent and employment was
easily obtained.
*
Then the shadow of war
came and it became apparent
that the attention of Roose-
velt, Wallace and others
would be diverted from mak-
ing America over to the vast
stage of the world. When the
war agencies were created,
treason moved into them. For
here the evil band could
wield unheard-of influence
over domestic affairs and try
their hand at world affairs as
well.
But even then there were
farsighted subversives who
realized that with the end of
war our concerns in the in-
ternational field would be
more advantageous to exploit.
Harry Dexter White and Al-
ger Hiss led the way. Many
others followed. And since
1946 it has been the vast bu-
reaucracy that extends from
Washington to all parts of
the world that demands
watching. With open doors,
the United Nations took in
untold numbers of these peo-
ple.
For citizens who may have
lost perspective in the day-
by-day and month-by-month
accounts of the pursuit of
subversives by Congressional
committees and by the agen-
cies of justice, James Burn-
ham's new book, "The Web
of Subversion," offers a clear
and readable summary of the
history of the infiltration of
the Federal government.
Burnham spent months going
through the vast bulk of pub-
lished hearings related to
this story, a task beyond
most of us, gleaned the im-
portant facts, and has woven
them into a gripping account.
In "The Web of Subver-
sion" we see the calculated
seizure of important policy-
making spots in the govern-
ment and the complicated op-
erations of those various
"cells" which have so far
been brought to light. We
see the machinations of the
"Ware cell," the "Silvermas-
ter cell," the "Perlo cell,"
and a fourth group operated
by or, as Burnham puts it,
"handled" by Chambers.
*
These cells had their inter-
connecting links and all
were responsive to a sinister
authority, the exact nature of
which has so far been only
partially revealed. Nor are
we at all certain that even a
fractional number of the cells
have been named and identi-
fied. It may take years to
bring out the entire account,
even with vigorous Congres-
sional committees and the
FBI on the job.
But Burnham has made a
clear picture of what is
available to date.
