DEBUNKING
OF KINSEY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

I am interested in the no-
torious Kinsey report for on-
ly one reason. The immense
popular concern in its find-
ings and the devastating crit-
icism of its scientific preten-
sions may awaken people to
the dangers in such pseudo-
scientific researches in polit-
ical and economic affairs.

There is in the news at the
moment a scathing criticism
of Kinsey, his facts and his
"conclusions" therefrom by
two men whose training and
achievements entitle them to
be heard. They are Edmund
Bergler, M.D., a psychoana-
lytic psychiatrist, and Wil-
liam S. Kroger, M.D., a gyne-
cologist.

*

Their book is called "Kin-
sey's "Myth of Female Sex-
uality." Most of what they
say in the book is irrelevant
to the point I want to make
and, in fact, seems to wan-
der into the same never-nev-
er land of murk which Kin-
sey inhabits. But these doc-
tors are sufficiently familiar
with science and statistics
to make a few points which
in my judgment explode the
entire pretension of science
in the Kinsey report.

The following is the most
significant passage in the
Bergler-Kroger book: "All
these insuperable barriers to
getting at real facts are com-
plicated and made even more
formidable by the faulty com-
position of Kinsey's material
. . . to name only a few
proofs of faulty representa-
tion:

"A—Seventy-five per cent
of his female volunteers have
attended college; in reality,
only 7.5% of American wom-
en go to college.

"B—Out of the 5040 women
interviewed 3313 had never
married. That is 58% of the
total sample. This makes
three times as many spinsters
per hundred as are actually
found in the female popula-
tion of the United States.

"C—Around 60% of those
interviewed belong (at least
tangentially) to the upper
white-collar and professional
groups; this does not corre-
spond at all to actual popu-
lation groupings.

"D—Devout religious
groups (both Catholics and
Jewish) were not sufficiently
represented; their sexual at-
titudes would have consid-
erably changed Kinsey's sta-
tistics.

"E—Regional representa-
tion was also faulty; only 10
States were included in the
sampling.

"Kinsey's basic procedure
contains, therefore, a method-
ological error of the first mag-
nitude, which automatically
cancels out all his conclu-
sions."

Prof. A. H. Hobbs, whose
remarkable book, "Social
Problems and Scientism," I
mentioned in a recent col-
umn, attacks the Kinsey con-
clusions in a slightly different
way:

"However, if the conclu-
sions about sexual behavior
which are emphasized in the
Kinsey report are to be ac-
cepted, some other conclu-
sions which are derived from
projecting its sample to the
total male population must
also be accepted. If the pub-
lic is to accept Prof. Kinsey's
conclusions they must also
believe that:

"A—There are no married
Catholic or Jewish men in
the United States!

"B—Forty-five per cent of
the men in the United States
between the ages of 20 and
50 are either widowed or
divorced!

"C—Seven per cent of all
gainfully occupied males are
engaged in prostitution, i.e.,
that there are some 2,000,000
male prostitutes in the Unit-
ed States!"

This disposes of Kinsey
and, by the same method of
attack, a lot of other nonsense
published in the name of so-
cial science can easily be dis-
proved.
