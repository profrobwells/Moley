On the day when the fate
of the Bricker amendment
was sealed a comment was
made that the fight would be
good and sufficient warning
to our State Department
against bringing back from
Europe agreements which
would risk a new outburst.
On the day when that state-
ment was made, however, the
State Department did exactly
what this prediction denied.
It presented with a fervid
appeal to an advisory com-
mittee of businessmen at the
Commerce Department an
international tin agreement
which embodied all of the
dangers which stimulated
much of the support of the
Bricker and George proposals.
★
And what is worse, the
proponents of that agreement
were very anxious to keep
from the press and the public
the fact that the advisory
committee to which I refer
declared itself decisively
against this proposed interna-
tional tin cartel. There is
vigorous opposition within
the administration to this
agreement. A number of de-
partments are opposed to the
State Department's entire
policy of commodity agree-
ments.
This tin agreement has
been a long time in the inter-
national assembly line. Its
history is too detailed to be
recounted here. Suffice it to
say that it was created at a
conference called by the
United Nations in which both
producing and consuming
countries were represented.
The conference was held at
Geneva in the closing weeks
of 1953. The proposal em-
bodies an elaborate system
of control and price fixing
applying to both producing
and consuming countries.
This international cartel is
put forth, of course, in the
sweet name of "stability," a
word which has become al-
most as popular in Socialistic
circles as "security."
The agreement provides for
an international tin council
to be set up in London. This
council would make decisions
concerning floor and ceiling
prices, export quotas and the
purchases and sales from
what is called the "buffer"
stock. The latter is the sup-
ply which is designed to help
"stabilize" the market.
A number of "votes" are
assigned to each participating
country. The producing coun-
tries have 1000 and the con-
suming countries 1000, A
simple majority of these
votes would be decisive. The
United States, which is, of
course, the biggest consumer,
has 400 votes. It is provided
that while there may be ad-
justments from time to time
in the number of votes given
to each consuming country
there can never be more than
400 assigned to any one coun-
try. This, of course, is intend-
ed to prevent the United
States from getting more
votes, whatever the amount
of tin it may consume.
The cost of this agreement
to the United States would be
in the support given to the
price of tin. The price to the
United States would go up
from its present range of 85
cents a pound to 95. Also if,
as is likely, we shall in the
future cease absorbing all
of the surplus tin from Indo-
nesia, Bolivia and the Belgian
Congo, the price without this
agreement would drop to an
estimated 60 cents a pound.

According to reliable calcu-
lations the increased cost to
American consumers immedi-
ately would be $12,500,000 an-
nually, but later would in-
crease to $45,000,000.
That is what the Ameri-
can consumer would in effect
be taxed for the benefits of
producing countries. And in
the final round that consumer
would be the American
housewife.
In short, this is a way of
providing foreign aid without
an appropriation by Con-
gress. It is a hidden hand-
out.
Since the State Department
probably feels so good after
its victory over the Bricker
and George proposals here is
a good chance for it to show
its courage. I suggest that
Mr. Dulles submit this prod-
uct of his team to the Senate.
If he does, I expect that a
storm will arise which will be
vastly more angry than the
Bricker-George debate.
