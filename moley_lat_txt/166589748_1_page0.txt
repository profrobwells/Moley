Dean Manion could not
have made more clear the
importance of the job from
which he was so summarily
removed than to quote, as he
did in a Meet the Press pro-
gram, something that Dwight
Eisenhower said in Des
Moines during his campaign
in 1952. It was this:
"We will see that the legit-
imate rights of the States
and local communities are
respected. We will not only
stop the taking over of the
tax sources of the State, but
seek reasonably to return
them. And we will not reach
into the States and take from
them their powers and their
responsibilities to serve their
citizens."

But to say that Eisenhower
realized the seriousness of
the problem of Federal-State
relations is not to say that
either he or Sherman Adams
or, in fact, Dean Manion him-
self realized the size of the
job of the Commission on In-
tergovernmental Relations.
Manion warned the Prest-
ident when he was appointed
that he could spend only a
limited amount of his time
on the job. Like a lot of us,
Manion had to make a liv-
ing. The President, accord-
ing to Manion, assured him
that he need spend only a
very few days a month on
the work. Then it seems to
have been assumed that a
report could be prepared be-
tween the first meeting of
the commission last Septem-
ber and March 1.
I have written a number of
pieces on this subject of the
reallocation of tax sources
between the Federal govern-
ment and the States, because
it seems to be the key to the
problem of preserving our
constitutional system and, in
fact, our basic liberties.

For if we ever have a pure-
ly centralized government in
this country it will be a So-
cialist government. For this
reason, I have tried to follow
the research literature on the
subject, and I can offer some
evidence on the time and
effort that such a study
should take.
Shortly after the end of
World War II the research
staff of the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers set to
work on a study of "the re-
allocation of Federal and
State tax resources and serv-
ice responsibilities." The
study was under the general
direction of Dr. Ralph Robey
and Dr. Harley Lutz, who
had already spent years of
their lives on the subject of
taxation. They had a large
and experienced staff assem-
bled at the NAM but the job
took two solid years before
a report was completed in
1949.
On Jan. 5, 1948, the first
Hoover Commission asked
the Council on State Govern-
ments to make a study of
Federal-State relations. Frank
Bane, executive rector of
the council, submitted a volu-
minous report seven months
later. Here also, it should
be noted, a good research
staff was already available.
These two examples show
the size of the job which the
President took so casually.
It may occur to some that
since such work has already
been done there would be lit-
tle need for further research.
That is not true, because this
problem changes with every
year and five years have
elapsed since those studies
were completed.
And now, what with the
summary dismissal of Man-
ion, the resignation of the
executive director of the
commission, and the resigna-
tion of Rep. Noah Mason, the
whole project seems to be
wrecked.
★
Incidentally, Rep. Mason
was the only member of the
commission who had ever
made a really serious study
of the problem.
There were and still are
many excellent members of
the commission, such as Gov.
Shivers. But the only one
who had ever made a pro-
tracted study of the problem
was Rep. Mason. And now
he is gone.
This whole thing is a mat-
ter much more serious than
a dispute about the right of
Manion or anyone else to
freedom of speech. It is the
wreckage of a valuable means
for stopping the onrush of
centralized government.
