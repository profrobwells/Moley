RUSSIAN
GOLD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I wish to disclaim any in-
tention to associate myself
with the anti-anti-Commu-
nists in noting here that
some current fears of Russia
seem a bit silly to me. Fore-
most among the hysterical
proposals included in that
classification is the sugges-
tion that the United States re-
fuse to take any Russian gold
and gold "suspected of being
Russian."

There is no mystery about
the gold that has recently
been coming out of the So-
viet. It is shipped almost en-
tirely to get consumer goods,
presumably to improve the
standard of living which Ma-
lenkov deplored in his speech
last summer.
We should, so far as we
can, see that no strategic ar-
ticles or materials go behind
the Iron Curtain, regardless
of how the price for them is
paid. But to try to determine
which gold comes from Rus-
sia and which comes from
somewhere else is to waste
precious energy.
Such an effort would have
no effect upon the Soviet re-
gime and it would not help
us economically. In fact, it
would cost us some trade that
we need. For the result that
could be expected would be
to provide an excuse for
some European countries to
cut trade with us still more
and to increase their trade
with the Soviet. It would also
provide ammunition for
the Communist propaganda
machine. They would be sure
to say that even when they
try to improve world rela-
tions we refuse to co-operate.
The other evening I heard
a man say that the gold that
the Soviet has been using in
trade recently is simply the
gold that they seized in Spain
during the civil war there
several years ago. That for
him seemed to clinch the ar-
gument—how, I am unable to
fathom. I certainly do not
know whether this is Spanish
gold or not, and I certainly
believe that my friend does
not know either. I also be-
lieve that it makes no differ-
ence now. It seems to me that
such arguments lack ration-
ality.
*
I do know that in those
days nearly 21 years ago,
when it seemed safe to feel
out the intentions of Soviet
Russia and when they had
agents over here trying to
buy things that they needed,
the question of their using
gold came up. At that time,
from March to September,
1933, I happened to be
charged by the President
with such relations as the
State Department had with
the then unrecognized Soviet
Russia.
Over and over, representa-
tives of Amtorg came to talk
about what the Russians
were anxious to buy from us.
These talks were almost al-
ways interesting but fruit-
less. They wanted exactly
the things that the United
States desperately wanted to
sell. But when it came to the
question of what they were
to use for money the con-
versation lagged.
Time after time I asked
whether they had any gold.
We were not so flush with
gold then. Their answer was
that they had lots of gold in
the hills but little in the
treasury. When I asked why
they didn’t dig some out,
these traders would look help-
less and say that such a mat-
ter belonged to some of the
commissars and that they
had no influence over it.
They were sure, however,
that there was plenty of un-
mined gold in Russia and
that its whereabouts was
known.

It is not unreasonable to
suppose that some digging
has been going on during
these years since and that the
product is what is getting in-
to world trade now.
There is $60,000,000,000 in
gold in the world’s monetary
supply, of which we have
$22,000,000,000 and Russia an
estimated $5,500,000,000. So
there is plenty of gold in Eu-
rope to shuffle about. It
would not be difficult for
countries over there to seg-
regate the Russian gold and
to use their own in transac-
tions with us. This would
very simply defeat any effort
on our part to keep Soviet
gold from our shores. There
are other ways to fight the
cold war than an effort of
that kind.
