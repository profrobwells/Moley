M'CARTHY IN REVIEW
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two audacious young men,
William F. Buckley Jr. and
L. Brent Bozell, have contrib-
uted a book which should,
on balance, be a factor in
moderating the national
storm over Sen. McCarthy.
To youth almost alone it is
reserved to brave an effort
like this. But Buckley, the
senior author, is an extraordi-
nary young man, After his
graduation from Yale four
years ago, he set the academ-
ic community agog with his
"God and Man at Yale." The
attacks upon him for that
added no new dignity to his
academic elders, while Buck-
ley kept what seemed to me a
rational calm.
The new book, "McCarthy
and His Enemies," is pro-
McCarthy, with vital reserva-
tions. The effect upon me,
after reading it, was to move
me from somewhere on the
McCarthy side of the line that
divides the Senator from his
critics toward the middle of
the road. Perhaps the authors
did not intend that to be the
effect upon a reader, but it
happened because they have
fairly set forth the opposi-
tion's case as well as their
own frank criticisms of Mc-
Carthy.
On the McCarthy side, they
clearly make the point that
the Senator has done more
than anyone else to alert a
generally complacent nation
to Communism's sinister ef-
forts to entrench itself in vi-
tal places in government and
in the opinion-making strong-
holds of the nation.
They also make the point
that McCarthy, however
crudely, has shown the dan-
gers of liberal tolerance and
indifference to Communism
and the sympathetic bonds be-
tween the authentic Commu-
nists and the Marxian who
undermines faith in our insti-
tutions and traditions in the
name of "liberalism." McCar-
thy has made this demon-
stration, not in the abstract,
but by the presentation of ac-
tual cases, with names and
dates.
In balance, I believe that
the book makes it clear that
the actual injury to innocent
persons has not been great.
Whether, as many critics as-
sert, McCarthy has deeply in-
jured that more subjective
but important element known
to some as "mutual confi-
dence" or to others as "free-
dom of mind," is something
that no book can answer. In
fact, I don't know whether it
can be answered at all.
McCarthy, the authors ad-
mit over and over, "exagger-
ates." They label that as a
venial not a mortal sin. But
I cannot agree that exaggera-
tion is relative, not absolute.
I may feel that Prof. X was
a fool to join subversive or-
ganizations and thus that he
disqualified himself for a po-
sition of trust; but to call
him "disloyal" is to bring a
major and unprovable count
into the indictment.
I may believe that Gen. Y
or Secretary Z by his official
acts precipitated events which
have imperiled our nation,
but to say that he was a par-
ty to a conspiracy is unbe-
lievable and untrue.
By calling a common cold
tuberculosis a doctor could
cause his incredulous patient
to neglect colds altogether.
These exaggerations are not
merely errors of judgment.
They are wrongful acts un-
worthy of people in responsi-
ble places.
I cannot fail to add that
both McCarthy and the au-
thors of this book are terri-
bly confused when they at-
tempt to draw a parallel be-
tween a public prosecutor
and a legislative investigator.
Some of the methods used
may show a superficial identi-
ty. But the distinction is vi-
tal.
The authors make the
point that under immunity a
prosecutor may call a man a
murderer who subsequently
is set free by the jury. The
immunity, however, is es-
sential to the presentation of
a case at law. From that the
authors seem to conclude that
a legislator may hurl char-
acterizations under immuni-
ty which he cannot prove be-
cause it is essential to the
presentation of his case.
But in the case of the man
accused of murder, there is a
means of final judgmentâ€”the
jury and the judges involved.
In the case of a man accused
of disloyalty by a legislator,
there is no final, definitive,
nonanswerable instrument of
judgment.
If there is a loyalty board,
it is a part of the political
administration which is ac-
cused. It can never enjoy the
public prestige and confi-
dence given to the processes
of our judicial system. Our
juristic institutions have the
perfection and prestige of
centuries of trial and error.
Our legislative system is
young in comparison.
But the book, while bear-
ing some few marks of youth
and immaturity, also bears
the marks of sincerity, labor-
ious research and unusually
calm and cogent presenta-
tion. It would have been bet-
ter without the oversmart,
smart-aleck "prologue" by
William Schlamm.
It will be read by many,
many thousands who, after
digesting it, will witness the
great debate with less pas-
sion and more understand-
ing.
