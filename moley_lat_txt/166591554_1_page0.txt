I should not use valuable
space to explain and defend
the right of Congressional
committees to investigate if I
had not heard in recent
weeks, from apparently sane
and educated people, some
strange and dangerous talk.
For this tremendous hulla-
baloo, not to say national
madness, about "you-know-
who" has moved some people
to wonder why Congress
should investigate at all.
To question that right is to
challenge the entire concept
of representative government
and the Constitution which
gives meaning to that con-
cept.
I shall avoid the academic
process of quoting authorities
past and present. A bit of
common sense will do. Con-
gress must be our means of
control over the vast bureauc-
racy which is directly respon-
sible to the President. It
must, through its committees,
maintain a constant surveil-
lance over that bureaucracy.
For a politically constituted
executive department cannot
be trusted with the exclusive
power to police itself.
No man can be a judge in
his own cause. The courts
cannot be the means of con-
trol, for they get before them
only what private citizens or
politically appointed prosecu-
tors may bring to them. The
FBI is responsible to a politi-
cally appointed Attorney Gen-
eral. The press can print
what it knows, but its access
to information is limited.
Congress investigates for
two purposes: First, to get
the information necessary to
guide it in making laws; sec-
ond, to determine how its
laws, including its appropria-
tions, are being carried out.
The process through which
it gathers this essential infor-
mation through scores of
committees and subcommit-
tees is the heart of our free
government. That continuous
process of committee hear-
ings should be and generally
is carried on in a true spirit
of courtesy and co-operation
between members of Con-
gress and members of the ad-
ministration.
It would richly reward any
American to examine in de-
tail the work of just one sub-
committee. Take, for exam-
ple, the subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Com-
mittee which deals with the
Interior Department. Its
hearings extended over sev-
eral weeks in 1953. The record
of those hearings fills four
volumes, some 2500 pages.
The chairman, Ben Jensen of
Iowa, was the essence of cour-
tesy. The members of the In-
terior Department who testf-
fied were equally fair and co-
operative.
Then multiply this mass of
laborious work manyfold
and you have a picture of
government at work. There is
no alternative to such a
process of making govern-
ment responsible to the peo-
ple except dictatorship.
The tragedy of it all, how-
ever, is not the occasional
person who, in his ignorance
or excitement, cries out
against Congress and all its
works. The real injury comes
from those who know exactly
what they are doing when
they traduce Congress and ex-
alt what they call "executive
leadership."
There have been such
voices before in nations
which abandoned parliamen-
tary government, only to find
that the "leader," in whatever
language it was expressed, ul-
timately led his people to
tragic ends.
