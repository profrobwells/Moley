The Sam Rayburn of pre-
Truman days whom I knew
quite well would have been,
I am sure, ashamed of the
sort of speech made recently
against the administration's
tax program.
Perhaps the change in this
amiable, impressionable man
was due to his association with
the demagoguery of H.S.T.
I wondered, in fact, while wit-
nessing the broadcast wheth-
er some mischievous ghost
had played a wicked joke on
this trusting gentleman and
had given him a speech writ-
ten for Wayne Morse. There
was reason for this wonder,
because the gentleman from
Bonham stumbled over the
script as if he had never seen
it before delivery time.
Rayburn made only a pass-
ing reference to the George
plan to raise the exemptions.
Jere Cooper, who also spoke,
ignored it entirely. Both ap-
parently left that difficult mat-
ter of justification to the Sen-
ator from Georgia, who was
laboring at the job when the
show went off the air.

The main theme of Ray-
burn was the iniquity of re-
ducing the burden on invest-
ment caused by the double
taxation of profits from indus-
try. In other words, the tax
on dividends. The entire ar-
gument of all three gentlemen
is based on the false premise
that tax reform, involves re-
warding the good and punish-
ing the bad. In the Rayburn
philosophy the good are the
people in the lower brackets
and the bad are the well-to-do.
But the purpose of taxation
is to raise revenue. Fairness
Sam Rayburn
is an essential element, but
fairness does not mean mere-
ly "ability to pay." This idea
is a part of the Marxian ex-
pression "from each accord-
ing to his ability, to each ac-
cording to his need."
The Rayburn thesis is that
if there is any gravy to be
served, the people in the low-
er income brackets should be
served and the people in the
higher brackets should go on
as before. He does not meet
the argument for the partial
removal of double taxation
on the basis of fairness. He
also seems, to assume that
the rich have been battening
all along by tax favors.
The fact is that the rich and
the middle-income people
have been soaked and soaked
again. The relative burdens
have already been adjusted
to accomplish what Mr. Ray-
burn wants. A single figure
will show that. If all of the
income of individuals getting
over $10,000 were taxed 100%,
instead of the present rates,
the additional revenue would
be only $4,700,000,000. That
would pay the expenses of
the Federal government for
about four weeks. Somebody
must pay for the other 48
weeks at the present rate of
spending.,
Another fallacious assump-
tion in the Rayburn speech
is that stock ownership lies
almost exclusively with the
rich. The fact is that since
we have been able to com-
pile any reliable income fig-
ures (around 1916), the num-
ber owning stock has in-
creased many-fold and the
trend of the major possession
of the industrial plant
through stock has been steadi-
ly toward the people in the
lower brackets.

Moreover, due to double
taxation, the amount realized
from a dollar of extra profit
in a corporation which final-
ly finds its way to the owner
of stock has been getting less
and less. Fox example, if you
are a married man getting be-
tween $2000 and $4000 a year
after deductions and exemp-
tions, the company in which
you own stock must earn ap-
proximately $3 before you
get S1. The government gets
the rest. The "bad" people in
the brackets around $50,000
get $1 while the government
gets $4 from additional in-
come earned.
None of the three gentle-
men tackled the basic issue
raised by by President Eisen-
hower, which is that every-
one-or nearly everyone-
should participate in the sup-
port of government, even
though some pay only a little
