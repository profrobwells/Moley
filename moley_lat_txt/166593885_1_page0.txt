SEN. BRICKER'S COMPROMISE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This week's respite in the
Senate debate on the various
proposals of constitutional
amendments on the treaty
power offers a chance for laymen
to examine the amended
proposal of Sen. Bricker
and his advisers.
Such an examination will
show plainly that the Bricker
supporters are willing to go
to most ample lengths to
meet the objections, mostly
fictitious, of the President
and the State Department.
people who are advising him.
It will also show the narrow
margin between the
George amendment and the
new Bricker version. With
that gap closed, there will be
enough votes to pass an
amendment, whether the administration agrees or not.
The vital points in the new
Bricker resolution, with some
explanation of each, are as
follows:
Section 2 simply asserts
that "a provision of a treaty
or other international agreement which conflicts with
this Constitution shall not be
of any force or effect." This
was, in fact, in the proposed
substitute offered at the instance of the administration
last summer and introduced
by Sen. Knowland.
Section 3 states that "a
treaty or other international
agreement shall become effective as internal law in the
United States only through
legislation by Congress, unless in advising and consulting to a treaty the Senate,
by a vote of two-thirds of the
Senators present and voting,
shall provide that such treaty
may become effective without
legislation." This is a modification of Section 2 of the old
Bricker amendment. It drops
the controversial "which"
clause and substitutes the
language that follows the
word "unless."

What the first part of this
means is, in lawyer's language, a statement that treaties and agreements shall not
be "self-executing" so far as
international law is concerned. This means that matters which are within the internal affairs of the nation
and the States which treaties
or agreements affect must be
passed in the form of ordinary legislation by Congress.
The great hullabaloo about
every agreement, etc., going
to 48 States is eliminated. It
means, in short, that the legislative power, which, according to the Constitution, "shall
be vested in a Congress,"
shall not be exercised by the
President and the Senate
alone.

It then goes further in
order to meet the opposition's objections that in some
cases speed is necessary. It
provides that the Senate may
provide in such expeditious
cases that legislation will be
unnecessary. Note that this
proviso applies to treaties,
not executive agreements.
This provision more than
meets the George proposal.
Section 4 merely provides
that on the question of the
ratification of a treaty the
Senators present and voting
shall answer a roll call and
be recorded. This would prevent hasty action. Last July,
for example, the international
wheat agreement was
jammed through without a
record vote. It has already
cost us $600,000,000, and last
month the Randall commission, appointed by the President, to report on foreign
trade, roundly condemned it.
The way is now open to a
peaceful solution of this controversy. The next move is
up to the President.
