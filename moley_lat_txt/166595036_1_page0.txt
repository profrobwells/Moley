THE ART OF
PROPHECY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Now that the season is here
when predictions are busting
out all over, I shall make my
modest contribution and then,
in line with my well-estab-
lished practice, warn every-
body of the dangers and fal-
lacies in making any predio-
tions at all.
My predictions are:
1-There will be lots of
business in 1954.
2-The rate of baby produo-
tion will be normal-what-
ever normal may be.
3-The campaign for the
control of Congress will be
hotly contested.
4-The Boston Red Sox will
not win the pennant. This is
based upon the fact that for
a long time the BRS were
regularly picked and did not
win.
Now for an explanation of
my technique. As you will
see, I am safe on three of
these. So I shall, in any event,
be able to claim a rate of ac-
curacy of 75%. As to the Red
Sox, I really stick my neck
out. But they will either win
the pennant or they will not
win the pennant. If they do
not, I shall be the peerless
predictor. If they do, I shall
have that nice soft 75% to
fall back upon.
A devastating attack not on-
ly on the pretensions of most
predictions in the so-called
social sciences but also on the
basic assumption that such
disciplines are sciences at all
is contained in a recently
published book which on my
calendar is the book of the
month, possibly of the year.

It is "Social Problems and
Scientism," by Prof. A. H.
Hobbs of the University of
Pennsylvania. Among the
many books on the social
studies that I have read over
the years, this ranks near the
top. As in the case of many
books that represent conserv-
ative thinking these days, it
found hard going before a
publisher was willing to
bring it out. And as is true
of many of the currently
sound books, it ultimately
was accepted by a small pub-
lisher, the Stackpole Co. of
Harrisburg, Penn.
Prof. Hobbs makes the
most important point that
most of the justifications for
radical revisions of the social
order, including socialistic
planning, are on the basis of
half-baked predictions.
But when checked later,
most such predictions are
found to be erroneous. Even
in economics, the most highly
developed of the social
studies, there has been plenty
of error. A very distinguished
economist made a check of
the various predictions of
economists on the course of
business and found them to
be only 33% correct. This
suggests that the simple
method of guessing on the
turn of a coin might be bet-
ter, since that offers half a
chance of being correct. The
estimate by the expensive
Bureau of Labor Statistics of
7,000,000 unemployed in 1949
is well remembered.

In the more immature so-
cial studies such as sociology
the record is fantastic. Prof.
Hobbs points out several ex-
amples, of which the follow-
ing are typical:
"Social scientists have pre-
dicted that increased educa-
tion would reduce the divorce
rate. We have the increased
education, but the divorce
rate went up instead of down.
It has been repeatedly pre-
dicted that improvement in
the standard of living would
reduce the divorce rate. The
standard went up, but so did
the divorce rate. It has
been "predicted that educa-
tion and improved standards
of living would reduce de-
linquency. We have more
education than ever before,
higher standards of living
than ever before—and more
delinquency than ever be-
fore."
I cannot do better than to
end this New Year's message
with the suggestion that the
Hobbs book is an excellent
way to gain measurable im-
munity against the claims of
fraudulent prophets.
