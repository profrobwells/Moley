TIME FOR
REASON
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A good many days ago I
had resolved that at least
this commentator would
stay away from the storm
that swirls around the name
of Sen. McCarthy until the
skies were clear enough to
see the stars of reason and
logic.
But for reasons only one of
which I propose to mention
today, the tempest grows
more intense day by day. Per-
haps even now this comment
will be seized upon by some
as new ammunition for one
side or the other. Certainly
I entertain no illusion that
it can be of much help in
calming things down. But
with equal certainty I feel
that it can do no harm.

â˜…

One of the most violent
critics of McCarthy has been
the Washington Post. But in a
recent editorial it deplores a
sermon delivered by the Rev.
Dr. Robert J. McCracken of
the Riverside Church in New
York. The Post quotes Mc-
Cracken as saying that
McCarthy is "a member of a
church that has never dis-
avowed the Inquisition, that
makes a policy of censorship,
that insists on conformity."
I have not seen the rest of
the McCracken sermon, but
this is enough to make my
point.
McCracken is a notable name
in American religious circles
largely because he is pastor
of a famous church and be-
cause he was chosen to suc-
ceed the distinguished Emer-
son Fosdick. His biography
indicates a steady rise in the
church with which he has
been affiliated. He was born
in Scotland and educated
there. Until he reached the
age of 34 he preached in vari-
ous churches in Scotland and
lectured in a college on the-
ology. Then he came to Ham-
ilton, Ont., where he taught
theology until 1946, when he
was called to the Riverside
Church.

Presumably, Dr. McCracken
has been admitted to Ameri-
can citizenship and is a resi-
dent, not a guest, of the Unit-
ed States. Therefore, he is en-
titled to participate in our
political squabbles as much
as he feels it is wise to do.
But when he does, he should
know that it is not in the
best American tradition to
drag religion into politics.
He is, it is true, of a tradi-
tion in which politics has
been to a degree interwoven
with religious issues. But
England and Scotland are
small, homogeneous, and ac-
customed to interreligious
controversy. Aside from an
occasional bashed-in head, no
serious results accrue.
But the United States is a
vast country with millions of
former immigrants, with a
racial problem of stupendous
proportions, and with a
smarting memory of such
movements as Know Nothing-
ism, the APA, and the Klan.
To play with fire in a teacup
is one thing. To get careless
with matches in the red-
woods is another.
Support of our opposition
to McCarthy has not followed
religious lines.

It is hardly relevant here to
point out the absurdity of
dragging the Inquisition into
the current discussion. I am
no church historian and I
shall not argue the point
whether the Catholic Church
has disavowed the Inquisi-
tion. Nor shall I assume, as
many do, that the Inquisition
was good or bad.
The United States has done
some things in history for
which I am ashamed, but I
never expected Congress to
disavow acts of long ago.
Nor, so far as I know, has
the British Parliament dis-
avowed had things which
England did to McCracken's
native land in ages past.
This religious leader might
well note, however, that the
Catholic clergy during the Al
Smith campaign of 1928
maintained silence in the
face of violent controversy.
The pastor of the Riverside
Church might well keep his
political comments free of
far-off times and battles long
ago.
Otherwise, McCrackenism
may be an issue as well as
McCarthyism.
