Lovers of our national
parks and monuments are
quite legitimately concerned
about the partiality shown to
the Reclamation Bureau and
the neglect of the national
parks in the Interior Depart
ment appropriation bill re
cently passed by the House.
They hardly realize, how-
ever, that there is pending
before Congress authorization
for a still greater handout to
irrigation and power in the
Upper Colorado project.
In the appropriations for
fiscal 1954 the parks were
given almost $34,000,000. This
year the department asked
for approximately $28,500,000.
The House cut that to $26,000,-
000.
On the other hand, the de
partment submitted reclama-
tion requests of $155,000,000
for fiscal 1955, which was far
greater than the $143,600,000
appropriated for 1954. The
House slashed that to $140,-
000,000. This, the park lovers
complain, is only a cut of
2.5%, while the parks suffered
a cut of nearly 24%.
No one can quarrel with the
necessity of continuing most
of the many projects for pow-
er and irrigation which previ-
ous Congresses started. But
scattered throughout the vast
detail submitted by the In-
terior Department to Con-
gress are controllable extrava-
gances and subtly hidden sub-
sidies for uneconomic but po-
litically supported irrigation
projects.
In fact, there are projects
in this omnibus bill in which
irrigated land is being pre-
pared by the government for
which the people who will
use it will pay practically
nothing. This land will be
supported by power projects
for which the taxpayer will
pay interest for half a century
to come.
Meanwhile, the department
and the President have
recommended a series of enor-
mous projects for power and
irrigation in the Upper Colo-
rado Valley which will saddle
the taxpayer with hundreds
of millions of dollars in sub-
sidies.
While Secretary Ickes enter-
tained a sentimental regard
for the parks, his consuming
passion and that of his suc-
cessors was for the socializa-
tion of electric power. In or-
der to accomplish that he
secured political support in
the various arid States by
permitting larger and larger
subsidies to be given for irri-
gation.
The day is long past when
irrigation has an economic
value. And there is the fur-
ther argument that at a time
when the government is
pouring out hundreds of mil-
lions to support and absorb
agricultural surpluses, it is
absurd to add to that surplus
at the expense of further mil-
lions in irrigation subsidies.
The parks and monuments
are showing glaring signs of
neglect. They are being op-
erated with only a fraction of
the caretaking manpower
that they had in 1941. The
Congress at the instance of
the President has just given
the States close to a billion
dollars for highways, while
the highways and roads in the
parks are falling into disre-
pair which is in some in-
stances a hazard to life and a
complete deterrent to pleas-
ure.
It would seem that the
40,000,000 Americans who find
their annual outings at the
parks deserve priority over
the handful who will profit
by irrigation, But, as in many
other aspects of Federal af-
fairs, the concentrated few
can command more political
force than the scattered mil-
lions.
