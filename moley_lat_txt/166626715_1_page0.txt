SINGLE SNIPER SNARLS A PROBE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The parliamentary crisis
which has overtaken the
House Committee on Tax-
Exempt Foundations raises
two questions of great pub-
lic interest.
This committee, which was
designed to continue studies
started in the previous Con-
gress by the Cox committee,
was authorized last July. Car-
roll Reece of Tennessee was
designated as chairman, with
two Republican colleagues,
Wolcott of Michigan and
Goodwin of Massachusetts,
and two Democrats, Wayne
Hays of Ohio and Gracie
Pfost of Idaho. Rene Worm-
ser, a lawer from New York
with wide experience in trust
and estate work, was chosen
chief counsel.
Under the resolution creat-
ing the committee, it was di-
rected to determine whether
tax-exempt educational and
philanthropic foundations are
using their funds (a) for pur-
poses other than those for
which they were established,
or (b) for un-American and
subversive purposes, or (c)
for political purposes, propa-
ganda or attempts to in-
fluence legislation.
The attitude of the chair-
man and counsel from the
beginning has been to recog-
nize that foundations have
been a vast influence for good
in natural science and medi-
cine; that since they have
ventured into what is called
social science there have
been certain responsible criti-
cisms, and that it is the job
of this committee to hear
those criticisms and to give
the foundations a full oppor-
tunity to answer them.
Hearings began with re-
ports from the research staff
and a number of critics. They
have now started to hear the
foundations.
However, in the six weeks
of hearings things have gone
at a snail's pace, almost en-
tirely because of the obstruc-
tive tactics of Rep. Hays.
There have been days when
his interruptions have been
almost continuous. Those in-
terruptions have consisted of
questions relevant and irrele-
vant, speeches, charges of bad
faith against the majority
members and the staff, and
abuse of witnesses.
This has, of course, ob-
structed and confused the or-
derly presentation of testi-
mony. Things have now
reached the point where it
would seem impossible to
continue the public hearings.
The first issue raised is sim-
ply this: Is one member of a
committee to be given the
unrestricted right to frus-
trate the purposes of a meas-
ure passed by the House of
Representatives? Once more
and in a particularly virulent
way we have the indefensi-
ble abuse of the power of
Congressional investigation.
This time, not by a commit-
tee or its chairman but by a
single member.
Another issue is raised by
certain criticisms of the com-
mittee. Those criticisms go so
far as to question whether
Congress has the right or
that conditions suggest the
need for any investigation of
these tax-exempt institutions.
It should be realized by all
concerned that tax exemption
means that the many millions
spent by the institutions are
vested with a public interest.
For every dollar of tax ex-
emption means another dol-
lar raised from the taxpayers.
The proper representation
and protection of the in-
terests of those taxpayers is
in the Congress. This is espe-
cially true since the funds
available for spending by
foundations amount to tens
of millions annually. It is
true, too, because the con-
trol of that spending, especial-
ly by the larger foundations,
is concentrated in a relative-
ly few people.
The House should not only
bring order into its investiga-
tions but render a fair and
full report in accordance with
its expressed intention.
