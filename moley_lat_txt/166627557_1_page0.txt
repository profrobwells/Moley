BUREAUS
WIN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY.
The resignation of Budg-
et Director Dodge to return to
his private business interests
brings to light once more a
disturbing trend in our gov-
ernment in Washington. For
the services of capable busi-
ness and professional men in
the Federal government are
becoming more and more
transitory, while the perma-
nent employees become
more permanent and vastly
more numerous.
The end, which may not be
far distant, will be govern-
ment of the people, for the
people and by the bureauc-
racy.

I am not sure that the ex-
perience of Mr. Dodge fol-
lows the familiar pattern,
since I do not know him and
have no so-called inside in-
formation. But the usual pro-
cedure is the calling of a
man of proved capacity to
Washington by the President
or by a department head with
an offer of a job or assign-
ment of some kind. The offer
takes the form of a plea be-
cause such people seldom are
attracted by public service.
Then the man goes to
work and must spend a con-
siderable time learning his
way about the department.
He usually finds that he
must depend upon the lesser
people who have been there
a long time. Sometimes
these bureaucrats almost
completely take him over. If
they do not, his life is not
a happy one, for it is not
pleasant work with unsym-
pathetic people. Then, his
year is up and he leaves.
A President grows weary
of urging people to respond
to the call of public duty and
almost invariably suc-
cumbs to the temptation to
give the job to a political
hack or to promote a bureau-
crat. In either case, the bu-
reaucracy wins out.
Thus, there is a progressive
decline in the quality of lead-
ership. Witness as a good
example the deterioration of
the RFC after the departure
of Jesse Jones.
Multiply such instances
manyfold and you have the
situation which prevails in
Washington.
The efforts of Congress to
reduce the size of the bu-
reaucracy are at the moment
inconsequential. Sen. Byrdâ€™s
latest figures on civilian em-
ployment tell the story. From
July 1, 1953, to the end of
February, 1954, there has
been a decline in such jobs
from 2,454,714 to 2,310,767.
That is a reduction of only
5%. And it has been possible
largely because the Depart-
ment of Defense has, under
Wilson and Kyes (who has
also gone back to private
life), been able to cut civilian
employment to a degree be-
cause of the end of the Ko-
rean war.
But in a number of depart-
ments there is already an in-
crease over 1953. The Feb-
ruary figures cited by Byrd
show increases in the Depart-
ments of State, Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare, Agri-
culture, Interior, Treasury
and the Veterans Adminis-
tration.
Over the centuries France,
Germany, Czarist and now
Communist Russia have all
gone the way of bureaucracy.
But we have, until recent
years, been free of such a
deadening influence in our
life. Now, however, Amer-
icans may well be warned
that what has happened in
other, older countries is hap-
pening here at an alarming
rate.
