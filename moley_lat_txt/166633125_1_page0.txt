LOYALTY
TO GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

With a persistence which
cannot be discounted, reliable
political reporters in Wash-
ington are saying that the
White House and the Repub-
lican National Committee will
insist upon what amounts to
a test of loyalty to the Eisen-
hower program from candi-
dates for the House and the
Senate this fall.

The penalty for a failure to
meet this test is variously de-
scribed, from denial of cam-
paign funds to a denial of
White House support.
There will be no individual
endorsements or denuncia-
tions by the President, but
the inference may well be
made clear that this or that
heretic is operating on his
own so far as the President is
concerned.

One report which I have
not seen officially announced
is that a slogan for 1954 will
be: "Ike is a Republican—
are you?"

It is also being said that
the so-called Citizens for Ei-
senhower will be very active,
with money and other forms
of support, for only those Re-
publicans who have support-
ed the President's program.
This sort of thing may, of
course, be merely a means of
getting enacted in Congress
the parts of the President's
program that are still pend-
ing. In that respect it re-
sembles the diplomatic bluff-
ing that may be going on in
Geneva on all sides.

But any real requirement
of strict orthodoxy is always
risky business. A national po-
litical party is a pretty loose-
ly constructed affair. There
may be a Democratic Byrd
and a Democratic Humphrey
or Lehman. There may be a
Democratic Frank Lausche
and a Democratic Mennen
Williams. Those contrasts
suggest political philosophies
worlds apart. They cannot be
made to respond to a com-
mon command.

A pledge of loyalty to the
Eisenhower program would
require that certain tests be
specifically defined.

In the first place, what is
the program? Roughly, it
might be said to include
among other things the new
revisions of the revenue act,
the housing program, the
highway grant to the States,
the St. Lawrence Seaway, the
flexible price supports for
the farmers, the liberalized
tariff proposal, foreign aid, a
wire-tap law, and votes for
18-year-olds.

Some of these have already
been rejected. Others have
been enacted. Most are still
in the works.

The votes, so far as there
have been votes, show pret-
ty widespread bolting on the
part of the Republicans and
Democrats alike. That is as it
always has been, especially
in recent years. The lines of
ideology are deeper than the
lines of party.

Just what proportion of the
President's wishes must have
been voted for in order to
qualify for the White House
blessing? The Congressman
or Senator is sometimes con-
fused, and rightly so.

For example, the President
has helped to set up the new
Hoover Commission. Presum-
ably it is a part of the pro-
gram which he considers nec-
essary. But he has also pre-
sented to Congress the gigan-
tic Upper Colorado storage
and irrigation project.

The Hoover task force deal-
ing with reclamation is in
general opposed to this pro-
posal. Is approval of the proj-
ect a requirement for ortho-
doxy? There are other similar
examples of dilemmas for
candidates.

The real fact is that candi-
dates will pretty much be on
their own. If they feel that
the prestige of the President
will help, they will tell the
voters about the Eisenhower
measures they have support-
ed. If they feel otherwise,
they will discuss other things.
Each candidate in his own
way offers such appeals to
the voters as he thinks will
get him votes. What will be
offered will depend upon
many factors—sectional, oc-
cupational, or ideological.
Orthodoxy is not an Ameri-
can political habit.
