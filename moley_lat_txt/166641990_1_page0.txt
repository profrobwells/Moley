With a cynical disregard of
all that the Republican Party
and its candidate said in 1952
about balanced budgets and
economy in government, a
Senate subcommittee has
rushed through hearings on a
bill authorizing the gigantic
Upper Colorado storage proj-
ect,
The initial cost now threat-
ens to be something like $500,-
000,000 or even $1,000,000,000
more than the proposal re-
ported by the House commit-
tee.
If passed, this will obligate
the taxpayers of the nation
over the years to come to pay
two or three times that cost
in subsidies on irrigated land,
at a rate of something like
$2700 an acre.
In the project as recom-
mended by the President and
passed by a margin of one
vote by the House Interior
and Insular Affairs Commit-
tee there were two very large
power and storage dams and
12 "participating projects."
The latter were almost entire-
ly for irrigation.
These 12 were artfully dis-
tributed among the States of
Colorado, Utah, New Mexico
and Wyoming, thus assuring
the maximum political sup-
port in Congress.
A 13th project, a very ex-
pensive one, the Navajo-Ship-
rock project in New Mexico,
was deferred by the Presi-
dent, apparently to bring the
estimated cost just below a
billion dollars.
The getting of this through
the House committee was
achieved by some masterful
logrolling. But strong oppo-
sition came from California,
and from organizations of na-
ture lovers who were against
the desecration of the Dino-
saur National Monument.
There were private objec-
tions from the Hoover Com-
mission. The result was that
the House Rules Committee
firmly opposed action,
The proceedings in the Sen-
ate Subcommittee of the In-
terior and Insular Affairs
Committee were a travesty.
Apparently everything was
decided in advance. During a
good portion of the hearings
only one member was pres-
ent.
To make matters very con-
siderably worse, the Senate
managers of the bill have
made reckless proposals to
add new and expensive proj-
ects. Sen. Anderson of New
Mexico called for the addition
of the Navajo-Shiprock proj-
ect, and he will be accom-
modated. Then followed pro-
posals for the addition of sev-
eral more projects in Colora-
do, New Mexico, and Wyo-
ming. All these add up to an
over-all plan which even the
wildest proponents hesitated
to include in the original bills.
It is anticipated that the
Senate will slap the whole
thing through, with objec-
tions perhaps from only such
indomitable enemies of wild
spending as Sens, Douglas and
Byrd. This will indeed be the
cream of the jest a few
lonely Democrats standing
against this Republican re-
gime which is pledged to
economy.
The one hope is that this
display of sectional interest
and reckless haste will so
alert the House that the wa-
terlogged bill will founder
there. Or if by any chance
the bill should pass, the Presi-
dent, it is hoped, will kill the
whole measure with a veto.
For this seems to be too
heavy a price for improving
Republican chances in the
four Mountain States. This is
indeed a monstrous revival
of the pork-barrel legislation
of days long gone by.
