DEWEY'S
ADIEU
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Tom Dewey was 14
he was probably a boy who
before going to bed carefully
folded his trousers in
the creases, laid each stocking
over its appropriate shoe
and entered into slumber
without rumpling the sheets.
In school he probably was
the source of both pride and
exasperation to his teachers:
pride because he studied and
prepared his work with neat-
ness and dispatch; exasperation
because he was tireless-
ly inquisitive.
These characteristics in his
career in politics have been
both an asset and a fatal lia-
bility. For his interrogations
antagonize politicians who
are, as a class, never too
sure about their facts.
His manner in eliciting in-
formation often approaches
the verge of bad manners.
His ruthless way of main-
taining discipline among his
followers, so obvious in the
1952 Republican Convention,
infuriates while it compels.

But before this account of
Dewey's not wholly lovable
characteristics go too far let
me add that I never have
known a man of major pro-
portions in public life who
held so firmly the loyalty and
affection of the people imme-
diately around him. Note that
I say "immediately around
him," for this affection never
penetrated to the rank and
file of the Republican politi-
cians of New York State.
Those politicians need him
just as a child needs spinach.
They've grown strong with
Dewey up there at the head
of the ticket after lean liv-
ing for 32 years under Democratic
Governors.
But it cannot be said that
Dewey is beloved. There are
district clubs where his pic-
ture is never displayed except
during campaigns. There
may be framed on their
walls the Tafts, father and
son, and McKinley and Coolidge
and T.R. But Dewey is
not among the permanent ornaments.
★
Perhaps that is how the
generality of people in New
York feel about their Governor.
To their credit and to
their profit they let their
good sense rather than their
emotions control their votes.
For Dewey gives the State of
New York efficient and honest
government of a quality
rarely found in these United
States.
In his campaigns for the
Presidency, especially the one
in 1948, it was Dewey's tragedy,
and the nation's, too, that
he failed to include in his
methodical preparations
which seemed to involve
everything, the very quality
which he possessed in greatest
supply. He seemed to be
the last person to recognize
that he was an administrative
genius.
★
He believed that he was par
excellence a prosecutor, a
scourger of the delinquent
and disorderly. And he was
all of that too. But to his
eternal frustration people
persuaded him in 1948 to rise
to empyrean heights and talk
in the manner of a Burke or
a Woodrow Wilson.
Dewey is not at home in
that atmosphere and everybody
but Dewey and his
speech writers realized it. He
also forgot that with a personality
methodical and efficient
as his, a conservative
program is appropriate. But
again he was convinced by
people around him that the
way to get elected was to
seem so much like the phony
humanitarians in the other
party that voters would be
unable to make a distinction.
★
The voters were yearning
for efficient and honest and
conservative government and
Candidate Dewey failed to
make them realize that he
was just the man to provide
these. They had been living
on high thinking and low
achievement long enough.
And so 42,000,000 eligibles
stayed home including a large
part of the Republican Party.
There is always the chance
for a change of plans. Dewey
has "retired" before. But if
this decision is firm the State
of New York will lose an
asset of almost priceless
value, a superlatively able
public servant.
