REASON'S
VOICE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Back there in the days
when schoolboys sharpened
their English on Daniel Web-
ster and Edmund Burke,
they knew by heart the open-
ing lines of the memorable
reply to Hayne.
Memory slips a bit on this,
but the gist was that Webster
told the Senate that after the
many days of storm, wise
mariners, at the first break,
consulted their instruments
and the sky to see where
they were.
It might be well for all of
us whose sensibilities have
lost track of things in the
howling storm of words ut-
tered by the opponents of the
atomic energy bill to go
back to the beginning of this
debate and read the meas-
ured and reasonable speech
of a Democrat who has in
this instance kept faith with
the finer traditions of his par-
ty, John O. Pastore of Rhode
Island. His speech, I believe,
is the best of all the utter-
ances in this long session.

Pastore is a member of the
Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy, which was formerly
and creditably headed by the
late Sen. McMahon and of
which the chairman is now
Rep. W. Sterling Cole of New
York.
It is in the main a fine
committee with foremost
representatives of both par-
ties and of both houses of
Congress.
This committee, Pastore
said, gave the bill "the most
scrupulous kind of study.
During the present session of
the Congress, the committee
has held more than 70 meet-
ings, both in executive and
public session. Witnesses
from every phase of our soci-
ety were heard.
"Many hours were devoted
in refining the manifold pro-
visions of the bill... the
fact that the members of the
joint committee have come
into accord on the broad fea-
tures of this proposed legisla-
tion is, in my opinion, its
greatest compliment.
Throughout the entire delib-
erations on this bill the
members have demonstrated
an exemplary spirit of non-
partisanship."

Pastore made clear that he,
as well as other members of
the committee, worked sym-
pathetically to achieve in the
bill the three objectives
stated by the President.
These were increased co-op-
eration with our allies in the
use of atomic power, im-
proved procedures for con-
trolling atomic information,
and the encouragement of
private participation in the
development of peacetime
atomic power. The bill, Pas-
tore asserted, did achieve
those ends.
He went on to point out
that he had always believed
in the TVA, in rural electrifi-
cation and in the great power
projects of the Northwest.
Pastore cannot be convict-
ed as an enemy of proper
government enterprise. He
assured his colleagues who
were afraid of private mo-
nopoly that no such thing
would be possible under the
provisions of the bill.
He said: "...this legisla-
tion does not prejudge the
question of whether atomic
power someday will be gener-
ated primarily by privately
owned utilities or by public
power corporations... the
problem that we face today
...is a problem of devising
ways and means of encourag-
ing an attack on the scientific
and engineering problems
which must be solved before
power from the atom can be
competitive with electricity
secured from conventional
fuels."
Despite this assurance,
some of his colleagues inject-
ed the most violent partisan-
ship, not to say demagoguery,
into the debate. This was not
the conduct of a responsible
party. It was the conduct of
an irresponsible minority
willing to use this serious
problem for selfish ends.
