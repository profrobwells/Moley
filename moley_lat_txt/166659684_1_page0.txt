RAYMOND MOLEY:
Personality Tests Are
Far From Perfect
Perhaps it is in part be-
cause high taxes encourage
the spending of money for
deductible purposes and part-
ly because in a competitive
world everybody is seeking a
sure thing, businessmen have
become a notoriously soft
touch for all sorts of economic
services, political dope sheets,
polling activities and tests
of all sorts.
Some of the most flourish-
ing of the industries that live
off industry are the agencies
that purport to tell employers
exactly what to do about their
employees—which ones will
succeed and at what, which
ones to fire, which ones to
watch—and among appli-
cants for jobs which ones to
hire and which ones to reject.

It deserves to be said that
reasonable testing by ques-
tions and the like, adminis-
tered with discretion and
common sense, is legitimate,
necessary, and quite useful.
But it is apparently much
easier to sell "science" than
common sense, and the agen-
cy that lifts the entire burden
of thinking from the top ex-
ecutive is greeted with open
arms.
A most revealing article ex-
posing the fallacies and pre-
tensions of some of these test-
ing agencies is published in
Fortune for September. It is
called "The Fallacies of 'Per-
sonality Testing," and its au-
thor is William H. Whythe
Jr.
If I were the head of a
large corporation, I would
provide every officer of my
company, every straw boss
and the entire personnel de-
partment with a copy, and I
would once and for all re-
solve to have no part of these
new excursions into pseudo-
science.

For some of the tests ex-
hibited in the article are not
only useless per se, but an
indefensible invasion of the
sacred privacy of an Ameri-
can citizen. I, for one, would
have to be starving to submit
myself to such tests.
One of the conclusions of
the author of the Fortune ar-
ticle deserves to be high-
lighted:
"The tests, Fortune sub-
mits, do not do what they are
supposed to do because,
for one thing they are not
scientific. Neither in the ques-
tions nor in the evaluation
are they neutral; they are,
instead, loaded with debat-
able assumptions and ques-
tions of values. The result,
deliberate or not, is a set of
yardsticks that reward the
conformist, the pedestrian,
the unimaginative—at the ex-
pense of the individual whom
management most needs to
attract."
★
To prove its point Fortune
secured the co-operation of
14 successful corporation
presidents and board chair-
men. It gave these people
one of the tests.
The result was that not
one corporation president
fell within the "acceptable"
range, and two failed to meet
the minimum "profile" for
foremen.
Only three presidents an-
swered more than half of the
questions correctly. Thus,
either 14 successful corpora-
tions are headed by incompe-
tent people, or the tests are
not valid.
The article offers a num-
ber of sample lists with which
the reader can get an idea of
himself. I amused myself by
giving myself the "A-S Re-
action Study" test.

This is supposed to measure
people on a scale running
from extremely submissive to
positive and opinionated. This
was important to me because
I have been accused, because
of my writings in this col-
umn and elsewhere, of being
pretty sure of myself.
I have expressed opinions
on a vast number of subjects
and have entered innumer-
able controversies.
I am sure that my critics
who have accused me of be-
ing cocksure and excessive-
ly opinionated will be relieved
to know how I rated in the
test.
I turned up among the
most submissive people in the
world. I am, according to the
test, another Casper Milque-
toast.
This would have complete-
ly disqualified me for the job
which I have enjoyed these
many years. But I assure my
readers that it is too late to
change now. Anyhow, these
"scientific" people have giv-
en me another subject to be
"submissive" about.
