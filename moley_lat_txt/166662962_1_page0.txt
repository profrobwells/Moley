It may have been that sheer
modesty prompted Chairman
Lewis L. Strauss of the
Atomic Energy Commission
to seek to prevent the publi-
cation of Shepley and Blair's
book, "The Hydrogen Bomb."
But there must have been
more substantial reasons
than that.
He felt, no doubt, that since
he and his colleagues had
concluded the Oppenheimer
case with firmness and dis-
patch, the interests of the
country would be well served
by directing attention away
from the mistaken views held
some years ago by scientists
upon whom the AEC must de-
pend for loyal and construc-
tive work in the days ahead.
In either case, however,
the interests of the country
would seem to be well served
by the publication of this re-
markable and frightening ac-
count of what may have been
the greatest crisis in our
time.

I read the book on a plane
going to Tulsa last week and
then bought another copy for
a friend. The young lady who
sold it to me said that she
had refrained from reading
it because it would make her
"unhappy."
I answered that it is bet-
ter to be unhappy than dead.
That advice I freely extend
to all. The book brings home
many profoundly important
lessons which Americans
seem to find difficult to learn.
The major figure in this ac-
count is Dr. Edward Teller,
born and educated in Hun-
gary and an adopted Ameri-
can who should have an hon-
ored place in history.
Teller believed with all the
intensity of his being that
the hydrogen bomb was not
only a practical possibility
but, in the light what the
Soviets might do, a critical,
life-or-death necessity. He
was rebuffed, scoffed at, and
hindered at every side by fel-
low scientists.
Behind the scenes there
was operating against him
the indescribably powerful
influence of Dr. J. Robert Op-
penheimer. But Teller broke
through the bonds of official
It was the alertness of these
nonscientists to the perilous
implications of the neglect of
the hydrogen bomb that
saved the day and that may
well have saved this country
from a disaster too terrible
to contemplate.
Strauss' membership on the
AEC was terminated in 1950,
but with the inauguration of
President Eisenhower he was
brought into official life
again, first as assistant to the
President on atomic matters
and later as chairman of the
AEC.
There can be no question
about the decisive part he
played not only in furthering
the development of the hy-
drogen bomb, but in conclud-
ing the Oppenheimer case
with a clear-cut decision.

To have taken the course
that Strauss suggested,
which was, according to Shep-
ley and Blair and confirmed
by Strauss, to buy the manu-
script of "The Hydrogen
Bomb" and lock it in a safe
for 26 years, would have been
the height of folly. In the
first place, if Shepley and
Blair had not published the
account, many others would
have done so, because there
is little contained therein that
many good reporters could
not have assembled.
More important, however,
is the fact that all this deplor-
able story should be known
to an American public too
complacent for its own safe-
ty. Above all, that the Amer-
ican public should be informed
over and over that, without
its Congress, this weapon of
defense and retaliation would
have been denied us.
