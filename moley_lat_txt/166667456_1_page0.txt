The Hon, Sam Rayburn is
the most cautious statesman
I have ever known. That dis-
tinction I confer without res-
ervations. I believe I shall
find few who disagree.
It may well be that this
quality has a great deal to
do with two other Rayburn
distinctions with which no
one can disagree. He has
served longer in the House
than any other member and
has held the Speaker's gavel
more years than any other
person in history.
Rayburn's caution is em-
bedded in the very fiber of his
being. It is portrayed in every
gesture, in every tone of his
voice. He may say with com-
plete assurance and in a quite
audible voice: "I believe in
letting everyone know just
where I stand." Then he will
peer carefully to the left, to
the right, and behind. If the
coast is clear, he will proceed.
I thought of this habit of
his when I read an incompa-
rable sentence from his male-
diction over the nonfeasance
and malfeasance of the 83rd
Congress on the last day of
the session:
"If I were addicted to mak-
ing predictions (this is always
an excellent way to begin
making a prediction. It ar-
rests attention by suggesting
that a lifetime habit of re-
straint is about to be aban-
doned. The listener is alerted
to news of a sensational char-
acter. But the speaker has
also left for himself a wide
avenue of escape.) I would
say that if the Eisenhower
administration and the Re-
publican Party continue on
the course they have adopted
(here is another avenue of
escape. Because under stern
warnings the Eisenhower ad-
ministration and Republican
Party may change their
course.), the reaction of the
people of this country (at this
moment the terrible danger
of making a prediction be-
comes apparent to the speak-
er. The spirit of caution
which has served so well in
a score of elections to Con-
gress pulls at the coattails of
the Rayburn consciousness
and bids him duck) will be
dangerous.
Somebody will be hurt if
things go as they have gone.
But the identity of the victim
is undetermined.
The long speech which fol-
lows is in effect intended as a
keynote for his party. But
like all keynotes, it is tenta-
tive and exploratory. For no
one knows what the vital is-
sues will be. The preferences
of the voters will determine
them later. At this moment a
professional like Rayburn be-
lieves in feeling his way.
And so throughout the dis-
course he adopts the safest
course possible.
He charges the administra-
tion and the Republican Con-
gress with inconsistency.
They have, he says, promised
many things, but they have
done nothing about Yalta and
so forth.
They have talked big and
have not acted. They have
promised to stabilize prices,
but they have not done so.
Instead, they have resorted
to manipulation by the Fed-
eral Reserve to keep prices
up.
They have promised to bal-
ance the budget, but they
have continued to run def-
icits. And finally and most
important, they promised 90%
or 100% support for farm
prices and have adopted a
flexible system.
A professional like Ray-
burn knows that consistency
in politics is difficult to find.
In fact, the normal in politics
is inconsistency. And no voter
is ever moved by the incon-
sistency of the people he
elects. He is moved by far
more vital considerations.
But the Democratic leader
was not making a speech to
destroy Republicans. He was
offering voters a wide selec-
tion from a carefully selected
menu. Then, after there is
some indication of what they
like, the real campaign can
begin. It is early yet to pre-
dict, as Rayburn himself
might say,
