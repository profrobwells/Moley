BENDER AND THE STATE OF OHIO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There seems to be crop-
ping up in all stories about
political prospects in the
various States the predic-
tion that. George Bender,
Republican, has an "edge"
over-Thomas A. Burke,
Democrat, in the contest
for the Senate seat vacated
by the death of Taft.
There must be some rea-
son for this bit of cheer for
Republicans amid the gloom
of what seems to be des-
cending night. I made some
inquiries about it when I
was in Ohio 10 days ago and
have made further inquiries
since.
The reason, it made clear
to me, rests upon a num-
ber of conditions and cir-
cumstances.
First. it is a tradition and
a habit of Ohio Republicans
to be loyal to their party's
candidates. No State had
more cause to sulk in 1952
because of the convention
defeat of its idol, Bob Taft.
But led by Taft himself and
the ever-steadfast Republi-
can John Bricker, the State
whipped itself behind the
Eisenhower ticket and won
all along the line.
A second reason this year
for the vitality of Republi-
canism is the shadow of
Taft. He is revered in death
even more than he was sup-
ported in life. His loss
makes people in the State
realize, as in fact they real-
ize in Congress and over the
nation, what a void his
death created.
Things, they say, would
be different if he had been
there to advise a greenhorn
in the White House. In this
campaign references to the
late Senator are heard with
fervent but awesome re-
spect. Even Democrats can-
not talk back to the spirit
of greatness.
A third factor in the ap-
parent strength of Bender
is the press support, for a
very large proportion of the
major newspapers of the
State are supporting Bend-
er.
A fourth factor is George
Bender himself. I have
heard Bender criticized over
a period of 30 years for
faults and sins and short-
comings. But somehow he
has remained during all that
time a major figure in Ohio
politics. A man must have
something substantial to
weather what Bender has
been through.
In politics he is a pro of
pros. Politics has been the
breath of his life every hour
of every day. He has taken
defeat and victory with im-
perturbable self-assurance.
There is one thing about
Bender that over the years
has made him thousands of
friends: he has never tried
to be anybody but himself.
This trait, as I have seen
them come and go, has al-
most invariably been true
of Ohio statesmen or, if you
will, politicians.
Slight elevations of the
nose may greet their name
in some circles in New York
and Washington. That was
true of mentions of Taft be-
fore 1952. It is true with
Bricker now. But press the
people who hold those opin-
ions and they take refuge
in the usual metropolitan
cliches such as "isolation-
ist." There is no substance
in the critics.
Bender's plain virtues
have been admirably pro-
jected in a television series
prepared by Paul Manning
as a professional service.
There is portrayed in ample
variety the Bender of every-
day life. These portrayals
in my judgment are worth
a thousand speeches.
Finally. Bender is being
served well by the labor
bosses. They are out there
with their exaggerations,
their dreary predictions,
and their well-filled treas-
ury. All this may drive
many, many thousands of
their card-carrying mem-
bers to vote for the people
the bosses oppose, just as
they did for Taft in 1950.
I make no predictions in
this cloudy year, but as of
now Bender seems to be do-
ing well.
