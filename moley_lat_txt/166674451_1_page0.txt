Ford Foundation Plans
to Sell Its Motor Stock
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It may be a mere coincl-
dence, but it is worthy of
note that the statement in
London of Henry. Ford II that
his family plans to sell the
stock in the Ford Motor Co.
which is held by the Ford
Foundation has followed
closely after the criticisms
voiced before the Reece com-
mittee of the House about
the possible permanent con-
trol of the foundation by the
members of the family.
If this be true, the labors
of the Reece committee, de-
spite drastic criticism of its
activities, are bearing fruit.
The president of the great
company founded by Henry
Ford said that the reports of
pending public sales of shares
in the company are "pretty
reliable." He added that the
shares to be sold are now
among the assets of the Ford
Foundation.
¥
The Ford Motor Co., he
pointed out, is planning no
sale of stock. The United
Press reports in the same
story that the Ford Founda-
tion's holdings are about
3,000,000 shares of Class A
nonvoting stock, while the en-
tire 172,000 shares of Class B
voting stock are held by mem-
bers of the family, which
gives them complete control
of the Ford Motor Co.
It is, I believe, a fair state-
ment that the creation of the
foundation with such a huge
holding of the nonvoting
stock made it unnecessary un-
der the law to liquidate a
large part of the company
stock to pay death taxes.
This might not have endan-
gered the control of the com-
pany by the Ford family, but
It would have resulted in
vesting ownership of an enor-
mous amount of the stock in
a great many people who
might conceivably have been
unfriendly to the manage-
ment of the company.

As a result of vesting this
In the foundation, it could be
assumed that the stock would
be in friendly hands, since
the board of the foundation
would include members of
the family.
However, it would be in-
evitable that the foundation,
whose concerns should be
largely devoted to "scientific,
educational and charitable
purposes," would also be some-
what diverted in its interests
by the concerns of the com-
pany.
According to testimony by
H. Rowan Gaither Jr. before
the Cox Committee on Tax-
Exempt Foundations in 1952,
Henry Ford II wanted a com-
plete separation between the
company and the foundation
and also he wanted "at the
appropriate time, preferably
at an early time," to termi-
nate "any semblance of con-
trol by the. Ford family" of
the foundation.
*
The resources thus trans-
ferred to the foundation were,
according to Gaither, in 1948
worth about $300,000,000.
Gaither, who organized the
plans for the foundation at
that time, summoned to his
aid a number of individuals
representing various scientific
and academic fields of inter-
est, including apparently two
social scientists and one edu-
cator.
The educator died and ap-
parently the two social scien-
tists completely won over
Gaither and the trustees of
the foundation to a program
practically limited to social
science. Five divisions of ac-
tivity were indicated which
might be described as interna-
tional, polítical, economic,
educational and psychological.
My use of the word "political"
is in the classical sense, i.e.,
studies of government, pub-
lic and private rights, etc,
*
It is easy to see that this
program can and in fact has
plunged the foundation into
highly controversial fields,
and the early presidency of
the foundation of such an
active participant in political
affairs as Paul Hoffman ac-
centuated this.
The expenditure of such
Immense funds in activities
which may involve highly de-
batable people and purposes
raised a real issue for the
Ford family.
They might well have felt
that they must either make
automobiles or reform the
world. To do both would be
too much even for so highly
gifted a family as this one.
