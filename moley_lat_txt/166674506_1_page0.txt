The decisive victory of Gov.
Allan Shivers in the recent
runoff primary in Texas was
due to a movement and a
trend which had its origins
long before.
It was not due, as some
commentators have asserted,
to the popularity of President
Eisenhower and the Eisen-
hower policies. It is neces-
sary to say this without in
any way deprecating the
President's undoubted popu-
larity over the country or his
substantial achievement in
getting his program through
Congress.
Shivers won decisively be-
cause conservative elements
are in control of the Demo-
cratic Party in Texas, and aft-
er the indecisive vote in the
first primary they were
aroused to action.
Ten years ago a group of
conservative Democrats at-
tempted to capture control of
the delegation to the Demo-
cratic convention which
nominated Roosevelt for a
fourth term. They were beat-
en by the forces which were
supporting and were support-
ed by the New Deal adminis-
tration in Washington.
Some of the people who
were in that losing fight re-
alized that a political party
cannot be captured by frontal
assault. It must be captured
by patient, quiet labor at the
precinct level. And so a num-
ber of serious and conserva-
tive Democrats went to work
at the grass roots. They nev-
er underestimated the job.
The ground in which they
worked, however, was favor-
able to the acceptance of a
conservative program. Pow-
erful newspapers in the State
had for a long time been op-
posed to the leftist policies of
the Roosevelt and Truman
administration and in 1952
strongly supported both Ei-
senhower and Shivers. This
time they went all out again.
It took a long time to
achieve positive results, but
the educational and organiza-
tional work finally paid out
in the precinct, county, and
State Democratic conventions
in 1952.
Enough people turned out
at the precinct level and at
the grass roots to win con-
servative control of the Dem-
ocratic Party. Allan Shivers,
who became Governor in
1949, became the accepted
candidate and leader of the
conservative movement.
It should be made clear
that neither Shivers nor any
of the group that had labored
to bring about the 1952 result
had any intention of joining
the Republican Party.
They remained Democrats
and claimed that the Texas
Democratic Party would re-
tain full freedom to ally it-
self with any candidate or
cause that it chose, regardless
of the action of a national
Democratic convention or
committee.
It was quite natural, when
Candidate Stevenson allied
himself with the left wing of
the Democratic Party in 1952,
that Texas conservatives, in-
cluding Gov. Shivers, sup-
ported Eisenhower.
As is the case so often
when a group of this sort has
won a victory, vigilance was
relaxed and some of the Shiv-
ers followers assumed that
he would win with ease in
the July primary.
However, when that pri-
mary came off with almost a
tie vote between Shivers and
his opponent, Ralph W. Yar-
borough, the conservatives
bestirred themselves and in-
creased the vote by more than
100,000. Most of the vote went
to Shivers.
In the final campaign Shiv-
ers and his supporters made
the most of the fact that the
CIO had entered the cam-
paign in force and with plen-
ty of means.
The conservatives called
upon the people to repudiate
this invasion of the State by
outside labor "bosses." The
reaction of the voters was
much like that of the voters
in Ohio in 1950 when Taft
was re-elected Senator.
Labor opposition became
an asset. Another appeal that
won votes was Shivers' obvi-
ous sincerity when he pledged
himself to principles rather
than party labels.
In any event, the result
proved once more that if the
vote can be got out, the con-
servative rather than the
radical side has the advan-
tage.
My information is that the
support of Eisenhower by
Shivers and the implication,
at least, that the President
favored him to win did not
help him. It cost him a good
many votes. For, despite the
fact that Eisenhower carried
the State in 1952 and strong-
ly supported the tidelands
legislation, his popularity in
the Lone Star State has
slipped. His farm policies and
his administration's partici-
pation in the school segrega-
tion case have lost him a
good deal of favor.
The Shivers victory was a
victory for conservative gov-
ernment.
