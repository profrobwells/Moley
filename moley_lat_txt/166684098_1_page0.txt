RAYMOND MOLEY:
Bureaucrats Still Vie
for Government Power
During the 1954 session
of Congress, a violent dispute
arose concerning the proposal
to build a big storage dam at
Echo Park, which is in the
Dinosaur National Monument
in Utah and Colorado.
Friends and lovers of the
national parks made strenuous
objections.
The administration, however,
relying upon figures supplied
by experts in the Bureau of
Reclamation, justified the
invasion of the Dinosaur
Monument on the ground that
to build the dam at any one
of several other suggested
sites would result in great loss
of water by evaporation.
Elaborate calculations were
presented.
*
These calculations were
fiercely contested. The highly
respected Gen. U. S. Grant
III, who served with distinction
as an Army engineer for many
years, opposed the bureau's
figures.
Grant pointed out in his
testimony before a House
committee last January that
the bureau claimed in 1950
that one of the proposed
substitutes would involve a
loss of 350,000 acre-feet of
water annually.
Grant challenged this in
1950 and the bureau revised
its figures to somewhere between
100,000 and 200,000 acre-feet.
This was a whale of a mistake.
But more blundering was to
come.
Ralph A. Tudor, Under-secretary
of the Interior, also testified
in January.
The bureau supplied him with
a figure of 45,000 acre-feet
loss if the dam were erected
at still another site.
This was also contested, and
the unfortunate Tudor was
subjected to the humiliating
experience in May of having
to admit that the January
figures were wrong and that
the loss would only be 25,000
acre-feet.
*
He admitted that he had
directed the mistaken scientists
to take pencils and slide rules
in hand and figure again.
Tudor, who retired from the
government some months ago,
now tells, in an article in the
Saturday Evening Post, a lot
about his experiences with the
bureaucracy.
He fails to tell the evaporation
story, perhaps because he does
not want to embarrass the
efforts of Secretary McKay to
push through the Echo Park
Dam in the next session. But
what he does tell is shocking.
The department, he says, was
infested with "a badly disorganized,
swollen bureaucracy . . . it
was a loose confederation of
duchies," or bureaus, many
of them at war with one another
or with bureaus in other departments
. . . and control from the
top was so undermined that
some bureaus were virtually
ignoring the secretariat's existence."
This bureaucracy was, Tudor
continues, constantly revealing
incompetence shrouded by its
elaborate figures and estimates.
He found that a hydroelectric
power plant in Alaska, which
they had estimated to cost
$22,000,000, would actually
cost $30,000,000.
But more amazing still, he
found that, while $18,000,000
had been spent on the plant,
the bureaucracy had omitted
getting water rights first. They
belonged to the city of Anchorage.
On another occasion, the
State of Arizona was seeking
to buy certain transmission
lines from the Federal government.
*
Tudor was favorable to this
because it would further the
administration's partnership
policy. But the bureaucrats,
still apparently holding to the
Ickes policy of rule or ruin,
tried to discourage the sale by
estimating the loss to the
Federal government at $80,000,000.
Tudor "knew that this was
wrong," and, as in the evaporation
case, ordered more calculation.
The bureaucrats came up with
$50,000,000. Tudor knew that
this was wrong, too. Later, the
bureaucrats cut down to $25,000,000.
Note that this could happen
to Tudor, who was a highly
skilled engineer. What would
happen to just an ordinary
businessman in such dealings
with the tricks of a bureaucracy?
The serious thing is that the
bureaucrats are still there
spending taxpayers' money,
while Tudor is back in private
life. For in all the months
Tudor was there, the new
administration was able to get
rid of only 4000 out of 56,000
holdovers.
*
Tudor says further that "we,"
meaning McKay and himself,
tried to get permission from
the Civil Service Commission
to bring in "just 1%" or 560
people of their own choice.
The Civil Service Commission
allowed them only 92. This
represents the policy, shown
in many other instances, of
President Eisenhower's own
Civil Service chairman.
As I have noted on many
occasions before, the Eisenhower
administration did not take
over the Truman-Roosevelt
bureaucracy. The bureaucracy
took over the Eisenhower
administration.
