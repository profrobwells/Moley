Businessmen who pay
plenty of the firm's money
and lots of what the govern-
ment would otherwise get in
taxes on various forecasters
demand a hard task of a po-
litical commentator.
It is expected that the fore-
casters will produce, by nice
statistical arrangements and
deductions, a prediction of
what will happen in the elec-
tion come this November. It
is no credit to many such
commentators that they seek
to comply.
★
They do so at the expense
of common sense and, un-
fortunately in some cases, at
a high price in self-respect.
For there is only one thing
that a good many years of
writing on political subjects
permits me to say for sure:
Nobody can tell much about
what will happen. And I, for
one, shall not attempt the
shady job of fooling people.
To illustrate what I mean
I take a lesson from the vari-
ous interpretations of the
Maine election. Surely it
ought to be easier to inter-
pret something that has hap-
pened than to determine in
advance a lot of things that
haven't happened. And it
should be easier to find out
what happened in a relatively
stable State like Maine than
in the 17 other States, some
of which are as capricious as
a March wind.

My sampling of interpreta-
tions was, as they say, na-
tionwide. That is, I have
traveled from Los Angeles
to the East Side of New York
since the Maine election. I
have examined the comments
in various papers over that
stretch and have talked with
a number of people.
In Chicago I was told that,
while the election of a Demo-
cratic Governor in Maine can
be discounted because of the
unpopularity of the incum-
bent Republican Governor,
the drop in the majorities of
Mrs. Smith and the incum-
bent Republican Congress-
men is ominous.
It means, they said in Chi-
cago, that practical and tough-
minded Maine voters are fed
up with the globalism of
Mrs. Smith and at least one
or two of the Congressmen.
Therefore, Republicans
stayed home in large num-
bers, and some of those who
did not stay home decided
to vote a protest against in-
ternationalism.
★
Then there was the line
taken by a commentator who
is pretty global himself.
Walter Lippmann says that
the vote means that the great
independent vote is not fa-
vorable to the Republican
Party, while it is still enthu-
siastic about the President.
The deduction of Mr. Lipp-
man is that Republican candi-
dates must become so much
like Democratic candidates
that the great mass of inde-
pendent voters will move in-
to that party.
There is no real rational
reason why people who have
been voting Democratic be-
cause they liked Democratic
policies should move over into
the Republican Party. But
that was the position taken
by this same commentator be-
fore the Republican conven-
tion in 1952, and his deduc-
tion was that Taft should be
defeated at all costs.
There are variations on
these guesses which need not
be outlined here. They all
simply mean that commenta-
tors, being human, interpret
an omen in line with their
prejudices.
★
Two comments that I en-
countered, however, made
sense. One was by Kyle Palm-
er, political editor of the Los
Angeles Times. He said that
Los Angeles is a long way
from Maine, that September
is a long way from November,
and that until all the figures
are examined and the voters
and nonvoters identified, any-
one would be a fool to in-
terpret any meaning into the
Maine result.
Another bit of common
sense was written into an edi-
torial in the Cleveland Plain
Dealer. The author of that
editorial merely quoted the
old version of the still older
aphorism, "As Maine goes so
goes Maine."
