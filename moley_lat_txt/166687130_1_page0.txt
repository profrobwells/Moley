ADLAI'S
LESSON
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last July while I was in
the Northwest I noted in a
column the strange educa-
tion of Adlai Stevenson in
the mysteries of hydroelec-
tric power. He said he
"wanted to learn something
about both sides of the
power question."
Stevenson wended his
way to Oregon, and for
such impartial instruction
he sat at the feet of Rich-
ard L. Neuberger, who is
a candidate for the Senate
seat now occupied by the
able Guy Cordon.
The course of instruction
must have been pleasantly
relaxing because there were
during that week pictures
in Oregon papers — Adlai
fishing, crossing streams on
logs, and sitting in luxur-
ious ease with nary a book
in sight.
The said Richard L. Neu-
berger is one of the most
ardent and demagogic ex-
ploiters of the power issue
in modern times. Proof of
that is that in 1950 he complained bitterly in the left-
wing Nation that Wayne
Morse was a backsliding
liberal and an opportunist
who submitted to "a marriage of convenience" with
reactionaries and isolation-
ists.
★
Among other sins charged
to Morse was that he had
"bartered a liberal voice in
Washington for political
security at home." But apparently the prodigal son
has returned, for Morse and
Neuberger are fighting
shoulder to shoulder against
an imaginary "power trust."
This is the sort of fountain to which Adlai Steven-
son repaired for refresh-
ment on the power issue.
And during the past week
the instruction seems to
have borne fruit in a speech
by the titular head of the
Democrats in Albuquerque
which in sheer demagog-
uery would make his instructor Neuberger proud.
Speaking of the Columbia
River Basin, Stevenson
charged that "the greatest
remaining power site in the
United States, Hell's Canyon, has been abandoned to
a utility whose plans for
development contemplate
using little more than half
the potential."
★
There are three gross
misstatements in that short
passage. First, Hell's Canyon is not the greatest remaining power site in the
United States. Stevenson is
confusing the height of the
dam with the site.
There are plenty of advantageous sites on the
Snake River itself farther
downstream, as well as on
the Salmon River, which
flows into the Snake below
Hell's Canyon. It would be
possible to build a dam as
high as the one planned by
the Truman administration
in several sites, providing
the Congress wanted to
throw money away on
mere height. The way of
economy is to build lower
dams and to use the water
over and over.
Second, the administration has not "abandoned"
the Hell's Canyon project
to a utility. Congress refused to act upon the Federal project when it was
under Democratic control
and when Truman was
President.
The Eisenhower administration withdrew its objections so that the Idaho
Power Co. might submit its
case to the Federal Power
Commission. That is where
the matter now rests.
★
Third, it is simply untrue that the utility would
use "little more than half"
the potential. The difference, as shown by many
witnesses not employed by
the private company, would
be about 10%.
Stevenson turns to the
Niagara and says that "bills
were introduced to give
away Niagara Falls to five
private power companies."
This, too, is a gross mis-
statement.
The administration was
not responsible for the Miller bill, which would have
permitted private development of a small fraction,
not all, of Niagara Falls.
Finally, it should be apparent to any fair-minded
person that to permit a private power company to develop a public resource is
merely to permit that company to make available the
fruits of that resource to
the people themselves, under strict government regulation of rates.
