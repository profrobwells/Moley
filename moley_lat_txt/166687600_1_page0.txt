FACTS ON COL. HOUSE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It is neither the purpose
of this piece nor its import
to quarrel with anything
that Westbrook Pegler has
written.

He has written a great
many things that needed to
be written and with which
I would agree. He is en-
titled to his own opinion of
the mumbo-jumbo which
Col. E. M. House wrote in
his novel, "Philip Dru; Ad-
ministrator." My purpose
here is merely to set
straight a few historical
facts about House, F.D.R.,
Ickes and others.

Pegler notes that Ickes
in his no longer "secret"
diary wrote that in October,
1933, F.D.R. sent House
over to see him and that
House told him that he,
House, had recommended
Cordell Hull to Roosevelt
for Secretary of State. On
this House was either pull-
ing the Ickesian leg or, as
was true of most of the
diary, the Ickes "facts"
were wrong.

These are the facts on the
subject, most of which I
published 15 years ago in
my book, "After Seven
Years."

House in 1933 was 75
years old. He was feeble be-
yond his years. He was idle,
garrulous, nosey and vain.
If he had ever possessed
good judgment and Wood-
row Wilson seemed to think
so, he had lost it over the
years. He wrote many let-
ters to F.D.R. during the
campaign in 1932 and dur-
ing the months after. F.D.R.
gave them to me to read.
He remarked as he did so:
"Col. 'Mouse' is right about
a third of the time."

According to my book,
(which was based upon my
personal journal), House
came to F.D.R.'s New York
house on 65th St. on Nov. 9,
1932, the day after election.
My comment on that visit
was that the colonel "at
luncheon played the rabbit's
foot to the new Uncle Re-
mus." He said to the Presi-
dent-elect: "Some of your
speeches were so good that
they sounded like Woodrow
Wilson's."

On that same day in
F.D.R.'s living room alone
with the President-elect
and me House suggested
that Robert W. Bingham
would be a good choice for
Secretary of State.

On Dec. 23 I had a long
talk with F.D.R. about
Cabinet appointments in
his study in Albany. I wrote
this in my book about what
took place with reference
to the State Department.

"He talked desultorily of
the qualifications of Sens.
Key Pittman, Cordell Hull,
and Joe Robinson; of New-
ton Baker, Owen Young,
Bernie Baruch and Robert
W. Bingham of Louisville.
It was clear he had come
to no final decision. But
there were indications that
he had already eliminated
most of these men from se-
rious consideration.

"Baruch could be better
used elsewhere, he felt. Joe
Robinson was needed as
Senate leader. Robinson's
supreme desire was a court
appointment, in any case.
Baker simply wouldn't do.
Pittman he liked, but Pitt-
man would emerge as chair-
man of the Committee on
Foreign Relations in the
Senate if Swanson should
come into the Cabinet. As
such, his power and influ-
ence could be as great as
that of the Secretary of
State.

"There remained Bing-
ham, Young and Hull. Of
Bingham, Roosevelt frankly
said that he knew little or
nothing except the facts
that Bingham was publish-
er of the Louisville Courier-
Journal, that he had con-
tributed substantially to
the campaign fund, and that
Col. 'Mouse'-a pet name
for old House-had repeat-
edly recommended him. It
seemed that Bingham's very
obscurity, so far as nation-
al politics were concerned,
intrigued him. He spoke
laughingly of the 'stiff dose
for the international bank-
ers' Bingham's appointment
would be."

I remarked that there
were others besides interna-
tional bankers who would
be shocked, and that I
would be among them.
F. D. R. never mentioned
Bingham again in that con-
nection. It was Louis Howe
and F. D. R. himself, not
House, who decided upon
Hull.

It is perhaps irrelevant
that House and Bingham
were friendly. Some weeks
after that, in an automobile
riding from Warm Springs
to Atlanta, Bingham told
me that it was Baruch who
had turned the mind of Wil-
son against House. This was
intended, of course, to turn
me against Baruch. Instead,
considering what I knew of
the judgment of House, I
was only sorry that Baruch
had waited so long to rid
the Wilson household of Col.
"Mouse."

I am sorry to dispel any
illusions about the signifi-
cance of House and his
book, "Philip Dru." But he
had as much influence on
F. D. R. and his policies as
the ghost of Samuel Pepys.
