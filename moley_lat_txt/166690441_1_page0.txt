SENATE
WIVES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While our Senators toss
and roll in the sea of se-
mantics into which their
pursuit of McCarthy has
launched them, let us turn
to another side of Sena-
torial life. For the wives of
the Senators have their re-
sponsibilities, and their
days are as full of things as
those of their distinguished
husbands.
Witness the week's do-
ings of Mrs. Prescott Bush
of Connecticut, written aft-
er the fashion of a certain
famous column, "My Day,"
and published in the Green-
wich Time, of Greenwich,
Ct.

The concerns of this esti-
mable lady range over all
the vast issues of our na-
tional life, international re-
lations, bipartisanship, mili-
tary affairs and McCarthy.
Monday there was a re-
ception for Yoshida: "Al-
though smaller than Mr.
Churchill, he has the same
general roundness."
Tuesday was tragic so far
as Anglo-American rela-
tions were concerned. The
Senator's wife borrowed a
dress and bought a hat to
appear before the Queen
Mother at the British Em-
bassy.
She found out that gloves
would be worn when shak-
ing hands with the visitor,
but noted that Mrs. Eisen-
hower always takes her
gloves off, so "one takes
one's right hand glove off,
too."
All this was in vain be-
cause in attempting to
avoid the crush at six to en-
joy the calm at seven, they
found that the Queen had
met the crush at six to
avoid the calm at seven.
The royal bird had flown.

But "Pres really has the
most heavenly disposition
as not once did he say, 'Dot-
ty, how could you have
been so careless.'"
Indeed, it is the wife who
makes an occasional mis-
take who brings out the
best in a man. The perfect
wife never discovers the
heavenly in her mate.
The military in these
days of cold war must not
be neglected.
There was a luncheon
given by Gen. and Mrs.
Sheppherd at the Army and
Navy Club for the sculptor
who created the Iwo Jima
Marine Memorial, "to which
I was taken by Sam Meek
of Greenwich. Sam and
Gene Tunney are both on
the board of directors of the
War Memorial Foundation,
so it was great fun to go
out with them and their
darling wives to this
occasion."

On Friday a dainty blow
was struck for bipartisan-
ship, the Army, and inter-
national comity.
"Betty" Fulbright took
Mrs. Bush to a luncheon
for Mrs. Aso, daughter of
Yoshida:
"One thing she (Mrs. Aso)
said interested me particu-
larly, and that was that the
industrious wives of the oc-
cupation forces had done
so much to correct the
wrong impression of Ameri-
ca given by the movies, and
that she thought having
them there had done much
toward increasing the re-
spect of the Japanese for
our country. Army wives, I
congratulate you. America
needs ambassadors of good-
will."
Inevitably McCarthy
must come up, but gently
and with a touch of sadness.

Mrs. Bush writes about
this censure session: "There
is a certain suspicion and
caution amongst the wives
in the gallery which never
existed before, some not
even speaking to others. I
do hope by the time Janu-
ary comes along all this
will have blown over, or
our Senate ladies' days will
be ruined."
There it is. Americans
may regret that the Senate,
occasionally referred to by
Senators as the "gr-r-r-reat-
est deliberative body in the
wor-r-rld" has gotten itself
into a mess from which it
cannot extricate itself with-
out loss of dignity and pub-
lic confidence.
But Mrs. Bush has
pointed an ungloved finger
at a still greater tragedy.
But, as Mrs. Bush says,
maybe it will "blow over."
One might ask, "blow over"
what?
