RAYMOND MOLEY:
Issue of McCarthy Is
Unchanged by Censure
From what I have been
able to learn from newspa-
pers and personal contacts,
there is as much disappoint-
ment over the Watkins re-
port among McCarthy's ene-
mies as among his friends.
My own conclusion is that
the status of McCarthy will
remain about the same, what-
ever the Senate may decide
about the Watkins recom-
mendations.
"Censure" is a word with
fairly serious meaning in the
traditions and law of the Sen-
ate, but to the man on the
street it means merely a re-
proof administered for an of-
fense that merits no more
serious punishment.
*
The friends of McCarthy
can say with a good deal of
assurance that the fact that
many charges, some of which
seemed to be more serious
than the ones which the com-
mittee singled out, have been
wiped off the slate is a net
gain for the Senator from
Wisconsin. For example, a
good many people felt that
the Lustron fee was a very
serious matter if true. The
committee has now declared
it was "not susceptible of
proof in this forum."
There are many people,
including the President of
the United States, who be-
lieve that unrestricted access
by subordinate officers and
employees of the government
to members of Congress is
bad. In fact, it will be be-
lieved by a great many that
such unauthorized access was
the reason selected by Presi-
dent Truman for removing
Gen. MacArthur. The Wat-
kins committee has now left
that door wide open.
*
The committee uses the
word "contumacious" to de-
scribe McCarthy's attitude to-
ward a Senate committee in
the previous Congress.
Aside from the confusion
that many people will en-
counter in understanding this
word which, according to
Black's Law Dictionary "is
chiefly used in ecclesiastical
law," there will be the natu-
ral question why the commit-
tee toward which McCarthy
was "contumacious" failed to
seek censure at the time. It
was a Democratic committee
in a Democratic Senate.
The charge that McCarthy's
treatment of Gen. Zwicker
was "reprehensible" comes
down to what sort of lan-
guage toward a witness
should be censured.
There are two sorts of at-
tacks, one of which can be
shrugged off by most men in
public life. There is the call-
ing of names which imply
ridicule, impropriety, bad
judgment, or insincerity. But
there are also attacks which
cut to the heart of any man
sensitive of his honor and in-
tegrity. The second is serious.
The first is undesirable.
*
An example of the second
appeared in the press at the
very moment when the Wat-
kins report hit the headlines.
Sen. Henry Jackson, accord-
ing to the Associated Press,
said that during the first 18
months of Charles E. Wil-
son's term as Defense Secre-
tary, defense contracts award-
ed to General Motors went
up, while those signed by all
other automakers shrunk.
And then Jackson went on
to say:
"... I can only conclude
that the concentration of
these contracts in General
Motors must reflect a settled
procurement policy of the De-
fense Department under Sec-
retary Wilson."
*
This is substantially a
charge of either favoritism or
corruption. It is an imputa-
tion staining the integrity of
the boss of all the generals, a
man who is loyally serving
his country. This sort of
thing has been done over and
over by demagogues in the
Senate in their attacks on the
power policies of the admin-
istration. Not once, but dozens
of times Senators have ac-
cused the President and Sec-
retary McKay of the Interior
Department of "selling out"
to the "power trust."
When the Senate after elec-
tion takes up the matter of
what is proper Senatorial con-
duct, let it give a day or two
to the matter of the limits
of privileged abuse.
But the fact that reckless
talk is common in Senate cir-
cles should not blind even the
greatest admirers of Mc-
Carthy to the fact that he
might well have served his
cause better had he been
more careful in his attacks.
For he has embarrassed even
his best friends at times. I
hope that I am not saying
something too trite or im-
probable when I say that
maybe, after all, this reproof
will help to create a more re-
strained and effective Mc-
Carthy.
