RAYMOND MOLEY:
Is Sen. Joe McCarthy
Really a Conservative?
The jargon employed in
current political discussion
is full of such cliches as "Old
Guard," "Moderate Progres-
sive," "Reactionary," "Mc-
Carthyism," and, very re-
cently, even "Knowland-
ism," and "Nixonism."
There is also a good deal
of nonsense talked and writ-
ten about "remaking" the
Republican Party or the
Democratic Party.
Most of this is the stuff
conjured up as a substitute
for serious discussion by
people too busy or lazy to
dig for facts. For if those
who resort to this sort of
chatter were asked for spec-
ifications, there would be no
firm definitions and no ac-
count of ways and means.
I have before me a docu-
ment which is in sharp con-
trast to such political gib-
berish. It is a serious effort
to determine so far as pos-
sible the exact ideological
ranking of members of Con-
gress, based upon their re-
corded votes.
Such a method is the only
way to arrive at a charac-
terization of a person's po-
litical and economic philos-
ophy.
★
Such a characterization
is not determined by how a
person describes himself,
nor is it fixed by what his
friends or his enemies call
him.
He makes his record, vote
by vote, and that record
when completed tells where
he falls in the political spec-
trum from red to violet.
This study was laborious-
ly compiled by a group
which is interested in the
search for truth as an end
in itself. Its members wish
to remain anonymous. They
ask no credit or acclaim.
Many common claims and
assumptions in current po-
litical discussion can be de-
molished by the use of this
valuable material, and I
shall deal with them in sub-
sequent articles. Today,
however, I shall be content
to examine only one.
This is the assumption
that Sen. McCarthy is an
extreme conservative and
that he can be the center
or head of a new third par-
ty. His enemies would call
this a Fascist party, and
they quake in their slum-
bers with dreams of bloody
purges and gas chambers.
His friends conceive of such
a McCarthy party as a res-
cue party for the republic.
My material ranks the
members of the Senate from
extreme conservative to ex-
treme liberal or radical or
what-you-will. More than
150 votes in the 83rd Con-
gress are used to determine
this classification, and I am
satisfied after examing these
issues and their classifica-
tion that the researchers
have been perceptive and
wise.
★
The startling fact emerges
from this that Sen. Mc-
Carthy is far from being
at the top of the Senate's
conservatives. His rank is
No. 39, almost halfway
down the list from conserva-
tive to liberal.
He occupies, in fact, a
choice place in the group of
partisans which President
Eisenhower calls "Progres-
sive Moderates" or "Mod-
erate Progressives."
In short, over all he might
receive from the President
(I say he might) a scroll
designating him as a dis-
tinguished member of the
middle-of-the-road club.
I suppose that the people
who talk so much about
the Old Guard would say
that the very embodiment
of that dangerous company
of "reactionaries" would be
the top 10 who rank at the
top of this list. And that
the chief of the Old Guard,
or, as some might say, "en-
emy of progress No. 1"
would be the top man.
Well, that Senator is
named Watkins, the neme-
sis of McCarthy, and No. 2
is Sen. Bennett who did a
bit of "nemesing" himself.
Flanders, who started it all,
is more conservative than
McCarthy.
Morse is No. 79, and Ful-
bright is No. 81.
Murray of Montana is the
most liberal.
As my favorite comedian,
George Gobel, would say,
"So, there you are."
