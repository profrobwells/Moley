RAYMOND MOLEY:
Public Power Did Not
Win in Oregon Vote
Those who never look
beyond the political head-
lines persist in believing
that the election of Rich-
ard Neuberger in Oregon
was a popular mandate for
Socialized electric power
and a defeat for Eisenhow-
er's policy toward private
ownership. That is be-
cause very, very few are
interested in more than the
elections of Senators and
Governors.
Let us take a look be-
neath the surface of things
at the reality, because if
the Neuberger election is
really a mandate for his
public-power views and
those of his partner in ho-
kum, Wayne Morse, the
Democratic Party had a
real issue.
Oregon is by preference
and tradition a private-
power State, just as Wash-
ington is a public-power
State.
While its private power
companies live under con-
stant threat by government
and by adherents of public
power, a great majority of
its people are satisfied cus-
tomers of private utilities.
Under the law public
power enters the scene
through a vote of the peo-
ple in any county favoring
the creation of a public-
power district, commonly
called a PUD.
In Oregon every election
on the question of forming
a PUD since 1940 has gone
against public power. In
the election last month
three such referendums
were held.
In the northern part of
Lincoln County on the Ore-
gon coast there was a pro-
posal to have that area,
now served by the Pacific
Power & Light Co., an-
nexed to the Central Lin-
coln PUD. It was defeated,
1586 to 401. But Neuberger
carried the county, 3478-
3449.
In Tillamook County, im-
mediately north of Lincoln
County, a PUD has been
operating for several years
in competition with a pri-
vate company. The PUD
sought authorization at the
polls for a bond issue for
the alleged purpose of ex-
tending its transmission
lines.
Under the proposal sub-
mitted to the voters it
would have been possible
to condemn property of the
private company and to put
it out of business in the
county. The proposal was
beaten, 3694-2535. Cordon
carried the county by a
narrow margin, 3322-3141.
In Union County in the
northeastern part of the
State a PUD which has
existed since 1940 sought
a bond issue of $4,500,000
to buy out a private utility
in the county. This was de-
feated in May, 1953.
It went to the polls again
in August and was again
defeated. The PUD then
apparently decided, since
the voters were not happy
with it, that it would put
the question of whether it
should continue in business
or be dissolved.
The voters last month
dissolved it, 2641-1340.
They also voted for Neu-
berger against Cordon,
3621-2960.
The Democratic candi-
date for Governor against
Gov. Patterson stressed
the power issue, as did the
Democratic candidates for
Congress in the 2nd and
4th Districts. The three Re-
publican candidates were
re-elected.
Sen. Cordon himself has
said since the election that
he was defeated because he
was never in any sense a
politician. This is like a
pitcher released by the
New York Giants saying
that, after all, he never
liked baseball anyhow.
Continuing, Cordon con-
fessed that he was prac-
tically unknown in Mult-
nomah County. That is,
where the votes were that
defeated him. His opponent,
aided by his very attractive
and politically sophisticated
wife, campaigned for a year
or two incessantly.
Cordon, after having de-
termined that he would not
run and therefore having
decided not to bother about
fixing his fences, changed
his mind. He waited until
the adjournment of Con-
gress and tried to make up
for lost time in only two
months.
In the summer I heard
over and over again in
Oregon that voters were be-
ginning to think that Cor-
don didn't want the job. To
give that impression was a
poor way to stimulate their
generous instincts.
When he returned to his
native State, Cordon found
himself, like Enoch Arden,
looking in a window, wit-
nessing the happy cohabita-
tion of Neuberger and the
voters who used to love
him.
It was not the power is-
sue that elected Neuberger.
