The Liberal Party in
New York is essentially the
Americans for Democratic
Action, organized as a legal
State political party. Lead-
ership in the party is pri-
marily ADA. The party's
platform is the nearest
thing we have in the Unit-
ed States to the Labor
Party in Britain.
The Liberal Party orig-
inated when a considerable
number of members of the
old American Labor Party
of New York left that group
because it was permeated
with Communists.
David Dubinsky is easily
the strongest and apparent-
ly the dominant figure in
the party. Adolphe Berle,
once an F.D.R. braintrust-
er, is the nominal chair-
man, while Alec Rose, who
is president of the Hatters'
Union, is the practical op-
erator.

The late Edward J.
Flynn, as boss of the Bronx
and New York Democratic
National Committeeman, al-
ways strongly disapproved
of an alliance between the
Democrats and the Liberal
Party. He reasoned, quite
correctly, that such an alli-
ance would ultimately give
the Liberals a balance of
power and would also alien-
ate the few remaining con-
servative Democrats in
New York State. But since
Flynn passed from the
scene and the Dewey domi-
nation in Albany has pre-
vailed, the Democrats ea-
gerly accept the Liberal
Party endorsement.
Certainly that was true
this year when Averell Har-
riman, after his nomina-
tion as Democratic candi-
date for Governor, went to
the Liberal leaders and ab-
jectly solicited their sup-
port. This they freely gave,
not only to Harriman but to
F.D.R. Jr. and the rest of
the ticket.

Alec Rose, in giving his
blessing to the double nom-
ination, said that it consti-
tuted "a pattern of coali-
tion." Indeed it does, and
an examination of the plat-
forms of the two parties
shows a perfect amalgam of
hypocrisy on one hand and
radicalism on the other.
Thus, in New York a
method has been found to
permit candidates to face
both ways without trying
to tie inconsistency into a
single platform. Faced by a
reporter's question about
his attitude toward the two
platforms, F. D. R. Jr. de-
vised a curious solution. He
said that, while he was run-
ning on the Democratic
platform, he regarded the
Liberal platform as a
"guide." Thus, the ship is
conservative, but the navi-
gator is radical. On State
issues he is a Democrat, but
on national issues he is So-
cialist.

This method is suggested
as a means of relieving Ad-
lai Stevenson of embarrass-
ment in reconciling the two
wings of his party. He and
Chairman Mitchell should
let the conservative Demo-
crats make the Democratic
platform in 1956 and cov-
ertly encourage David Du-
binsky and Alec Rose to
extend their Liberal Party
to the whole United States.
Perhaps Stevenson could
even move some of the
more embarrassing mem-
bers of his current follow-
ing, such as Humphrey of
Minnesota and Jackson of
Washington, into the new
Liberal Party. Indeed, that
might solve the problem of
Morse, too.
