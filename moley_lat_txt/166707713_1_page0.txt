A CAPITAL
PAC?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The air is full of talk
these days about some sort
of organized means to fur-
ther conservative policies
in the Federal government.
Behind this talk is a deep-
seated conviction that in or-
der to establish a balance
of power favoring conserva-
tive policies both parties
must face the threat of an
organization independent of
both. This, it is believed,
will force the Republican
Party to abandon what has
in the past two decades
been called "me too-ism."
One of the methods being
talked about is the creation
of a genuine third party,
not a McCarthy party, but
a party small enough to be
independent and large
enough to make its influ-
ence felt. That party would
be devoted to a broad pro-
gram of progress through
conservative action.

• In talking with a man re-
cently who was seeking ad-
vice on this subject, I made
a suggestion which I wish
to pass on.
In the first place, I have
clearly established to my
own satisfaction that the
balance which shifted con-
trol of the House of Repre-
sentatives was the power of
the political arms of labor.
That power was represent-
ed by large sums of money
contributed by union mem-
bers to such political aux-
iliaries and also by the or-
ganized effort of those agen-
cies to get out the anti-
Republican vote.
It is my judgment, after
careful checking, that 11
seats were switched from
Republican to Democratic
because of the efforts of
those labor arms. Four
more were switched be-
cause of unemployment in
the coal industry. These
can safely be added to the
11. Those 15 switches were
much more than enough to
swing the control
*
Such political power as
was exercised by those la-
bor arms requires a lot of
money, and they make no
bones about having it. It is
"voluntarily" given by un-
ion members. And it is giv-
en "voluntarily" after spe-
cific and pointed requests.
Since the fundamental
laws of economics say that
the product of industry
shall be given to those who
contribute (a) labor and (b)
capital, the money earned
by corporations after taxes
goes for (a) wages and sal-
aries and (b) dividends. The
beneficiaries are (a) work-
ers and (b) stockholders.
In the struggle for the di-
vision of the net profits
these two groups, workers
and stockholders, divide.
What is taken by one is not
paid to the other and vice
versa. Both workers and
stockholders are free to use
their wages and dividends
as they like within, of
course, the limits of the law.

If the Political Action
Committee can receive a
specified sum from each
worker, why should not a
similar political action
group receive donations
from stockholders as such?
Corporations are restrict-
ed by law from direct con-
tributions to political cam-
paigns. But there should be
no reason in law or morals
to prevent stockholders
from making contributions
to an organization which
will contribute money to
candidates who will be like-
ly to protect their rights. In
short, what is wrong about
a nationwide stockholders'
PAC?
I should be interested to
know what people who may
read this article think of
the idea. I may say that the
man to whom I made the
suggestion is very experi-
enced in political activity,
and he said there was some-
thing in the idea.
