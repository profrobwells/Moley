PRISON
PROBE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The circumstances be-
hind the murder of William
Remington would seem to
require more than the of-
ficial reticence about the
case promises.
For while there will be a
grand jury investigation of
the murder itself and an of-
ficial investigation of
charges by the murdered
man's lawyer, there will be
no real probe of prison con-
ditions by outside authority
unless Congress demands
it.
Such an investigation has
already been called for by
Congressman Broyhill of
Virginia.
It always seems to be the
course of events in prison
management to cover up
incompetence until a riot
or a serious crime or a big
jail break takes place.
Meanwhile, most prison
administrations are likely
to keep a tight cover on
their operations, however
inadequate they may be.

Whatever anyone may
think of Remington as a
person or of the crime for
which he was sent to prison,
it is the solemn duty of the
government to assure his
safekeeping from violence,
from within or without the
prison.
This is the first duty of a
peace officer of any kind.
Remington's lawyer,
Richard Green, calls atten-
tion to a series of letters
from Remington which
were highly critical of the
conditions in the prison.
Those letters, Green says,
indicated that certain honor
prisoners exercised
considerable authority over
other prisoners.
There had been serious
friction among prisoners
and several assaults, the let-
ters said.
Remington felt himself to
be in danger and, according
to Green, attempted to get
the news out by means of
letters.

James V. Bennett, direc-
tor of the United States
Bureau of Prisons, in
answer says that all outgo-
ing mail is read in the
prison, and if such charges
as are alleged by Green
were made of gang rule,
mattress-burning, and rob-
beryâ€”there would have
been an investigation.
The three assailants, Ben-
nett says, were not honor
prisoners, but were under
what was called "medium
custody," a less severe form
of restraint than is accord-
ed to some, but not so free
as for those who are under
"minimum custody."
The three were assigned
to squad rooms in the same
part of the prison as Rem-
ington, and while a guard
assigned to that section was
on another floor they could
and apparently did get ac-
cess to the murdered man.
*
Presumably, an investiga-
tion will bring forth the old
story that it is not easy to
employ reliable and ef-
ficient people as guards for
the pay usually allowed for
that service. It is not a
pleasant occupation and it
is not well paid.
It should, however, be
unnecessary to supplement
this deficiency by too much
dependence upon self-disci-
pline among prisoners, and
it seems unlikely that this
shortcoming alone resulted
in that act of violence.
