BUSINESS CARICATURES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Since the appearance of
the excellent motion pic-
ture "Executive Suite" we
have been treated to several
television perform-
ances which also have
utilized the background of
American big business.
However, as is always true
of a vogue, the tendency is
to exaggerate and distort.

Two recent TV plays il-
lustrate what I mean. Both
were greeted by critics with
fervent applause.

One was a play called
"Patterns" which enjoyed
so much praise that it was
repeated. It is reported that
it will be made into a movie
and perhaps presented as a
Broadway play.

However, if its TV spon-
sor's business were conduct-
ed in the manner portrayed
by this show he would be
unable to sponsor anything
much longer. For such a
business could not survive.

A very wise editorial in
the Wall Street Journal
said of this travesty:

"The president of this
fictitious company is sup-
posed to be a hard-boiled,
driving executive. But as
portrayed he is a fool who
turns his executive commit-
tee meetings into snarling,
shouting free-for-all brawls
in which executives sound
like Elizabethan fishwives."

The said executive drives
into the grave an aging but
able and lovable subordi-
nate to make room for a
younger man who at first
can't decide whether to be
decent or indecent. He final-
ly decides to outdo his boss
as a blackguard.

The wife of the young
man provides an assist in
her husband's progress by
telling a false story to the
president of the company.
The husband weakly ac-
cepts the wages of her sin.

Another Play, "A Leaf
Out of the Book," was over-
looked by the Wall Street
Journal, but provided an
equally grotesque picture of
American business. Here
there were two unprinci-
pled, ambitious women-a
hard-and-40 type and a
21-year-old imitator.

Each labored feverishly
to ensnare the interest of a
flabby president who
seemed to be more inter-
ested in cocktails and
women than in his busi-
ness. The race seems to be
determined by the capacity
of one or the other of the
women to get the run of the
bar and the apartment of
president. Hard-and-40 won.

Not-quite-so-hard-21 final-
ly collapsed on a shoulder
provided by a supporting
actor brought in for that
purpose.

My own impression was
that any company run on
such a basis would hardly
be worth the efforts of one
woman, let alone two.

The Soviet masters would
enjoy these presentations
of American business. For
they are exactly what they
want their slaves to believe
us to be.

The lessons of such pro-
ductions are that the wages
of sin is success, that no-
body in the management of
business is interested in
serving the public and that
the masters of big business
are brutal, stupid, crooked
and lecherous.

I wonder what Messrs.
Reuther and Meany would
do and say if TV script
writers would portray such
goings on in labor affairs.

In the cases I have cited
business apparently is will-
ing not only to accept this
sort of thing but to pay
good money to have it
shown to the American pub-
lic.

For those who enjoyed
the fine balance of values,
economic and moral, in
"Executive Suite" these
imitations are poor fare.
