WHAT ARE
ASSETS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The budget presented by
the President is discourag-
ing news to those who
hoped that the Republican
pledge of economy might be
realized.
But it is only a part of
the story of the adventures
in Federal spending that
we shall presently hear
about. The report on high-
ways by Gen. Clay and
the prospective Presidential
plans for school building
and other purposes will set
up a huge series of im-
mense Federal obligations
which will not be reflected
in the President's budget at
all.
★
This means that the orig-
inal concept of an executive
budget, which would be a
comprehensive and inclu-
sive account of all Federal
finances, has been aban-
doned. There will be a budg-
et such as the President
has now presented, and, in
addition, there will be an-
other, indefinite Federal fi-
nancial account of obliga-
tions quite outside that
statement. Ultimately, the
outside budget will be as
large a national obligation
as the one we hear about
on budget day.
Aside from the perils of
multiplying budgets all over
the Washington landscape,
the President's budget it-
self has certain disturbing
features. The President has
not only adopted many of
the welfare programs of
the Roosevelt-Truman days,
but has vastly expanded
them. In addition, he has
adopted the New Deal habit
of using alluring terms to
sugar-coat hard facts. He
has even improved upon the
semantics of the New Deal
era.

Beginning in the Truman
administration, I believe
about four years ago, the
Budget Bureau provided
the President with certain
"supplementary tables and
explanatory analyses" to
soften the harsh edge of
spending. Certain things
that were built or paid for
were called "assets." Large
public works and improve-
ments and even military
equipment were classed as
assets. In this budget 90%
of the money spent for such
"assets," or $16,934,000,000,
is "for major national se-
curity programs, mostly for
military equipment."
Perhaps my theories of
finance are obsolete in this
new day of semantics, but
it has always been my un-
derstanding that nothing is
an asset that does not yield
a material return. Anything
that does not is a liability.

Guns and battleships do
not earn their keep. They
must be kept. They are not
assets. Highways, unless
they are self-liquidating,
are not assets. Moreover,
if such things are to be car-
ried as assets, they should
be accompanied by an item
for depreciation. No such
item appears in this merely
ornamental addition to the
budget.
Truman, however, did not
introduce the term "assets"
in his message proper. Ei-
senhower does, but without
much explanation of what
he means.
This idea is not new.
Roosevelt under the pres-
sure of certain advisers in-
troduced the idea of what I
would call "subjective as-
sets" into his 1939 budget
message. It was not bal-
anced against expenditures,
however. It was merely a
sort of political justifica-
tion for spending on certain
things.
★
At that time I wrote an
article in criticism of what I
called the 1939 "double-
sided budget," saying that
one side was to tell you how
much the government was
costing and the other was
"to make you feel better
about it."
"The President's message
completely mistakes the
true purpose of a budget.
A budget is a cash account
of expected income and
projected outlays. It is not
an inventory of the coun-
try's wealth. The Treasury
and the nation are not iden-
tical. The Treasury acts as
a paying and receiving tell-
er: the nation is a proprie-
tor."
I am content to let that
comment serve for this
Eisenhower device.
