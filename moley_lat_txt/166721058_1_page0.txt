DECAY OF
STATES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The President, despite
frequent avowals that he in-
tended to restore the con-
stitutional balance between
the Federal government
and the States, has proposed
two immense invasions of
local and State responsibili-
ty: highways and schools.
Both his announced
school program and the re-
port of his Clay commission
have recommended great
additions to the amount
now granted by the Federal
government to the States.
The steady march upward
of Federal grants-in-aid is a
most graphic picture of the
decay of our Federal system
of government. At the turn
of the century only $3,000,-
000 was paid from Federal
funds to the States. In 1912
the sum was $5,255,000, in
1920, $33,188,000. Under the
Federalist policies of
F-D. R. the sum jumped to
$836,632,000. By the end of
the war that sum had dou-
bled.

In the last fiscal year,
1953, for which Truman was
responsible, the Federal
government gave the States
$2,857,000,000. Under Ei-
senhower, who promised to
halt the invasion of the
States, the expenditures and
estimates for 1954, 1955 and
1956 are, according to his
budget, $2,657,000,000, $3,-
251,000,000 and $3,570,000,-
000. The school and high-
way programs, if enacted,
will, perhaps by 1960, dou-
ble the last Truman figure.
I have examined the Clay
report on highways and the
various documents on the
school program issued by
Secretary Oveta Culp Hob-
by and Education Commis-
sioner Samuel M. Brownell
and nowhere do I find a tru-
ly scientific determination
of what the States really
need to meet vitally neces-
sary building.

Indeed, the Clay report
has a hit or miss arrange-
ment of the statistics on fa-
tal accidents. It can be just
as easily shown and with
more devotion to the true
situation that the figures of
fatal accidents show that
the States are doing a fine
job in reducing highway
slaughter.
The Hobby-Brownell plea
is based upon figures taken
from the census and ap-
parently from the school au-
thorities in the various
States. There is no evi-
dence that these Federal
people have gone behind
such easily available
sources.
It is obvious that schools
need to be built and within
some limits the number can
be determined. But no evi-
dence is shown to indicate
how much each of the
States and local communi-
ties can or cannot afford to
build for themselves.
★
There is a good deal of
talk about "debt limits." I
take this to mean that when
local communities are re-
stricted by State law the
Federal government must
jump in with money to help.
Why cannot the States, by
amendment to their laws
and constitutions, expand
those limits?
When the late Beaufort
Jester was Governor of Tex-
as there was passed what is
known as the Gilmer-Aikin
Law. I am not entirely clear
about its details, but Gov.
Jester told me at the time
that it embodied a scientific
formula to determine what
a county could afford to con-
tribute and what the State
would have to grant for lo-
cal purposes. In short, an
economic formula was de-
vised to measure capacity to
pay.
★
It seems to me that with
all of the economic genii
who are wandering around
Washington enjoying Fed-
eral salaries some such for-
mula could be devised to de-
termine what a State can af-
ford in meeting its needs
and what it cannot af-
ford. Only with such a
yardstick can it be deter-
mined how much Federal
aid is needed by each State
concerned.
Under present conditions
the matter becomes a free-
for-all grab with plenty of
logrolling among the Sena-
tors and Congressmen from
the various States. These
Federal economists claim to
be "scientists" but appar-
ently they are unable to
solve even this rather sim-
ple problem.
