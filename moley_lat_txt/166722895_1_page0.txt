LIVING ON
THE CUFF
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

I feel like the Scotchman
who confessed to his con-
freres at a poker game that
he had noticed for some
hours that one of them had
ceased to breathe. He said:
"I'd be the last man to
bring bad news to a pleas-
ant party."

it is unpleasant to sug-
gest in the midst of glow-
ing anticipations of a boom
year ahead that our con-
cern should extend beyond
this year and next to the
years in which another gen-
eration must take up what
we have done or left un-
done. Unless all past expe-
rience is irrelevant and all
past maxims of economic
prudence false, we are pre-
paring, for some not too
remote future, a dreadful
awakening. To a large de-
gree America is living on
the cuff.

We were reminded of
this when after the Fed-
eral Reserve Board im-
posed a modest increase in
margin requirements, there
was weeping and wailing
and selling on Wall Street.

*

Whether the amount of
selling which followed this
tightening of credit was
evidence of an excessive
amount of pure speculation
by the public, I am not
able to say. In fact, it
would be difficult to tell
with any degree of accu-
racy whether there is an
excessive speculative in-
terest by people who can-
not afford it.

But this slight nudge by
the Federal Reserve Board,
together with the sharp re-
action that followed, might
well bring to our attention
the many sectors in the
economy of the country
where debt has been rising
at a very rapid rate. This
is true in the realm of gov-
ernment finance, and it is
true in many nongovern-
mental fields.

Not long ago, I was
among a group which was
considering the problem of
economy in government.
All went well while a num-
ber of items of governmen-
tal expenditure were con-
sidered.

Then the President's
highway program came up.
An automobile executive
who was present inter-
posed a suggestion that
this was an exception. The
new highways were need-
ed, he contended. They
would really be a great
economy in the long run,
he said, since cars waiting
or immoderately slowed
up in crowded streets and
highways were wasting
gas and manpower.

Later an objection was
made to the suggestion that
the proposed new "painless"
method of building schools
be condemned. The objec-
tor was a member of the
school board in a notable
suburb of a great city.

*

And so it goes. Everyone
is for economy in the ab-
stract. Everyone is against
the other fellow's spending.
When the various "pain-
less" programs are exam-
ined, you usually find bonds
privately bought but Fed-
erally guaranteed at the end
of the rainbow.

The school program is an
example. First, the State
would set up a building au-
thority which would issue
bonds and sell them to the
public. It would then build
schools. Then the local
boards would rent the
schools, and with the rent
the State authority would
pay off the bonds and the
interest thereon. But the
public would not buy the
bonds without a guarantee,
and that is where the Fed-
eral government enters the
picture. It would guarantee
the bonds. That would be
another liability to be hand-
ed on to another genera-
tion.

*

But this generation, how-
ever improvident it may be
about paying its way and
however callous it may be
about leaving debts to be
paid or defaulted by its
children, is certainly intent
so far as schools are con-
cerned on giving those chil-
dren the best it cannot af-
ford. The new "painless"
schools will no doubt be
equipped with all the lux-
urious trimmings that well-
paid architects can devise.
The next generation may
have a staggering debt to
carry, but it can look back
at a childhood in the lap of
luxury provided by bor-
rowed money.
