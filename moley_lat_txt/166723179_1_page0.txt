GRANDIOSE
ROAD PLAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In an article last week I
described some of the un-
sound financial proposals
made by Gen. Clay's adviso-
ry committee on a national
highway program as they
were pointed out by Sen.
Byrd.
There remain to be noted
some of the other objection-
able features of this plan
which concern principle,
practice and general justifi-
cation.
The principle of State and
local responsibility is well
established in this country,
despite the steady invasion
of the domain of the States
through Federal grants in
aid over the last three dec-
ades. We were told by Can-
didate Eisenhower in 1952
that the time had come to
stop that invasion.
*
The Clay plan, however,
would be the biggest inva-
sion of the States that we
have had since the Civil
War. It would forever ce-
ment the hold of the Fed-
eral government upon the
gasoline tax and probably,
by raising it to cover the
vast Federal expenditures
involved, would make it
difficult for the States to
maintain their own gaso-
line taxes at the present
levels.
Politicians in the States
will be quick to promise
lower taxes and reduced ex-
penditures on highways.
The Clay plan had no soon-
er been made known than
Gov. Harriman of New York
demanded the return of
$10,000,000 from the Thru-
way Authority to the State
Treasury for other pur-
poses.
Citizens everywhere—
farmers, workers, business
proprietors, and others—
will demand that as long as
good old Uncle Sam will
build roads, he ought to
build schools, prisons and
poorhouses.
*
I have examined the Clay
report most carefully and
without avail to find a clear-
cut definition of what part
of the highway building
will be regarded as Federal
and what will remain to the
States. If, as is implied, the
Federal interest in this vast
outlay of money is military,
the Federal interest ought
to make the transition from
one State to another easier
by improved connecting
links and also to fill in with
wise improvements spots in
the interstate system where
traffic is now difficult.
Those places are through
thickly populated areas
and through natural bar-
riers such as mountains.
The straightaway high-
ways now in existence in
most States provide no
problem of congestion.
On this point I am not
speaking by hearsay or
theory. I have, since 1946,
traveled over interstate
highways an average of
20,000 miles a year in pur-
suing my trade as a com-
mentator on national affairs
and problems. Those tours
have included 12 coast-to-
coast jaunts.
*
The map included in the
Clay report which shows
the places where this Fed-
eral money is to go is a
fantastic misrepresentation
of real needs. Over one
stretch in the Midwest
where the report proposes a
four-lane highway I wrote
on a typewriter in the front
seat for five straight hours
while my companion drove
at an average legal rate of
from 50 to 60 m.p.h., just
last summer. It was, in a
well settled State on a Sun-
day, when traffic is at a
maximum.
I could multiply such
testimony endlessly.
But if you would ask the
politicians in the States con-
cerned, they will not tell
you what you can learn by
driving over the highways.
They will tell you what
they want you to believe. I
wonder if the Clay group
drew their conclusions from
observation or from in-
terested parties.
The Clay plan, of course,
will enormously stimulate
the salivary glands of every
politician in the United
States. It is, as I said in the
previous article, an Army
engineer's dream. It is also
a politician's dream. It is a
taxpayer's nightmare.
