A SAFETY
VALVE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The vitality of the Repub-
licans who attended the Lin-
coln Day meeting in Chicago
was a good sign. There were
lively protests against what
was called the Eisenhower
administration's emphasis
on internationalism, its For-
mosa policy, its free spend-
ing and its failure to displace
more Truman appointees.

Such protests are not
dangerous to the success of
a great party and they may
be productive of much good.
There is validity in many of
the criticisms which were
voiced. They have been the
subject of continuous dis-
cussion among Republicans
in private.

There can be no harm in
making them public, es-
pecially in a nonelection
year. They may well prepare
the way for a strong Re-
publican appeal in 1956 and
they may induce wholesome
corrections in administra-
tion policies.

No useful purpose was
served, however, by some of
the talk at the Chicago
meeting. Gov. Bracken Lee
of Utah is a fine, conserva-
tive Republican. But to ad-
vocate with Lee the com-
plete repeal of the income
tax is as silly as would be
a revival of the proposition
to repeal all taxes except a
levy on land.

The income tax is a po-
tentially terrible instru-
ment. It could with a Social-
istic Congress in the saddle
permit the utter extinction
of economic freedom and
private property in Amer-
ica.

It should have been limit-
ed in the extent to which
it could capture private in-
come for public use. But to
repeal it would be disas-
trous.

It should be noted also
that Gov. Lee advocates this
radical reform at the same
time that he is asking Con-
gress to pour billions into
uneconomic reclamation
schemes in Utah and other
arid States.

Since Sen. McCarthy has
already been subjected to
so much criticism I regret
to add to the volume. But
for him to cry out against
the evacuation of the Ta-
chen Islands is to attempt
to substitute the sketchy
military knowledge of a
Senator for the considered
judgment of the people who
are by constitutional
authority and the power
conferred by Congress vest-
ed with such a decision.

When Gen. MacArthur
declared that Formosa was
essential to the protection
of the Philippines and
Japan, and thus to our de-
fense, most Americans ac-
cepted his judgment against
that of Dean Acheson.

That was a recognition of
the authority of our great-
est military mind against a
political lawyer.

In the case of the Tachens
we must vest the determina-
tion of what is best for us
with the weight of expert
authority.

Sen. McCarthy has won
the deep devotion of mil-
lions of Americans because
he came to be the emblem
of a great and significant
truth. But he violates this
devotion when he becomes
a mere fault-finder, espe-
cially when he discusses
things in which his judg-
ment is not authoritative.

Another distressing fea-
ture of the Chicago meeting
was the occasional threat
of a third-party movement.
Gen. Robert E. Wood wise-
ly reminded his hearers
that this was neither real-
istic nor timely.

There is not leadership
nor support essential at this
time for a conservative
third party.

Such a movement would
win the support of a very
few of the hard-headed poli-
ticians upon whom the
drudgery of a campaign
must depend.

They realize that they
have no alternative but to
try to win with Eisenhower.
As practical men they rec-
ognize that Eisenhower
represents half a loaf and
that to work for his defeat
would be suicide.

Both of the major parties
are large enough to harbor
safely a considerable num-
ber of differences. But dis-
satisfaction need not end in
disunion.
