RAYMOND MOLEY:
How Wrong 'Experts'
Can Be About Russia
In the very early morn-
ing of Feb. 8 thousands of
machines were ticking
away in newsrooms over
the country grinding out
items of no great impor-
tance.
It was like almost every
morning of the year. Sud-
denly there leaped out of
the trivia the astounding
news that Malenkov had re-
signed.
That loosed a flood of
speculation, all to the effect
that this meant that Khrush-
chev would succeed him.
Nobody seemed to be will-
ing to admit a doubt ex-
cept perhaps to qualify the
prediction by saying "suc-
ceed to power."
Then for some time there
was comment about Khrush-
chev and about Malenkov's
humiliating explanation of
the reasons for his resigna-
tion.
The speculation about
Khrushchev began at 7:08
a.m. and ran on until 8:04
a.m. when somebody made
the guess that Molotov and
Khrushchev jointly might
rule.
Hardly had this been
spelled out when at 8:07
a.m. it was announced that
Khrushchev had announced
the choice of Bulganin.
All of which shows how
perilous it is to predict what
will happen in a dictator-
ship.
Last week a Russian "ex-
pert" said in print for Amer-
ican readers that under the
fat, pasty exterior of Malen-
kov there was a man of
steel who, despite the pre-
tensions of Khrushchev,
would emerge victorious.
Which suggests that "ex-
perts" may be wrong.
Two years ago a wise
commentator, who knew
some of the inexorable
rules of history and of hu-
man nature, said that in-
stead of trying to fathom
the future course of Rus-
sian policy by scanning the
news reports and gossip
from capitals of Europe, he
reread the first few chap-
ters of the story of another
dictatorship, Gibbon's "The
Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire."
There he saw once more
the evidence that "the
wages of dictatorship is
death and dissolution."
He added that power not
only corrupts the man who
exercises it but all those
who wish to share or pos-
sess it.
This he concluded will
possess the members of the
oligarchy which prevailed
after the death of Stalin.
Emperor after emperor
succeeded each other in the
Roman empire after Au-
gustus with a constant
weakening of the essential
fiber of the state.
The military ultimately
held the power and sold
the throne, like a bit of
ornamental pageantry, to
the highest bidder.
The truth of that obser-
vation has been revealed
over and over since it was
made. Beria sought power
too soon and was destroyed.
The economic system failed
to respond, as Marxian
dogma decreed, and the
masses became restless.
Malenkov promised and
promised more food, more
consumer goods, and at
the same time muttered
threats about how his mili-
tary power was rising.
Now he confesses failure
and with that the admis-
sion of his own falsehoods.
The army rises to greater
power as it must in such a
state. For it is only armed
strength that can keep
down unrest within Rus-
sia and the satellites.
Perhaps this change to
Premier Bulganin means
that the die of war may be
cast, perhaps not. No one
can tell. All that we can
tell is that time is on our
side.
For the end of Malenkov
does not mean that ambi-
tion and intrigue are
asleep. Rather it means
that the macabre round
must go on with one dic-
tator after another until
all order and cohesion will
vanish.
I repeat that without war
time is on our side.
