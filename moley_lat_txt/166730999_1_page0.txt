ECHO DAM
FOLLY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Senate hearings on the
mammoth and indetermi-
nate Upper Colorado irriga-
tion and power project have
been completed and the
House Interior Committee
plans to rush the project
through in record time.
Here is bipartisanship at
its worst, for Democrats and
Republicans alike are united
in the effort to spend bil-
lions on a project whose
justification becomes more
shaky by the hour.
To prepare the way for
quick action the House
Committee whose chairman
is Rep. Engle, a California
Democrat, plans to allow
only 16 hours of hearings.
On the basis of the initial
cost alone this is at the rate
of $100,000,000 an hour.

★

To make matters still
worse one of the bills pro-
viding for this great project,
introduced by Rep. Aspinall
(D) Colo., provides a com-
pletely new financial plan.
Last year the administra-
tion measure provided that
the power and water users
should pay back the cost in
50 years. The Aspinall bill
allows 100 years, but the
Bureau of Reclamation has
offered no details about the
new scheme.
Anyone with a pencil can
see the immensely increased
cost to the taxpayers caused
by this extension of time.
For under the law irrigation
costs are supposed to be paid
back without interest.
The project as it was ap-
proved by the Interior De-
partment last year and as
presumably it will appear
again is a combination of
two big power dams and
11 "participating projects."
They are called "participat-
ing" presumably because
the irrigation they will pro-
vide will not pay for itself
but will "participate" in the
proceeds of the sale of
power from the two big
power dams.

But the plans for these
proposed dams, which are
supposed to be the source of
money for irrigation, reveal
more serious defects than
were known last year.
The larger one at Glen
Canyon may or may not
pass an engineering test.
There is grave doubt wheth-
er a dam so high can be sus-
tained by the walls and
floor of the canyon.
Some years ago when the
idea was first considered
the engineers declared that
it would be unsafe. Then
the Bureau of Reclamation
seemed to change its mind.
Now the Interior Depart-
ment is conducting tests to
answer the question defi-
nitely. The idea is that the
taxpayers through their
Congress should authorize
the dam and then the de-
partment would determine
later whether it could safe-
ly be built.
The Echo Park Dam was
thoroughly discussed last
year. Lovers of the nation-
al parks fought this propos-
al to destroy the beauty of
the great Dinosaur Nation-
al Monument.

★

This in itself was enough
to condemn the plan, for if
this monument were de-
stroyed the zeal of the bu-
reaucrats would no doubt
move on to other parks.
But there are two new
reasons for stopping this
folly.
The first is that the power
developed at Echo Park
cannot be sold by the gov-
ernment at a price which
the nearest available and
adequate market can afford
to pay.
To pay for itself the Echo
Park Dam must sell power
at a price approximately
50% higher than the power
can be produced by steam
at Salt Lake City. This con-
sideration pulls the props
from under the entire finan-
cial plan of the Upper Colo-
rado project.
Another consideration is
the presence of rich de-
posits of uranium in the re-
gion around Echo Lake.
The development of nu-
clear-electric power would
in a few years make the
great dam in Dinosaur real-
ly something for tourists to
see when their other nation-
al parks are no longer worth
visiting.
It would be next to the
Pyramid of Cheops, the
greatest monument to the
vanity and folly of mankind.
