THE CANT IN KEYNOTING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In many States over the
country there are guberna-
torial inaugurals, in some
there are Governor's mes-
sages, and in Washington
there will he plenty of ora-
torical flourishes, including
the President's message, to
start off the new Congress.
Therefore, this may be an
appropriate moment to con-
sider such utterances as
means of innocent beguile-
ment. For they are not
meant to be taken literally.
They are not literal, and
only occasionally literate;
they are not reasoned, for
they are not addressed to
reason.
They are music, not to re-
member, hut to feel and
forget. They are contribu-
tions to that body of our
folk literature known as
"keynoting."

Ed Lowry, whom I have
always admired as a master
delineator of the vagaries of
statesmen, thus defined that
word in an essay on Presi-
dent Harding:
"Keynoting implies the
ability to make melodic
noises and give the impres-
sion of passionately and tor-
rentially moving onward
and upward while warily
standing still."
As a specific example of
what I mean, I offer the in-
augural address of the Hon.
Averell Harriman, now
Governor of the State of
New York. His efforts de-
serve special note not only
because he has attained
high place in a State dis-
tinguished by a numerically
superior population but be-
cause in the preparation of
the document he is said to
have had the help of several
gentlemen who aided the
late F. D. R. in his speech
preparations in the latter
years of his ascendancy.
These men are capable of
rare grammatical gratifica-
tion. They also learned from
a master politician, F. D. R.
himself, the art of getting
the greatest good out of the
greatest number of voters.
To be sure, these speech-
wrights, no doubt in haste,
culled from the well-
thumbed hook of political
cliches such stuff (unwor-
thy of them) as: "The ques-
tion is not: Can we afford to
do what is needed? The
question is: Can we afford
not to?"
It is not kind to open
such a chestnut as this, but
because it will continue in
political usage for cen-
turies it is fair to add that
it prompts the question:
How are we to know when
the need is so great that
it goes beyond what we can
afford?
The cliche is based upon
a bit of fraudulent econom-
ics introduced by New Deal-
ers in the late 1930s. They
were in the habit of placing
an arbitrary monetary price
upon "social values."
Then they would balance
this on a scale with real
money and if the result was
not what they wanted they
simply raised their mone-
tary evaluation of "social
needs."
In this economic fairy-
land deficits grew and grew
and were blessed as the
flowers of a "dynamic econ-
omy."
But the Harriman speech
has neat new garb for old
species of double talk:
"I propose a hold, adven-
turous administration. I
propose that we reject no
approach because it is un-
orthodox and no answer
merely because it requires
a radical revision of pres-
ent machinery or prevailing
prejudices.
★
"Of course, I shall not pro-
pose action for action's
sake, or measures merely
for the sake of motion. We
shall not reject the tried
and true .. I suggest
only that our spirit be bold
and that our minds be fresh
and freed from cant in ap-
proaching the problems
that we face."
In short, in the bright
lexicon of politics there is
no such word as "cant."
To read this suggests that
in the coming 18 months we
shall have an entertaining
rhetorical contest between
the Governor of New York
and the ex-Governor of Illi-
nois, with the White House
as the prize. And on the
basis of the foregoing, Har-
riman already has scored
an alliterative advantage.
