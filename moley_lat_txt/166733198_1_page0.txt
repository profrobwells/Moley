THE NEW
POWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
A very significant discus-
sion of the possibilities of
nuclear energy in generat-
ing electricity was offered
last week before the mem-
bers of the Southeastern
Electric Exchange.
Some of the papers should
have been heard by mem-
bers of Congress who at the
moment are considering
great new expenditures on
Federal hydroelectric
plants. For unless the advo-
cates of public power take
note, they will be foisting
on the American people an
expensive bit of obsoles-
cence.

None except fatuous en-
thusiasts expect atomic en-
ergy to supplant overnight
the conventional forms of
fuel in activating steam
plants. But some means of
creating the heat necessary
to operate steam plants will
have to found within the
next 25 years to supple-
ment and finally supplant
coal and oil. Nuclear en-
ergy seems most certain to
meet that need.
The layman can hardly
comprehend the degree to
which new uses for electric-
ity have increased the de-
mand for power. In the last
20 years the capacity of our
power plants has increased
threefold.
In the next 20 years our
present production must be
increased fourfold. By 1975
our national use of electric-
ity will be 12 times that
of 1939.

Despite our great re-
sources in oil and coal, we
shall be pressing upon our
supply of those convention-
al types of fuel within the
lifetime of many people now
among us.
According to figures de-
veloped by Westinghouse,
our consumption of "ener-
gy units" would, if depend-
ent upon conventional fuel,
exhaust our known supply
of coal and oil before the
year 2000. Long before that,
according to the scientists,
we shall be using nuclear
energy—at first as a sup-
plement, but later as a sub-
stitute—and the probable
supply of that form of en-
ergy is said to be without
limit.

This conclusion was sub-
stantially restated by Fran-
cis K. McCune of General
Electric. He said that at the
probable rate of consump-
tion now anticipated the
supply of conventional fuels
in many parts of the world
would be gone. He cited the
anxiety of the British to
develop atomic power be-
cause the limits of the sup-
ply of coal in the British
Isles are already in sight.
Philip Sporn, president
of the American Gas &
Electric Co., is a man whose
engineering wisdom is
highly regarded in the in-
dustry. For some time he
has been warning the pri-
vate companies against too
implicit an acceptance of
the claims of enthusiasts
for atomic energy.
★
At this meeting, however,
he went so far as to tell
his audience that they
should not sit back and "let
George do it." Following the
example of Consolidated
Edison, the companies
should, according to Sporn,
install atomic reactors of
various forms in a tentative
and experimental way and
out of this experiment de-
termine the best of several
possible models for the fu-
ture.
A clear implication of all
that was said at this meet-
ing is that hydroelectric
power in this country has
a very limited part to play
in meeting the needs of the
future. A few, very low-
cost projects such as those
on the Columbia River will
pay out.
But with costs what they
are, and obsolescence due
to silt deposits and other
factors what they are, the
Federal government might
well hesitate about further
great investments in this
form of producing power.
