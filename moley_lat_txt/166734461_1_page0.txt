EISENHOWER IS STILL
SOLID IN SOUTH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I offer an old and well-
worn quote of Emerson by
way of paying a deserved
tribute to the President.
The great essayist began his
discourse on "character"
with this sentence:
"I have read that those
who listened to Lord Chat-
ham felt that there was
something finer in the man
than anything which he
said."
This quality, Emerson ex-
plained, "is that which we
call character- a reserved
force which acts directly by
presence, and without
means."
*
That fairly well explains
why, after talking with a
considerable number of peo-
ple in Florida, the Carolinas
and Virginia, I am able to
report that while there is
determined opposition there
to many of the measures
sponsored by the President,
his popularity as shown in
1952 is now substantially
undiminished.
In 1952 Eisenhower car-
ried Florida and Virginia
by fairly substantial mar-
gins. He lost South Caro-
lina narrowly. He received
a much larger percentage
of the vote than was cast
for Dewey in 1948.
Altogether, in these four
States he received 1,483,106
votes, while 1,446,900 were
cast for Stevenson.
*
No one to whom I put the
question in those States ad-
vanced the opinion that
Eisenhower has lost any of
the popularity which he
enjoyed in 1952. Some were
even willing to say that he
is now stronger. Most of
these informed people ex-
pressed the opinion that the
South has no chance to
nominate one of its own
conservative sons.
It is believed that Sen.
Richard Russell's delegate
strength of 294 on the sec-
ond ballot in the 1952 Dem-
ocratic convention is about
the maximum.that a con-
servative Southerner could
get in a convention next
year.
Kefauver might do bet-
ter, but that would be be-
cause he is regarded as an
acceptable liberal by many
parts of the North, despite.
and not because he comes
from a Southern State.
This being true, there is
no real hope that the con-
servatives in the Democrat-
ic Party, North or South
can ever regain control of
their party.
â˜…
They are therefore com-
pelled to support an accept-
able Republican Party sys-
tem for candidates for local
office and for Congress.
For while it is probable
that Eisenhower might car-
ry three of the four States
in 1956, it is not possible
to report any considerable
growth of a two-party sys-
tem except in some sections
of Florida and Virginia.
Opposition in the four
States to the twin Federal-
aid proposals of Eisenhow-
er this year, the highway
and school building pro-
grams, is fairly general.
This is because believers
in State's rights and respon-
sibilities see in these meas-
ures a further growth of
Federal power.
*
In the case of the school
program, moreover, they
realize quite well that an
amendment might well be
attached to a bill by north-
ern liberals to deny support
to States which maintain
segregation.
Opposition to the Pres-
ident's highway program is
based upon a belief, notably
in Virginia and the Caro-
linas, that they are quite
capable of building their
own highways,
Perhaps I am reading
something into the opinions
of the people with whom
I talked when I add that
they believe that peace and
national safety are well pro-
tected by Eisenhower. His
military judgement is trust-
ed for safety, and his will
to preserve peace with hon-
or is assured.
