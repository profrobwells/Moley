RAYMOND MOLEY:
One Way to Remedy
Chronic U.S. Deficit
The President's budget
estimates for the fiscal year
1055 offer little hope that
there will be any relief from
high spending in the future.
Economy minded Lon-
gressmen must turn for re-
lief to drastic checks upon
the Executive. And the
most practical of suggested
remedies is Rep. Coudert's
bill and proposed constitu-
tional amendment requiring
balanced hudgets except in
times of national emergen-
cies.
The end of June will
show, according to the esti-
mates, another deficit this
time amounting to $2.900,-
000,000, which is only $400,-
000.000 less than last year.
The six years' record go-
ing back to the year before
Korea shows that Republi-
can improvement over the
Democratic record has not
been impressive.
In that sweet, almost for-
gotten fiscal year 1950 the
Federal government spent
only $39,600,000,000 and re-
ceived only $36,500.000.000
from taxpayers and other
sources.
★
The miracle of a surplus
came with June, 1951, large-
ly because of war orders
and higher taxes.
But when the next year
ended in June, 1952, there
was a deficit of four billion.
The new Eisenhower ad-
ministration was compelled
in June, 1953, to register a
whopping deficit of $9,400,-
000.000, which, in justice,
could be charged against
the outgoing Truman re-
gime.
Politically, the appear-
ance of that immense spend-
ing peak was a windfall for
the Republicans. For they
simply could not think up
the means to spend any-
thing like $74,000,000,000.
But they succeeded in
spending, in their first full
year, the tidy sum of $70,-
900,000,000.
That sum would have
been higher if the House of
Representatives had not
hacked four billion from
the Eisenhower estimates.
The first. Republican def-
icit was therefore $3,300.-
000.000. And now we shall
have another Republican
deficit, of $2,900,000,000.
Looking back, the aver-
age Democratic deficit over
four of the six years was
$3,250,000,000. The average
of the two years for which
the Republicans will be re-
sponsible will be $3,100,-
000.000. This is a meager
saving, considering the bold
campaign promises in 1952
about cleaning up the mess
and ending the extrava-
gance.
The cold truth is that
something more than the
will of this administration
and the limited efforts of
Congressional committees
will he needed to bring
about balanced budgets.
This is the reason why
something like the Coudert
reform is in order.
*
The Coudert bill, which
was HR 2 in the last Con-
gress, provides that expend-
itures by the Federal gov-
ernment shall not exceed
receipts except in time of
war or of "grave national
emergency."
In both cases, war and
"grave national emergency,"
a declaration by Congress is
required. A Presidential
emergency would not be
sufficient.
To be sure, this measure
if passed would be only a
self-denying ordinance.
Since it would be only a
simple act of Congress, it
could be overridden by Con-
gress. Rut like the legal
debt ceiling, which is also
mere self-denial, it would be
a warning against extrava-
gance and a mark to shoot
at.

To make it really binding
on Congress and the Execu-
tive, Rep. Coudert has pre-
pared and introduced a con-
stitutional amendment pro-
viding for the same limita-
tion as that contained in his
bill.
His bill received a favor-
able report by the House
Committee on Government
Operations in the 83rd Con-
gress. Coudert is planning
to introduce it and the pro-
posed amendment in the
new Congress.
If that Congress really
wants to save, this is its
chance to prove its sin-
cerity.
