PARTY OR
ARMY?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The American citizen who
is perplexed by the torrent
of comment by experts and
others since the resigna-
tion of Malenkov might
well note that he has a
choice between two fairly
clear but opposing theories
of what has happened and
is happening in Moscow.

The first is that the Red
army has been in the ascend-
ancy since some time be-
fore the death of Stalin two
years ago and that the
choice of Bulganin rather
than Khrushchev as Pre-
mier shows the cementing
of army control.

This argument is greatly
strengthened by the desig-
nation of Zhukov as Defense
Minister. Two years ago,
after the death of Stalin, an
ardent advocate of the
theory that the Red army
will be supreme said:

"Watch Marshal Georgi
Zhukov. That is the chief
tip-off of those experts who
dare look for portents since
Stalin's death. They see the
Soviet army emerging as
the most cohesive, respect-
ed and powerful force in the
Communist world.

"Even Stalin, with his
overriding prestige, alter-
nately had to purge and
cajole the army to keep it
under control."

Further strength is given
to the pro-army argument
by the undeniable fact that
it is the army and not
ideology or the Communist
Party that holds the satel-
lites in its grip. An idea is
words but a soldier is a real
man with a gun in his
hands.

Against this argument
that the army is in control
is the argument that Stalin
himself after the death of
Lenin ignored the top
governmental posts and
held onto the job of first
secretary of the party.

Ultimately from that post
of power he was able to
purge Trotsky and later
Zinoviev, the man who
helped him against Trotsky.

This argument goes on to
point out that from the mo-
ment that Khrushchev took
over the post of first secre-
tary of the party the power
of Malenkov was actually
lost.

*

The advocates of this
theory point out that the
Red army has weaknesses
that were not present in the
armies under other dictator-
ships in history. It is per-
meated by agents of the
party who can break any
officers suspected of seeking
power for themselves.

One advocate of the party
theory told me shortly after
the fall of Malenkov that his
theory was proved by the
fact that Khrushchev in ad-
dition to his job of first sec-
retary of the party would
hold the post of Defense
Minister, thus putting him-
self between Bulganin and
the army. This theory was
almost immediately blown
to bits by the fact that
Zhukov, not Khrushchev,
took the Defense Ministry.

The experts although di-
vided on the question
whether the party or the
army is on top are agreed
that war is probably not im-
minent. The violence of the
speeches at the meeting in
Moscow is simply more of
the old stuff.

*

The real fact so embarras-
singly revealed in the resig-
nation of Malenkov is that
the nation is not prepared
for war. It is openly con-
fessed that the production of
food is inadequate.

It is confessed by infer-
ence that the military po-
tential is inadequate be-
cause of the decision to
shorten the supply of con-
sumer goods and to increase
heavy industry.

If a nation is fully pre-
pared to strike it need not
make such an admission.

Despite these conflicting
interpretations of what has
really happened in the
Soviet high command it can
be confidently assumed
that the personal struggle
for power will go on.

If Khrushchev were com-
pletely sure of his ascend-
ancy he would not have to
operate through other peo-
ple. He would take com-
mand openly himself.

Perhaps, as in Stalin's
case, he will achieve that
power later. But he must,
in order to do so, be pos-
sessed of the tremendous
personal qualities of the
late dictator. He has not yet
demonstrated such personal
traits.
