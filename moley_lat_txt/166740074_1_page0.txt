THREE WINGS AGAINST M'CARTHY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those who were in ac-
cord with the censure of
Sen. McCarthy seem to
have divided themselves
into three groups.
The first believes that
while the Wisconsin Sen-
ator did a good many use-
ful things in exposing Com-
munism in the government,
he lost that usefulness be-
cause of his methods of in-
vestigation or at least be-
cause of his intemperate
language.
★
These people fully recog-
nize that Congress could
and should carry on in-
vestigations of the execu-
tive departments of the
government and that the
presence of subversion in
vital spots makes such in-
vestigations imperative in
a critical period like this.
The second group would
deny altogether the right,
morally or legally, of Con-
gress to investigate the
executive at all. This group
claims that since the Presi-
dent is responsible to the
voters, he needs no other
check and that so far as
malfeasance and misfea-
sance are concerned, they
can be handled by the FBI,
the Federal prosecuting
agencies and the courts.
This group fails to real-
ize the implications of the
balance of power in our
government: the simple
fact that the FBI does not
initiate prosecutions; that
the Federal prosecuting
agencies are part of the
executive, and that the
courts try but do not prose-
cute suspected offenders.
The third group would
uphold some investigations
but condemn others. Tel-
ford Taylor was a member
of the group of young men
emanating from the Har-
vard Law School in the
early 30s. In the course of
various government serv-
ices he acquired the title of
brigadier general. Most no-
table of his services was
that of assistant prosecutor
of the Germans at Nuern-
berg.
★
Taylor, in many speeches
over the last two or three
years, has hurled invec-
tive at McCarthy, notably
at West Point in 1953. Now
he has gathered together
what he has to say with a
considerable show of legal
and historical erudition in
a book called "The Grand
Inquest." It is a study in
confused vituperation.
Taylor does not claim that
Congress should not investi-
gate almost everything in
the government and out.
But some investigations he
considers constructive and
necessary, and others he
considers unnecessary and
mischievous.
Samuel Untermeyer's in-
vestigation of Wall Street 40
years ago was fine. So was
the Walsh investigation of
the oil scandal 10 years lat-
er. So was the Fletcher in-
vestigation of banking, in
which Pecora was the prose-
cutor a decade after that.
But the investigations of
the McCarthy committee,
notably into the situation at
Monmouth, were bad and
unnecessary. So was the
Reece inquiry into tax-ex-
empt foundations.
★
The Pecora investigation
was especially useful, Tay-
lor thinks, because its "sus-
tained and sensational pub-
licity" did a lot to sell the
New Deal to the people.
This would seem to attrib-
ute to this "constructive"
inquiry a political slant, but
it is politics in line with
Taylor's politics.
It would be easy to dwell
upon inconsistency and er-
ror in this book, but it is
more important to point out
that it was conceived in the
spirit of a movement, quite
prominent in the last two
years, to exalt the executive
and claim that the Congress
is usurping power.
It is the movement whose
catchword is "the tyranny
of Congress." This book be-
longs to the literature of
that movement.
