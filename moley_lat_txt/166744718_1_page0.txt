SOUTHERN
SCHOOLS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
COLUMBIA, S.C.—It was
noted with interest here
that the General Assembly
of North Carolina passed a
law turning over to the
school districts of the State
full authority over the as-
signment and enrollment of
children in the public
schools.
This is a major step short
of the complete abandon-
ment of the public school
system. It will place in the
path of the enforcement of
the Supreme Court's opin-
ion, on segregation years
and years of litigation. It
has been called fragmentiz-
ing the problem.
This step has already been
taken by South Carolina,
which has already amend-
ed the State Constitution to
prepare the way for the
abandonment of the public
school system if necessary.
The meaning of these
steps becomes apparent
when the exact nature of
the action last year by the
Supreme Court is recog-
nized.
★
The court, in Chief Jus-
tice Warren's opinion, sim-
ply said that the segrega-
tion of the races in schools
is in violation of the Con-
stitution. It failed to take
any steps to enforce its
opinion, or to indicate how
it could be enforced.
Instead, it announced that
in October it would hear
arguments designed to tell
how its decision could be
enforced.
Indeed, when the late
Justice Jackson asked the
government’s attorney in
the case how he proposed
to enforce an opinion favor-
ing his case, the attorney
was unable to answer.
At that time it surprised
some lawyers that the court
failed to remand the case to
the lower courts to deter-
mine by decrees the exact
method of enforcement.
That is what the Attorney
General is now suggesting
to the court, a year later.
It is in anticipation of
such a decision by the court,
this spring that the States
are hastening to scatter re-
sponsibility to the local
boards for assigning pupils
to schools.

The number of separate
cases involved over the
South can be comprehended
when it is considered that
there are 102 school dis-
tricts in South Carolina and
174 in North Carolina.
If the court turns the de-
termination of enforcement
over to the District Courts,
litigation to enforce the de-
crees must be started in
school districts by citizens
against school district trus-
tees. Such cases will present
an infinite variety of fact if
not of law.
If the District judge de-
cides against the school
trustees, he may (I am not
sure whether he must)
make his decrees binding on
all school districts in his
judicial district. There are
two judicial districts in
South Carolina and three in
North Carolina. Such litiga-
tion will require a long, long
time.
It was said by Justice
Jackson during the trial of
the case a year ago that it
would involve a generation
of litigation. The present
prospects would seem to
bear out that guess.

Meanwhile, the States are
moving ahead in the recon-
struction of their schools.
In South Carolina Gov.
Byrnes spent considerably
more than $100,000,000 on
his school-building pro-
gram, and 69% of that mon-
ey went for Negro schools.
Negroes, as well as whites
in the State, are justifiably
proud of their new schools.
An examination of the
facts convinces me that any
early attempt to end segre-
gation would not only end
in frustration and failure
but would do inestimable
harm. The problems in-
volved vary from school to
school and from district to
district.
It would take an army of
educational geniuses to de-
sign new curricula for
mixed schools. For there
are even now, for example,
differences between the
needs of Negroes and
whites in the same grades.
Northern opponents of
segregation, however sin-
cere and zealous, should
realize that there is a vast
gap between enacting a law
and squaring that law with
the facts.
