STASSEN'S MANEUVERS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The administration is well
aware of the help, however
amall, which Harold Stassen
gave to Candidate Eisen-
hower before and during
the 1952 convention. Since
politics is politics that
means a good spot for the
onetime Governor of Min-
nesota.
But also, since politics is
politics, the wise politicians
in and around the White
House and the national
committee are aware of the
facts that the foreign aid
program is a heavy burden
of unpopularity, some of
which is due to the zeal and
liberality with which Stas-
sen has administered it.
Speculation in Washing-
ton indicates that when the
decreed end of the Foreign
Operations Administration
comes on June 30, Stassen
and his whole outfit will be
moved into the State De-
partment. Thus the army of
fund dispensers associated
with Stassen may sing the
song of all bureaucrats: "If
My Bark Sinks, 'tis to An-
other Sea."

The managers of the
Eisenhower campaign in
1952 are probably well
aware of the usefulness of
Stassen at that time. But the
story has never been told
more graphically than in a
new biography of Hugh Roy
Cullen, the Houston million-
aire oilman, by Ed Kilman
and Theon Wright.
According to their story,
which is amply fortified
with the personal letters of
Cullen himself, Stassen first
aroused the ire of the man
from Texas in 1945.
At that time Cullen wrote
a letter to President Tru-
man deploring the appoint-
ment of Stassen as a dele-
gate to the San Francisco
conference which created
the United Nations.
In 1948 Cullen again
lashed out at Stassen in a
speech in Houston telling of
the latter's advocacy of "a
world police force . . . sub-
ject to the directions of a
'foreign court" in which the
United States would exer-
cise about 5% of the voting
power.
While there is no indica-
tion that Cullen's opposi-
tion to the internationalism
of Stassen had lessened, he
conceived the idea that his
candidacy might be useful
to Eisenhower. And so Cul-
len wrote to Eisenhower in
late 1951 as follows:
"I persuaded Stassen to
put his hat in the ring with
the idea of controlling cer-
tain electoral votes in the
Northwest; and I asked Dan
Gainey, who was Harold
Stassen's campaign man-
ager in the last Presidential
election, to open offices and
start working for Harold.

"After discussing the
matter over the phone with
Stassen, he has decided to
visit you in Europe to dis-
cuss certain matters with
you . . . I asked Harold
Stassen to get in the Presi-
dential race to stop Taft."
The Stassen hat hit the
ring with such force after
this that Cullen began to
have his doubts. He wrote
to Eisenhower again early
in 1952:
"He (Stassen) has done
many things recently of
which I do not approve, the
last being that of telling
the voters of Wisconsin
that he is going to give you
half the electoral votes in
that State (Cullen seems to
confuse delegates with elec-
toral votes) . . . I also know
that he has approached
Gen. Marshall. In other
words, he is working both
sides of the street."
Later he wrote to Eisen-
hower that "it is doubtful
which way Stassen will act
at the convention."

Cullen's doubts grew and
grew until after Stassen had
been appointed to the Mu-
tual Security job he wrote
again to his friend, the
President, that he was of
the opinion that Stassen
was "mentally a conserva-
tive at heart . . . a Socialist."
Roy Cullen, who had an
amazing capacity to find oil
where others had failed, was
thus frustrated in the sandy
oil of politics. But he can
be assured that his worries
about Stassen are shared
by many of his country-
men.
