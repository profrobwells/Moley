ON LOGROLLING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A great many observers
of popular government have
sadly concluded that such a
system might well destroy
itself. No doubt that fear
was in the minds of the
makers of our Constitution
when they created not a
democracy but a represent-
ative republic.
It was hoped that by bal-
ancing against the more
democratic House a Senate
of representatives of the
States the benefits of popu-
lar government might be
enjoyed without running
the risks that such a gov-
ernment would by its ex-
cesses destroy itself.
But we are witnessing,
year by year, a situation in
which the danger of de-
struction by excessive in-
dulgence in spending looms
more ominously in the Sen-
ate than in the House.
*
There is, to be sure,
plenty of logrolling in the
House. But on account of
the fact that in the House
there is greater relative
strength from the States
which pay the most taxes,
and less relative strength
from the States which seek
to get the most from the
government, it is the House
that tends more toward
economy, and the Senate
that tends toward spending.
An example of the tacit
agreements that prevail in
the Senate was revealed in
the debate over the passing
of the great Upper Colorado
Storage Project last week.
In the course of that de-
bate Sen. Paul Douglas
made an exceptionally able
argument against the proj-
ect, calling attention to the
immense cost to the big tax-
paying States and the dis-
proportionate amount of
benefits received by States
that pay a negligible return.
*
He pointed out that the
Mountain States which en-
joy the benefit of vast ap-
propriations for reclama-
tion have only 3% of the
population but 16% of the
votes in the Senate. He then
said:
"Sometimes I think the
arld and semiarid States en-
ter into joint combinations
with the States of the Low-
er Mississippi in a process
of rolling each other's logs,
the States of the Lower Mis-
sissippi getting big appro-
priations for rivers and oc-
casionally for harbors, and
the States in the mountain
areas getting appropriations
for reclamation, but in nei-
ther case is interest being
paid, and in the case of the
Lower Mississippi States
not even principal is being
returned for the land that is
reclaimed by the deepening
of the Mississippi."
Thereupon Sens. O'Ma-
honey of Wyoming and An-
derson of New Mexico loud-
ly protested such an impli-
cation. The former, whose
Irish sense of humor seemed
to have deserted him for
the moment, maintained
that the people of his State
have "high standards."
That, of course, was not the
issue.
Sen. Anderson then as-
serted that never had a Sen-
ator from the Mississippi
Valley approached him on
the subject of a mutual deal
between the regions and
vice versa. That, of course,
failed utterly to meet the is-
sue raised by Douglas, who
had been talking about
"tacit" understandings, not
open deals.
*
Such tacit understandings
have in fact been the up-
written law of the Senate
for years.
Another tacit matter ap-
peared in the vote on the
measure. Twelve Senators
from the Middle West voted
for the arid States. Can that
be because the opening of
the St. Lawrence means
that vast sums must be
spent for improvements in
and around the Great Lakes
in years to come? Such mu-
tual co-operation was quite
evident in votes in the last
Congress.
The big question is: how
long this can go on? For one
region after another must
eventually have its own spe-
cial ax to grind.
Ultimately there may be
more favors for which mu-
tual aid is necessary than
there is money. At that
point the melancholy pre-
dictions of some critics of
popular government may be
vindicated. And thinking
people will wonder wheth-
er we can afford to be free,
