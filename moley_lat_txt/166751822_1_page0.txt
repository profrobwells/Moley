HOOVER'S
TASK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Unlike the Commission
on Intergovernmental Re-
lations headed for a time
by Clarence E. Manion, the
Hoover Commission on Or-
ganization of the Executive
Branch of the Federal Gov-
ernment is a creation of
Congress.
The Manion group was
an executive matter. The
Hoover Commission reports
directly to Congress. Only
four of the 12 members
were appointed by the Pres-
ident.
This Hoover Commission,
moreover, operates under a
broader grant of power than
its predecessor, which was
created by a Republican
Congress in 1947 and which
reported in 1949.
★
The former commission
had no substantial author-
ity to bring into question
the desirability of any func-
tion then performed by the
Federal government. It was
not to question why, but
only inquire how!
The present commission
interprets its authority in
these words of its progress
report of Dec. 31, 1954:
"The commission decided
to undertake the work en-
joined upon it by its en-
abling act by making an ex-
haustive investigation of
certain broad functions of
the government and by con-
sidering questions of policy
as well as those of organi-
zation and operation."
Its method of operation,
however, has resembled
that of the original group.
It has 13 task forces drawn
from distinguished people
in all the fields of inquiry;
and each task force has a
small but experienced staff.
★
The question of authority
to go into questions of pol-
icy as well as operation is
vital. For while it is im-
portant to save a relatively
small amount of money by
recommending better meth-
ods of doing what the gov-
ernment is now doing, it is
vastly more important to
bring into question whether
many of the things that
government does should be
done at all.
Some members of the
task forces have been some-
what in doubt, however,
about recommending mat-
ters of policy now that the
Democratic Party is in con-
trol of Congress.
Since the Democratic Par-
ty is responsible for the
original policy decisions
which launched the Federal
government into so many of
its present functions, they
wonder how far any recom-
mendations of policy can go.
★
The terms of the act cre-
ating the commission seem
clearly to place policy with-
in its scope. Among other
things, the duties of the
commission include:
"Recommending methods
and procedures for reducing
expenditures to the lowest
amount consistent with the
efficient performance of es-
sential services, activities
and functions . . ."
"This would seem to grant
the power to interpret what
are "essential services and
functions . . ."
The commission is also
authorized to recommend
the elimination of "non-
essential services, functions
and activities which are
competitive with private
enterprise."
★
Such a grant of power is
indeed a necessary one. For
a vast amount of govern-
ment business is being con-
ducted which should be in
private hands.
There will be screams
from the Social Democrats
in Congress when any such
recommendations are made.
But regardless of what dis-
position this Congress may
make of the final Hoover
report, it should be, for a
long time to come, a stand-
ard to which lovers of econ-
omy and enemies of super-
government can repair.
