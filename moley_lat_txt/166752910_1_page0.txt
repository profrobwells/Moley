RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Colorado River Bill
and the Hasty Senate
On a few days' notice
and before the ink was dry
on the committee report,
Senators from the benefici-
ary States rushed to pass
one of the most expensive,
ill-planned and unneces-
sary reclamation projects
in history.
The Colorado River Stor-
age, Project, in which Colo-
rado, Wyoming, Utah and
New Mexico cut the pork,
was introduced last year in
several versions. The In-
terior Committees of the
two houses of Congress,
which are packed by mem-
bers from reclamation
States and are not repre-
sentative of the States
which must pay for these
projects, reported different
versions.
Both failed to get action
before adjournment.

The President mentioned
a Colorado storage project
in both his state of the Un-
ion and budget messages,
but it is doubtful that he is
familiar with the monstrous
exaggeration which has just
passed the Senate.
The present bill will cost
at least 80% more than the
one approved by the Interi-
or Department and the
President last year. And
the hidden interest cost
would be more than four
billion dollars.

The Senate subcommittee
that "investigated" this
bill was composed of Sens.
Millikin, O'Mahoney, Wat-
kins and Anderson, who
represent only the bene-
ficiary States, and Jackson
of Washington, who has his
own projects to promote.
Not one member of a siz-
able taxpaying State was
represented. None of these
men come from the States
east of Colorado.

There are many reasons
why this bill should not be
passed by the House. But
space permits mention of
only four which are vital-
ly important.
The addition at immense
expense of several thou-
sands of acres of irrigated
land is involved, on the ut-
terly ridiculous ground that
we are going to need more
food.
The Department of Agri-
culture in several scientific
studies has proved that
with present acreage we
shall not only be paying
out immense subsidies for
surplus food but that im-
proved means of farming
will make further acreage
unnecessary for many dec-
ades to come.
Why was the Senate Com-
mittee unwilling to ask Sec-
retary Benson the plain
question: "Is this food nec-
essary?"

The Secretary of the In-
terior has admitted since
the project was before Con-
gress last summer that
there is engineering doubt
about the capacity of the
floor and sides of Glen Can-
yon to support the $500,-
000,000 dam proposed for
that spot. Taxpayers are
asked to buy a pig in a poke.
The nearest sizable mar-
ket for the power to be gen-
erated at the other proposed
big dam, at Echo Park, is
Salt Lake City. Steam pow-
er at that city can produce
electricity at a fraction of
the cost in the govern-
ment's calculations.
Echo Park Dam would be
in a national monument of
incomparable splendor. The
dam, according to the Park
Service, would irreparably
deface it. This would also
violate an old, respected
tradition-never to build
such things in national
parks and monuments.
★
The most indefensible
feature of this pell-mell ac-
tion of the Senate is that it
is probably prompted by a
determination to pass the
project before the Hoover
Commission is able to sub-
mit its report on the sub-
ject. It will be another
month or six weeks before
the Hoover Commission
can digest and pass upon
its task force report, which
is already completed.
Since ex-Gov. Leslie Mill-
er has been in charge of
the Hoover Subcommittee
on Reclamation, it can be
assumed that the report is
adverse. For Miller has al-
ready testified against the
project before Congression-
al committees.
The Hoover Commission
is a creation of Congress.
Herbert Hoover has more
competence in a matter of
this kind than any other
man who has ever held high
office in our time. Why
should the House not wait
until the opinion of his
commission has been ren-
dered on this subject?
