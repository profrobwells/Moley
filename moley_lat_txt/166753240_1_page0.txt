RAYMOND MOLEY:
One Driver's Report
on National Highways
DELRAY BEACH, Fla. â€”
I am not offering this article
as an expert reporter on
highways. I am just a citizen
who enjoys his automobile
and who has since the war
traveled an average of
20,000 miles annually on
interstate highways.
Since I had not been on
a tour since last summer, I
was somewhat disturbed by
the reports of some of the
advocates of Gen. Clay's
highway plan.
They have been saying,
among other things, that
our highways are obsolete
and death traps and that
they are rapidly falling to
pieces. I decided to see what
had happened since last
July. At that time, they
seemed to be in good condition
over a greater part of
the West.
Two weeks ago I acquired
a new car in Detroit
and drove it to New York.
The Michigan highways
rank with the best in the
nation. Ohio is completing
a magnificent turnpike from
west to east across the
State.
Pending its completion,
other highways reveal no
great deficiencies. Everyone
knows the capacity and efficiency
of the Pennsylvania
Turnpike. The New Jersey
Turnpike carries you to the
edge of New York.
Now I have completed
three not-too-long days traveling
from New York City
to Southern Florida. They
were days of comfortable,
reasonably rapid transportation.
This was despite one
whole day of rain and a
half-day of snow.
It is true that there are
spots where people who like
to make 75 m.p.h. may be
irritated by honest burghers
who abide by the law. And
the course through and
around some cities could be
improved. But there are
plenty of evidences that the
States are everywhere taking
steps to make corrections.
I was spared the sight of
any accident this year and
also last year, although six
or eight years ago carnage
was a common occurrence.
Gen. Clay's report, incidentally,
does not say that
the number of fatalities has
not appreciably increased
since the 1930s, despite vast
increases in the number of
cars and the power thereof.
Good policing and limited
speed still remain as the
sure ways to meet the tragedy
of highway slaughter.
All this is not to say that
there is not great need to
keep highway building and
improvement in line with
the mounting growth in
the number of automobiles
and drivers in the future.
I am simply suggesting
that all that has passed in
highway construction by
present co-operative methods
between the States and
the Federal government has
not been of the horse and-
buggy era.
There were builders before
Clay, and reasonable
help was provided by Congress
to the States without
upsetting the Federal fiscal
system or shifting all responsibility
to Washington.
The fact is that despite
all of the phony financing,
jerry-built plans for construction,
and the great big
figures in the Clay plan, it
will, if adopted, produce less
modern highway construction
over the next 25 years
than the present system
with some modifications in
Federal tax laws.
This is proved by the
great state paper presented
to the Committee on Public
Works by Sen. Byrd. In another
article I shall have
more to say about the Byrd
statement.
