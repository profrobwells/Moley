Harold Stassen's Foreign
Operations Administration
and its predecessors have
appropriated at a rate of
$450,000,000 a year to the
British aircraft industry for
the manufacture of jet
fighters.
The first effect of this
was to release British funds
for the making of jet planes
for civil use which will com-
pete with American air-
lines seeking international
traffic. The second effect
was to injure the American
aircraft manufacturing in-
dustry which has been suf-
fering serious unemploy-
ment.

These results, however,
might be justified if our
contribution in money were
to provide planes which
would materially strength-
en British military poten-
tial: But the evidence is
overwhelming that the
money, or a great part of it,
has been wasted.
Apparently the planes
produced with American
money have been in some
cases useless and in others
subject to very rapid ob-
solescence.
The inadequacy of some
of the planes built with our
money has been fully
pointed out in the British
press, in American techni-
cal air journals and in Par-
liamentary debate last De-
cember.
Most important, this de-
plorable example of wasted
money is in a report to a
Hoover Commission task
force by a competent man
who has been investigating
our foreign aid.

In reply to this criticism
Stassen lashed out at the
latter in a press conference
on Aug. 13, 1954. In that
conference he said that the
report was "one of the most
inaccurate" that he had
ever seen.
He said also that the
Hawker Hunter had "prov-
en to be one of the very
excellent fighter intercep-
tors which our Air Force
evaluated as topflight when
it was in the development
stage and it has proven out
in its production."
He said further that
"when we buy airplanes, we
buy only the airplanes that
the U.S. Air Force has
evaluated, and we have
never deviated from that
principle."
Two of the planes in
question are the Hunter and
the Swift. The London
Evening Standard says of
these planes:
"They are obsolescent
compared with the super-
sonic fighters going to the
American Air Force."
W. A. Waterton, a British
test pilot, wrote in the
London Daily Express in
December:
"The new fighters—Hunt-
ers, Swifts and Javelins—
are worrying the RAF...
The Hunter and the Swift
have been produced in hun-
dreds, yet not 20 are in
squadron service... Brit-
ain's new fighters are hav-
ing more than their share
(of troubles). Particularly
as the latest RAF fighters
are already outclassed by
American types in service."

The Senate Appropria-
tions Committee states:
"Three of the fighters
(then being financed by the
U.S.) are unproved planes
still in the experimental
stage and two have never
been fully tested or ap-
proved by the U.S. Air
Force. None of the three
fighters is capable of super-
sonic speed in level flight."
And the report further
states that "if the British
concentrate upon the con-
struction of the Javelin, the
Hawker Hunter and the
Swift, they will not have a
modern fighter force at the
end of four years."
Stassen seems to be in-
censed at the Congress and
presumably at the Hoover
task force for having raised
the question. But here is a
plain question of which is
right, Stassen or those re-
sponsible agencies.
It is hoped that the
Hoover Commission will
give the taxpayers the final
answer on this use of Amer-
ican money and the compe-
tence of this man who is
spending so much of it
abroad.
