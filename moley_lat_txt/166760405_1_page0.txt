SPENDING IN
THE DARK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
At this stage in every
session of Congress, the gov-
ernment of the United
States is conducted in as
dark a well as is that of the
government in the Krem-
lin.
The average citizen, who
in theory and by right can
know all about how his tax
money is being spent, ac-
tually knows little or noth-
ing.
It is due to circumstances
imposed by the vast size of
our government, to the lim-
itations upon the agencies
of news and perhaps most
of all to the limited capaci-
ty of the citizen himself.
★
True, the citizen hears
and reads a great deal. He
gets certain highlights from
his newspapers. He hears
from members of the gov-
ernment through speeches
and press conferences. The
sessions of Congress are
open to him if he chooses
to attend. But the vast busi-
ness of making decisions is
being conducted at this
time of year in scores of
Congressional committees
and subcommittees.
A great many of those
committees are in session
daily. Hundreds of wit-
nesses are being heard. All
sorts of businesses, labor
and farm organizations
and other special-interest
groups are following what
directly concerns them in
the hearings. Then, after
many people have been
heard, the various commit-
tees and subcommittees de-
cide upon a report, and
after a few weeks the print-
ed hearings and reports are
available to those who are
able to get them, either by
purchase or from a Con-
gressman, Senator or ex-
ecutive department.
★
There is no easy remedy
for the citizen who is thus
unable, despite his good in-
tentions, to keep up with
his government. In the last
analysis he must depend
upon representatives in
Congress to protect his in-
terests and keep him fairly
well informed.
He must also depend
upon the working of the
two-party system in which
one party makes decisions
and the other makes criti-
cisms thereof.
But what is he to do in a
case in which both repre-
sentative government and
the two-party system fail to
operate?
*
A perfect example of that
is what has happened in the
case of one of the most im-
mense spending projects
now before Congress, the
Upper Colorado storage
plan.
The cost of this as pre-
sented in Senate Bill 500 is
somewhere between 1 bil-
lion dollars and 1½ billion
dollars. This is the initial
cost, but with interest
charges over a period be-
tween 50 and 100 years it
would run to billions.
The bill was referred to
the Interior Committee of
the Senate, which turned
it over to a subcommittee.
That subcommittee con-
sisted of Sen. Watkins, Mil-
likin, O'Mahoney, Ander-
son, and Jackson. Note that
these are all from the west-
ern half of the country.
Note also that with the
exception of Jackson, all
are not only from the States
which are the chief benefi-
ciaries of the project but al-
so appear as cosponsors of
the very bill over which
they were supposed to sit
in judgment.
★
Jackson is a strong recla-
mation man and presum-
ably has plenty of projects
of his own to promote.
Where, pray tell, are the
representatives of the peo-
ple who are going to be
called upon to pay for this
project? For four States
which are the major bene-
ficiaries of the project are
Utah, Colorado, Wyoming,
and New Mexico repre-
sented, as we see, by four
of the Senators named
above.
The four States named
pay 1.81% of the tax bur-
den of the nation.
Except for Jackson,
whose State pays 1.57%,
the remaining 96.62% of the
nation's out-of-pocket in-
vestment is not represented
at ali.
What was it that the men
of the American Revolution
called "taxation without
representation"?
