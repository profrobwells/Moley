TAXES AND
STOCKS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Senators who are
seeking an explanation of
the high prices of common
stocks might well ponder
this bit of wisdom:
"Why beholdest thou the
mote in thy brother's eye,
but considerest not the
beam in thine own eye?"
A very important reason
why common stocks in a
period like this reach and
remain.at an artifically high
level is the iniquitous cap-
ital gains tax,
The market in shares is
made by an adjustment of
supply and demand. When
demand exceeds supply,
prices go up. When supply
exceeds demand, prices go
down.. But under present
conditions when a man has
bought a stock and that
stock has enjoyed a rise the
owner is penalized if he sells
by a tax on his profit. If a
man under present condi-
tions of prosperity has
bought a stock and that
stock goes down he might,
if his profits from other
sources are high, want to
sell and thus establish a
deductible loss. But Con-
gress has decreed that he
cannot establish such a loss
above $1000. Congress has
in substance established a
rule of "heads I win, tails
you lose."
According to testimony
presented by G. Keith Fun-
ston, president of the New
York Stock Exchange, this
discrimination is not mere-
ly soaking the rich. It hits
the little investor too. He
says that more than 80%
of the people who report
net capital losses and more
than 78% of those who re-
port capital gains have in-
comes under $10,000 a year.
The effect of both rules-
the tax on gains and the
Jimited allowance on losses
--tends to maintain an arti-
ficially high level of prices.
The evil and the danger
of an artificially high price
is not the most objection-
able feature of the tax sys-
tem. It is unfair. Limited
deduction on losses is a
product of the determina-
tion of Congress to get as
much spending money as
possible at the expense of
the smallest number of peo-
ple possible. That is the
way of politics.
â˜…
Congress is responsible
also for in inflation, and a
capital gains tax in a period
of inflation is actually con-
fiscatory. The market price
of investments goes up
without any increase in the
value of the property which
they represent.
For the most part, stock
prices do not exactly follow
the course of inflation. They
follow along after but never
catch up. The man who
buys stock and sells at a
"profit" pays a tax on a fic-
titious gain. There is no
gain at all. There is a loss
in real value and Congress
itself is responsible for that
loss.
This is a condition which
the present investigation
should consider when it is
proposing to free the mar-
ket of all artificial in-
fluences.
