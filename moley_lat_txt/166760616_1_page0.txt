THE AVERY
VICTORY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

There is plenty of food
for thought among respon-
sible people in the business
world in the desperate but
successful fight of Sewell
Avery to retain control of
Montgomery Ward. But be-
fore we come to that, there
are time and reason to sa-
lute the victor.

Sewell Avery is an unre-
constructed conservative.
In the toxic atmosphere of
the last 20-odd years many
strong men have developed
a fear to assert that there
is something to be learned
from history.

It became unfashionable
to be conservative, and con-
servatism itself has been
diluted by qualifying ad-
jectives and phrases. Even
President Eisenhower has
ransacked the book to find
such qualifications.

★

Recently he came up with
"dynamic conservatism,"
which has the happy way of
marching boldly in two di-
rections at once.

Sewell Avery takes his
straight. He believes that
people respond to laws—
old laws made before there
was a Washington. One
such law is that things that
go up come down. Anoth-
er is that people make
darned fools of themselves
when things come easy for
them.

In the minds of men like
Louis Wolfson, Avery
stands convicted of a mor-
tal sin. He remembers.
And because he remembers,
he fears another depression
and so has laid aside a lot
of Ward's money for a rainy
day.

This sort of prudence
runs squarely against an
idea that came into politics
in the 1930s. The "new"
economics holds that thrift
is "antisocial" and that
"dynamism" means taking
chances with the future. In
the words of the "dyna-
mists," we must "face the
future boldly." Along with
this idea went a firm belief
in the effect of money bene-
fits on human beings. Hence
the continuous shower of
Federal checks ever since.
This was supposed to pay
off in votes, regardless of
its effect upon the national
debt and the moral fiber of
the people.

The Wolfsons have ap-
plied this simple rule of
beneficial promises to stock-
holders. Their reward is
not in votes but in proxies.
It's much the same thing.

To make such promises
work, the raiders select
companies with consider-
able reserves. Ward was
ideal for such a raid. It had
a cash reserve of more than
$300,000,000.

Thus, it is not incompe-
tence that attracts raiders
and stirs some stockholders
to want a change. It is com-
petence. It is not failure
but success that is penalized
by a fight for life. This, in-
deed, is reversing the order
of things.

Such raids may well have
serious consequences. They
throw companies into tur-
moil in which investors who
want security and peace are
penalized by the loss of
business. For managers
who are hunting proxies are
not hunting customers.

★

It would seem that stock-
holders who are not satis-
fied with a conservatively
managed company have a
very simple course to take.
They can sell their stock
and put their money in
more "dynamic" companies.

Those who are happy to
have a secure investment
have a right to buy the
stock thus sold by the dis-
satisfied. There are invest-
ors who want risk and there
are people who want se-
curity. That should make
a place for both sorts of
companies.

Ward under Avery repre-
sents conservatism rather
than "dynamism." Surely
there are enough investors
to keep it that way.
