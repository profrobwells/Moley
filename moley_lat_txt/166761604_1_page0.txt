A BRITISH
ELECTION
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The first major decision
of Prime Minister Eden,
to hold an election campaign in May, reflects the
seasoned judgment of a
veteran in politics.
In political life as in war,
the time to press the adversary is when his forces
are disorganized and your
own advantages are reasonably apparent. In these
days international explosions may upset the best of
calculations, and to wait
until October might be fatal
to the Conservatives.
The Conservative advantages are the high rate of
economic recovery attained
during the last four years,
and the public recognition
that wise financial management by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer has a great
deal to do with it. The Conservative Party moved
boldly and successfully to
unscramble the steel industry which had been partially
nationalized by the
Socialists.
Meanwhile, in the last
few years more and more
promising young leaders
appeared in the Conservative Party, while the "party
of the future," Labor, presented the same old, tired
faces. The local elections
and the Parliamentary by-
elections offer evidence that
the voters like the Conservative Party better than
they used to.
Much has been made of
the split in the Labor Party
caused by the bitter rivalry
between Aneurin Bevan
and Attlee and Morrison.
This may appreciably affect
the result, but we in the
United States have seen allegedly split parties do well
at election time. The Bevanites will be out there
hammering away at the
Conservatives, just as they
have been before.

I have formerly reported
in these articles the impressions of a British election
in the eyes of an American observer on the scene
of action, and I expect to
do so this time. I shall
therefore spend the month
of May in British constituencies, watching the most
efficient politicians in the
world in action.
When I go, however, it
will be with two fundamentals in mind which it
would be easy for an observer to neglect.
The first is favorable to
the Conservative cause. It is
this: Never overestimate the
tendency of voters to
prefer the most colorful candidate. A man can be brilliant, famous and tested by
performing many years before the public, but still fail
to win votes.
★
On the other hand, a candidate not favored by fortune with eloquence or
sharpness of wit may be a
tremendous vote-getter. For
that reason, the fact that
the brilliant Churchill has
stepped aside for the rather
conventional Eden may well
attract rather than lose Conservative votes.
My other fundamental is
that the result of an election must never be taken
for granted. The experienced politician never relaxes his efforts until the
last vote is cast.
All the omens favor the
Conservatives this time, but
the omens may be mocking
the confidence of frail human beings.
★
There is, moreover, a substantial reason why Labor
may hold most of the
strength it now has in Parliament. It swept into office
in 1945 with a big majority
based, it was thought, on
war weariness. In 1950 normal balance was restored,
But in seeking to appraise
the result before the election in 1951, it became apparent to me that most of
the big shift in 1950 was
merely a recovery by the
Conservatives of seats that
were normally Conservative.
This was proved by the results. Hence, the score may
be close because after a
certain number of gains, the
winning of the opposition's
districts may be very difficult.
In any event, such an election will be worth watching,
and I shall enjoy being present.
