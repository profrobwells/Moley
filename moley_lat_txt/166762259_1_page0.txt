Republican strategists at
the national level were
shocked after last year's
election to realize that Sen.
Homer Ferguson of Michi-
gan, a top leader of their
party, had been beaten by
a political unknown, Pat
McNamara.
Slowly the grim fact
dawned upon them that the
CIO through its Political
Action Committee had cre-
ated a machine of such effi-
ciency and financial re-
sources that the Repub-
lican Party had lost its as-
cendancy in one of its most
dependable States.
The PAC makes no se-
cret of its methods or its ul-
timate purpose. Recently,
in an interview, published
in the Detroit Free Press,
August Scholle, president
of the Michigan CIO Coun-
cil and chairman of the
PAC, explained his organi-
zation in detail.
★
The PAC, he said, is a na-
tional organization with
Jack Kroll as its director,
operating in Washington.
Walter Reuther is the chair-
man of its directing com-
mittee.
In Michigan there is a
State PAC committee with
representatives from every
international CIO union,
the State CIO Council ex-
ecutive board, top United
Auto Workers officers and
a separate representative
from each Congressional
district. Thus, the PAC is
the CIO and the CIO is the
PAC.
But Scholle hastened to
say that there was nothing
compulsory about the re-
lationship between the un-
ion and the political organi-
zation. However, he added
that "the workers who ring
doorbells and pass out lit-
erature are chosen by the
local union."
Anyone who knows poli-
tics knows that when you
have said that, you have ad-
mitted that the local union
chooses the people who do
50% of the work of the po-
litical organization. The
character of the candidate
is even less important, but
that choice is made for the
membership by the top
brass of the PAC, which
really means the CIO.
The other considerable el-
ement is the money needed
in campaigns. That, accord-
ing to Scholle, comes "from
voluntary subscriptions and
from the local unions." The
unions give the money if
approved by the member-
ship.
And the choice is limited
to the Democratic Party.
Scholle said: "We decided
on a policy of working with-
in the framework of the
Democratic Party."
Thus the CIO dominates
the PAC, chooses its govern-
ing board and committees,
provides money and decides
which party it will support.
And since the objective
of the CIO is compulsory
union membership, there
must follow compulsory
party membership and sup-
port, financial and other-
wise.
A very interesting bill
has been introduced in the
Michigan Legislature. It is
not a right-to-work bill. It
simply provides that "no
candidate or political com-
mittee shall accept or spend
any money obtained
from ... any organization
which any person is re-
quired, as a condition of
employment, to join, remain
in, or support financially or
otherwise." Thus it says to
unions that if they want to
have compulsory member-
ship they must get out of
politics. The Michigan CIO
is greatly stirred up over
this bill. For if it passes it
must go to Gov. Williams.
The Governor, who is dom-
inated by the unions, will
be compelled to veto it.
★
That will in substance
put him on record as sup-
porting the principle that
a worker must as the price
of his very livelihood be-
long to and support a spe-
cific party which someone
else has chosen for him.
The moral of all this is
clear. There is no such
thing as political freedom
when economic freedom is
surrendered to the bosses of
a union.
Either the unions must
really get out of politics or
suffer the regulations that
a wise government must
impose to maintain political
freedom.
