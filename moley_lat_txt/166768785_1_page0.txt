LONDON — It would be
rash to say that the British
gift of oratory is in a per-
manent decline.
Let us say, rather, that in
this campaign it is not note-
worthy. One of the reasons
for this is the stiff and col-
orless platform perform-
ance of the two party lead-
ers. Another is the prosaic
character of the issues. Per-
haps in the future the art
graced by Burke, O'Connell,
Gladstone, Disraeli and
Churchill will revive, but
for the time being the ora-
torical fare resembles the
shrunken festive board of
the war years.
It is an understatement
to say that the new Prime
Minister is no orator. He is
a very poor speaker indeed.
Even among his very own
people in his constituency
in Warwick, where I saw
him accept adoption as its
candidate for the seventh
time, his warmth ascended
to only about 50 deg. Fahr-
enheit.

To begin with, it is hard
to understand him. He
speaks with the burr so
common among the lesser
actors of even the best
British troupes. His selec-
tion of words and phrases
runs wholly to the cliche
and the well worn. His ges-
tures are a mechanical saw-
ing of the arms up and
down, left and right.
All his undubitable man-
ly beauty is horribly wasted
by the colorless spirit in-
side. Sir Anthony is not a
weak man, but he will nev-
er innovate.
Harold Macmillan in his
first television performance
brought the news from Par-
is which may win the Brit-
ish election—that of Eisen-
hower's willingness to talk
at the summit. Macmillan's
manner, however, suggest-
ed that he was more anx-
ious to catch the plane back
to Paris than to make polit-
ical capital of his message.

Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer Butler is enormous-
ly respected, and his meet-
ings are largely attended.
He has some of the awe-
some prestige of a man
who touched the prostrate
British economy and
brought it leaping to its
feet.
The bleak Attlee is driven
over the countryside in an
austere car by his wife and
drones the old story of a
planned economy without
the loss of liberty and with
plenty sometime in the fu-
ture. His followers can do
nothing but advertise him
as a safe man—a strange
role for a revolutionist.
Herbert Morrison is lik-
able and bluff. His common
sense is admirable, but he
speaks to small crowds.
★
The most interesting of
all is the maker of mischief,
Aneurin Bevan.
He really puts on a show
and packs the rather small
halls to which the jealous
management of the Labor
Party consigns him. He calls
names and fights with
hecklers.
Bevan is a big, beefy man
with the rather high, clear
voice that often goes with
excess poundage. His sallies
with those who try to dis-
turb his meetings are rough
rather than clever, but they
delight his audience. The
newspapers, starving for
something to print in this
campaign, give Bevan a big
daily play, which, of course,
irritates his enemies in the
Labor Party.
An example or two will
illustrate his nightly bat-
tles. He shouted at one in-
terruption: "Don't be a fat-
head!" At another: "Try to
restrain your suicidal im-
pulses." And to a bunch of
young Conservatives: "You
are just a bunch of robots."
Again: "There is something
wrong with your throat."
★
He has already said in ef-
fect that a man cannot be
a Tory and a Christian and
that the Tories are Qada-
rene swine. These hammer
blows are understandable,
they amuse his audiences
and they get him publicity
in all the papers.
Of the impact of televi-
sion, I shall have something
to say in a later article. So
far, however, it seems to be
an instrument which the
parties are unable to use
with much effect.
