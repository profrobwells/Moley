Apparently the attack by
Sen. Byrd (D) Va., on the
highway building program
proposed by Gen. Clay's
committee was a mortal
blow. No one suggests that
this strange combination of
deceptive financing and
wholesale Federal spending
has a chance for passage
this year or in the future.
This offers the Democratic
majority in Congress an
opportunity to press for a
program of its own, and
Sen. Gore seems to be the
sponsor for such a plan.
The Gore bill was passed
by a subcommittee and it is
likely that the full Senate
Public Works Committee
will send the measure to the
Senate floor.
★
The best that can be said
for the Gore plan is that
it is not quite so bad as the
Clay program. Both, however,
would impose a new and
excessive charge upon the
budget and probably destroy
the chance for the next few
years to bring about a
balance between receipts and
expenditures.
In considering either
plan, the citizens must note
the distinction between expenditures
for "interstate" highways
and "primary, secondary and
urban" roads.
It seems to be assumed in
both plans that "interstate"
roads are the major responsibility
of the Federal government,
which under the Clay plan
would provide 60% of the cost
and under the Gore plan, 75%.
For "primary, secondary and
urban" roads, there is the
old formula for 50-50 Federal-
State matching.
Gore would spend $1,
500,000,000 a year for five
years compared with $176,
000,000 now, on "interstate"
former and $1,000,000,000
on the latter.
The increase in cost to
the Federal taxpayer for all
sorts of highways and roads
would be $1,325,000,000 on
"interstate" highways and
$475,000,000 on "primary,
secondary and urban" roads
or a total additional burden
on the Federal budget of
$1,800,000,000.
But the Gore bill would add
1 cent to the Federal gasoline
tax, which it is estimated
would bring in $6,500,000.
Thus, there would be required
from other taxes $1,150,000,000.
Byrd's solution to the
highway building problem,
which he offered when he
criticized the Clay plan, would
be to repeal the Federal
gasoline tax entirely, which
would permit the States to
add 2 cents to their own
gasoline tax. They could then
have upward of a billion
dollars additional for their own
building. Byrd would also
continue matching as at present,
with an annual Federal outlay
of $535,000,000.
★
The Gore plan would also
push the Federal government
further into the regulation of
highways because it would
impose a Federal weight limit
upon vehicles using highways
and roads built in part with
Federal money.
The most serious feature of
the Gore plan is that instead
of moving toward giving back
to the States their lost sources
of taxation, it would push the
Federal government further in
the direction it has been going
for many years.
The President's Commission
on Intergovernmental Relations,
which has a report not yet made
public on this subject and which
was created to try to stop the
encroachment of the Federal
government on the States, is
ignored by both the Clay and
Gore plans. That is the beginning
to seem that the President wisely
abandoned his commission, as
well as the Hoover group.
