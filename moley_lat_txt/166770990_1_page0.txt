HOOVER, THE MYTH AND THE MAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On July 1 Herbert Hoover
will once more be entirely
a private citizen. The pub-
lic service bestowed upon
him by Congress and the
President, to examine our
vast governmental estab-
lishment, will have ex-
pired.
The reports of the com-
mission which he has
headed will officially be in
the hands of Congress and
available to the executive
departments concerned.
Theoretically, the vener-
able ex-President with his
81st birthday approaching
may go fishing or fold his
hands. It is a safe assump-
tion that he will not be
idle, and if he seeks recrea-
tion it will be with people
who have the capacity to
stimulate into activity the
remarkably clear mind and
solid character which has
carried him so far.
*
Action on the many rec-
ommendations of the com-
mission are now up to Con-
gress, the President and his
department heads.
It is the hope of Hoover
himself that as good a rec-
ord of adoption will attend
this batch of recommenda-
tions as was established aft-
er the submission of the re-
ports of the former commis-
sion five years ago. In those
five years 70% of the sug-
gestions were adopted. A
similar record would be a
gratifying result.
There are, to be sure,
great differences in the im-
portance of the recommen-
dations. It would be pos-
sible to get agreement on
70% and not really touch
the big problems raised by
the other 30%. To some
degree that happened with
the reports five years ago.
Neither the politicians in
Congress nor the bureau-
crats in their official fox-
holes are willing to surren-
der their power without re-
sistance.
The job will take a whale
of a lot of public education.
But Hoover has produced
the material for that in am-
ple amount. The commis-
sion reports, with the basic
materials in the reports of
20 task forces, in the aggre-
gate constitute the most
colossal treatise on modern
government ever written.
*
I regard the task force as
much more important than
the official reports of the
commission. For the 400
executive and professional
people who manned the
task forces represent a very
important part of the brains
of the nation.
The commission reports
are restricted to what the
chairman was able to get
through a variegated com-
mission, with one Democrat
who represented implacable
opposition to change, some
Democrats like Joseph P.
Kennedy whose conserva-
tism supported the chair-
man when even the Eisen-
hower department heads
were in opposition, and a
small minority of Republi-
cans who supported the
Hoover point of view all the
way.
The net of it is that bil-
lions can be saved and la-
mentable policies can be
abandoned if a strong pub-
lic opinion can be sum-
moned to the support of the
basic philosophy of the task
force reports.
There will be demagogues
who will be incensed by
the reports on such contro-
versial subjects as govern-
ment in business, the lend-
ing agencies, and public
power.
These people will sense
the possibility of a cam-
paign in 1956 against Her-
bert Hoover rather than
against the official candi-
date. But the imprint made
by the ex-President on the
government affairs of his
time will outlive all such
political attacks.
No one could have done
this job as has Herbert
Hoover. Even if he had
been no more than the pri-
vate citizen who went
through the labors of the
former commission, his
qualifications would have
been unparalleled.
*
But he was equipped
with the vast experience of
a former President and
Cabinet officer with eight
years of service. He was
also a man of business who
was able to retire and de-
vote himself to public serv-
ice at the age of 40.
Beyond all that, there was
his philosophy, deeply en-
trenched in his belief in
freedom, both political and
economic.
This extraordinary man
has established a standard
to which Americans can re-
pair. They will do so if they
are at once wise and devot-
ed to the cause of sound
government.
