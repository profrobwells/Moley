LONDON—In some ways
legal restrictions on the
spending of money in elec-
tions are more severe in
Britain than in the United
States. But in one respect
there is an amazing dif-
ference over here. The par-
ties are not compelled to
publish an accounting of
how their money is raised
and how it is spent.
After a great deal of ar-
gument when the Conserva-
tive Party was reorganized
in the years between its de-
feat in 1945 and the begin-
ning of its revival in 1950,
it was decided that the
party would not make its
account public.
★
The Conservative Party,
in extenuation of keeping
its accounts secret, said that
its opposition, the Labor
Party, enjoys the benefits
of many movements and
organizations which carry
on Socialist propaganda
whose finances are not in-
cluded in the expenses of
the Labor Party as a party.
The amount of such money
spent in furthering the
ideas of Socialism was esti-
mated by the Conserva-
tives at 1,000,000 pounds a
year.
In reply to this, it might
be said that on the side of
free enterprise great sums
are spent which are not in-
cluded in Conservative
Party accounts. It would
seem that the reckoning on
this score is about even,
just as it is in the United
States.
On the other hand, the
Labor Party of its own
choice publishes full ac-
counts of its financial trans-
actions. This may be be-
cause so large a part of its
money comes from trade
unions, the members of
which have a definite in-
terest in knowing how the
politicians are spending
their contributions.
It was reported that for
the year 1952 there was a
balance in the treasury of
300,000 pounds. In that year
the trade unions contribut-
ed 126,000 pounds to the
party, and individuals gave
only 27,000 pounds.
To a large degree, the
party operation on a year-
round basis must be run in
the constituencies out of
these individual subscrip-
tions. The professional paid
agent must, as the British
say, "scrounge" around to
raise money to pay his own
salary, small as it is, and
the upkeep of his small of-
fice. He does this by organ-
izing social affairs such as
picnics, musical programs
and the like.

The rules provide that
the trade unions support
the party by grants from
the federations. But this
money is raised within the
unions by asking for con-
tributions from union mem-
bers. The amounts given
and the regularity of pay-
ments must in Britain be
nominally voluntary. On
this point there are specific
laws enacted by Parlia-
ment.
Nevertheless, despite the
lack of compulsory account-
ing by the parties, it is evi-
dent that the Conservatives
are getting and spending a
great deal more than Labor.
