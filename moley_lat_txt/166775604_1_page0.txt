THE COURT
LEARNS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The only surprising thing
about the decision of the
Supreme Court to remand
the segregation cases before
it to the lower courts is
that it did not occur to the
learned justices to make
that determination a year
ago.
If they were truly anxious
to have the problem solved
over a period of time, they
might have shortened the
process by 12 months. It
has been obvious to perceptive
Southerners for a long
time that the course now
announced is the only way
in which the Supreme Court
could possibly extract itself
from the position in which
it found itself after deciding
to reverse the constitutional
interpretation which
had stood for so many
years.
Perhaps, however, the
court failed to understand a
year ago what practical
problems would be raised
by its action. In that case,
it has needed education,
and education takes time.
*
One of the justices, the
late Robert Jackson, saw a
glimpse of the problems
raised by desegregation
when he said, during the
trial of the case, that a
decision against segregation
would involve a generation
of litigation. It was Jackson
also who asked the government’s
attorney in the trial
what he would propose as a
method of enforcing a
favorable decision. The
lawyer was unable to
answer. Thus, the Department
of Justice itself had
pushed itself into litigation
the consequences of which
it could not foresee.
At any rate, young
lawyers of both races who
are looking for full employment
for life might well
consider specializing in
segregation litigation. For to
square the law with the
facts without provoking
bitter conflict will require
plans fitted to the situations
prevailing in literally
thousands of local communities.
Anticipating this decision,
States have adopted a policy
which is called “fragmentation.”
That means scattering
responsibility for the
public schools among the
many districts. There are
102 such districts in South
Carolina, and 174 in North
Carolina.
★
Such cases will be heard
in the Federal District
Courts with jurisdiction
over such school districts.
If the district judge so decrees,
the finding in an individual
case may be applied to all the
school districts in the judicial
district.
Thus a heavy responsibility
will fall upon the Federal
judges in the States
involved. Those judges
have been appointed generally
on the nomination
and approval of the Senators
from the respective
States. Hence, they may be
expected to be in sympathy
with the prevailing
opinion in their States.
In short, the problem will
be solved, if it can be
solved, by the States concerned.
That is as it should
be.
In the decision a year ago
the Chief Justice moved
away from the strict law to
various psychological and
sociological factors affecting
the Negroes. It was
basic in his opinion that if
Negro children were compelled
to go to separate
schools it would have an
unfortunate effect upon
their psychology throughout
their lives.
In the present decision
the Chief Justice seems to
recognize that the other
people of the South have
their psychological problems,
too, and that the customs
and conditions which
prevail must be taken into
consideration in running
their schools.
This is a point which
should be pondered by
those people in the North
who have hitherto assumed
that desegregation could be
accomplished overnight.
Those people might also be
well advised to understand
that in the long process of
developing satisfactory
school conditions where
there are problems of race
and of religion, the public
should be patient, allowing
time to reconcile with various
religious views like the
North.
It is a problem for the
public, for the South, to
work out.
