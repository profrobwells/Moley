FROM POLIO
TO MS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Every great battle. won
by science against one dis-
ease offers hope and cheer
for those engaged in the
war against every other
physical affliction.
The news of the Salk vac-
cine for the prevention of
polio is tidings of joy not
only to every parent of a
child who might be a victim
of that disease but to suffer-
ers from kindred diseases
and those concerned in
fighting them.
Multiple sclerosis is, like
polio, a malady affecting
the central nervous system.
Its essential nature is even
more terrible than polio, be-
cause while the attack of
the latter is swift and crip-
pling, that of the former is
insidious in its approach
and progressive in its at-
tack. With most cases of po-
lio the victim, like the late
President Roosevelt, may
settle for what he has lost
in the initial attack. But the
person who contracts MS is
doomed to years of progres-
sive loss of his physical
faculties and ultimate utter
paralysis.

The Salk discovery offers
hope that there may some-
time be found a vaccine for
other nerve diseases, such
as MS.
Of equal or more impor-
tance is the fact that since
polio is now practically re-
duced to a problem of pre-
vention, the need for exten-
sive and costly research
will be less and money now
spent on that can be used
for the attack on the great
unknowns of other diseases.
MS certainly deserves
'plenty of that money. It is,
considering its prevalence
and its devastating nature,
the most serious of the
nerve diseases after polio.
Parkinson's disease and epi-
lepsy are possibly more
prevalent, but the latter is
not so crippling on its onset,
and the former is confined
to those late in life.
Knowledge concern-
ing multiple sclerosis is
still primitive. It is known
that it consists of the disso-
lution of the sheath or in-
sulation that surrounds the
nerve fibers. The result, in
nonmedical terms, is similar
to a short circuit. There fol-
lows a whole series of
symptoms such as stagger-
ing, speech difficulties,
double vision, tremor, emo-
tional disturbances and
loss of the functioning of
internal organs.

MS strikes here and there
with utterly unpredictable
terror. Sometimes it will
seem to go away complete-
ly for a long time, perhaps
for years. These temporary
recoveries are called remis-
sions, but they can never be
depended upon to last. The
disease does not kill ex-
cept over a long period of
years. It hits people general-
ly in the age group from 30
to 45.
There is no certain knowl-
edge of its cause, treat-
ment, or even diagnosis.
Everything about it needs
to be discovered by the ef-
forts of science. Even its
prevalence is speculative,
because of the difficulty of
diagnosis. But a fair esti-
mate is that more than a
quarter of a million are
known and identified cases.
This is almost as great a
number as that of the vic-
tims of polio.
There are many theories
of the cause of MS. One is
that it may be a virus or a
tiny thing called a spiro-
chete. Another is that it is
due to faulty metabolism.
Another would attribute it
to a nutritional deficiency.
Another, an allergy. All
these theories and more are
being investigated so far as
is possible with the scanty
funds available. It must be
that way with science-trial
and error, and following up
every theory to the end.

The funds available since
the war on the disease was
started in 1947 have been
only about $1,500,000. By
way of comparison, it
should be noted that the
United States Department
of Agriculture spent $63,-
545,000 last year for the con-
trol of plant and animal
diseases.
The National Multiple
Sclerosis Society is the cen-
tral agency in the fight
against MS. It has chapters
in many cities. Its address
is 270 Park Ave., New York
17, N.Y. It needs money in
all amounts in its current
campaign.
