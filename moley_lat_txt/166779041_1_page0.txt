IS INFLATION GOOD POLITICS?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
George Magoffin Hum-
phrey, Secretary of the
Treasury, is said to have
come to Washington in high
hopes that the Federal
budget could be balanced,
inflation stopped, and a pol-
icy of sound money estab-
lished by the administra-
tion of which he became a
member.
Before many months he
deservedly came to be rec-
ognized as not only the
most popular but one of the
two ablest members of the
Eisenhower Cabinet. It
must, however, have been
a keen disappointment to
him to see budget after
budget presented and still
no balance.
It must be with even
more keen regret that he
can see no prospects ahead
for a balanced budget.
And it must disturb him
to read and hear govern-
ment economists who have
the ear of the President
give utterance to a theory
that spending must go on,
not because the things for
which Federal money is
spent are all essential but
because spending keeps
men in jobs and prevents
a rise in unemployment.

For such economic theo-
ry is essentially that which
was the fashion in Wash-
ington during the 20 years
before the present adminis-
tration took office.
However, like a good
soldier, Secretary Hum-
phrey utters no regrets and
loyally goes to Congress
from time to time asking
that the debt limit be
raised.
The real crux of the mat-
ter is in the assertion of
the said government econ-
omists that political consid-
erations make a balanced
budget inexpedient and in-
flation inevitable. These
economists are not hired
for their knowledge of poli-
tics.
Indeed, they know very
little of politics, and I be-
gin to believe that they
know little of history. But
they are, as I say, basing
their entire thesis not on an
economic but a political
conclusion.
It is time to challenge
this assumption of political
It was the fashion among
all and sundry pundits and
politicians in 1896 to say
that monetary inflation was
politically necessary and
that no candidate for Pres-
ident could be elected on a
platform of sound money.
Over the length and
breadth of the land, except
in certain quarters of the
East and Northeast, it was
said that salvation could
come only through the
adoption of bimetalism.
Even McKinley, who was
Hanna's choice for the nom-
ination, had a wobbly record
on the subject.
*
Hanna kept his own coun-
sel, but when the chips
were down and a platform
had to be adopted, he
caused it to say unequivo-
cally that the Republican
Party stood for sound
money. And McKinley
bowed to Hanna's judgment
and made his campaign on
that principle. No calamity
followed. The people elected
McKinley and prosperity
followed.
Another President came
from Ohio who heard the
siren songs of inflation,
Rutherford B. Hayes. He
stood like a rock against
the soft-money boys and
saw himself vindicated by
events.
Oh, yes, the economic ex-
perts who think they know
politics will say that things
are different now.
They are different only in
the fact that we had admin-
istrations in 1897 and 1877
that made people realize
that they, the people—all
the people—are always bet-
ter off without inflation.
For inflation ultimately
profits no one.

omniscience by the masters
of the dismal science of
economics. No one is in a
better position to cite some
historical and common-
sense facts than Secretary
Humphrey himself.
For George Humphrey,
before he came to Washing-
ton, presided over the af-
fairs of a great company
bearing the name of a man
who was not only a great
businessman but the ablest
politician of his time, Mar-
cus A. Hanna.
