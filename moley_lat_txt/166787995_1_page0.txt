RAYMOND MOLEY:
Hoover Power Report;
Two Kinds of Citizens
It is appropriate that the
most controversial as well
as the most important of the
Hoover Commission reports
should come at the end of its
labors.
By a bare majority of the
commission and attended
by a bitter dissent from
Congressman Holifield, a
public power zealot, Her-
bert Hoover has presented
to the country a powerful
case for the checking and
regulation of a Federal mo-
nopoly which might well be-
come a major threat to a
free economy. Socialists
have always held that with
the control of electric power
in the hands of government
all else will be at its mercy.
*
It was clearly within the
mandate of the commission
to consider and render a
judgment upon this basic
issue. The act creating the
commission instructed it to
study and make recommen-
dations concerning the elim-
ination of "activities which
are competitive with pri-
vate enterprise." If ever
there was a Federal activi-
ty which competes with pri-
vate business, it is this one.
When F.D.R. proposed
the establishment of the
TVA in 1933, the Federal
government was producing
only 0.7% of the electric
power of the nation.
Twenty years later its
share was 12.4%. When the
present authorized program
is completed the percentage
will be 17. When that figure
has been attained the Fed-
eral investment will be
$9,662,206,545. This makes
Uncle Sam by all odds the
largest single producer in
the nation.
*
The commission report
sets forth the task force's
criteria for determining the
financial results of Federal
enterprises. Among these
is provision for the return
of the Federal investment
to the Treasury, with in-
terest at 3% of the total in-
vestment, for hydroelectric
plants within 50 years and
for steam plants in 35 years.
Included in the capital
costs should be all items
involved in planning and
construction, and provision
for replacement during
amortization periods. Proj-
ects should also pay State
and local taxes, and their
bookkeeping should in-
clude the amount they
would have to pay in Fed-
eral taxes if they were pri-
vately owned.
That these sound stand-
ards of economic justifica-
tion are not observed is
shown by a tabular state-
ment of what the seven
major Federal systems
have been short in reve-
nues. That amount is $331,-
591.045—a plain subsidy
paid by all the taxpayers
for the benefit of 10% of
the taxpayers.
One of the most unfair
aspects of Federal power
development is the "prefer-
ence clause." This provides
that in the sale of Federal
power preference shall be
given to public power agen-
cies and co-operatives. This
preference, according to the
report, means that two
classes of citizens are creat-
ed—those who get electric-
ity at less than cost, and
those who pay for it at full
prices to private companies.
To compound the unfair-
ness the citizens who pay a
fair price are taxed to pro-
vide the cut price for their
fellow Americans. After all,
they are all the same sort of
people, but the public power
zealots seem to think that
the customers of public
power agencies have some
superior moral right to an
economic advantage.
★
The recommendations of
the commission are too
lengthy to be given here.
Their purpose is to correct
the inequities now prevail-
ing, to get the States and
local agencies into the pic-
ture, to require the various
Federal power agencies to
be incorporated under the
Government Corpora-
tion Control Act, to permit
private capital to build the
power facilities in multiple-
purpose installations and to
sell the power therefrom at
rates determined by the
Federal Power Commission.
The report and these rec-
ommendations will be vio-
lently assailed by the
politicians who hope to win
the next election on this
issue. For the power issue
will be dominant in the very
States next year in which
the control of the Senate
will be determined.
However, in States that
receive no Federal power
but through their taxes pay
the huge subsidies that go
to the favored 10%, the
Hoover report will have
much to commend it.
