UNREVISED
TORY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
TORONTO—It has been
said with a great deal of ac-
curacy that, while the late
Mackenzie King was the
Franklin D. Roosevelt of
Canada, its Herbert Hoover
is Arthur Meighen, twice
Prime Minister and twice
leader of the Conservative
Party.
Since the present Pro-
gressive Conservatives of
George Drew are not alto-
gether conservative, and
the liberals of Louis
Stephen St. Laurent are
proving to be not altogether
liberal, I sought a key to
Canada's general conserva-
tive temper in Meighen,
whose views, as he once
proudly announced, are
"unrevised and unrepent-
ed."
*
Like Herbert Hoover,
this grand old man of Can-
ada celebrates his 81st
birthday this summer. Like
Hoover, too, he has won re-
spect over the years since
his party's defeat. Like
Hoover, his conservatism is
deeply embedded in a pro-
found respect for the con-
stitution and other political
institutions of his country.
But despite the four tur-
bulent years which Hoover
experienced in the White
House, his public life was
marked by only one defeat.
Meighen has known many.
He was first elected to the
Canadian House of Com-
mons nearly 50 years ago
from a constituency in
Manitoba.
*
Sir Robert Borden, Prime
Minister and Conservative
leader in the first world
war, brought Meighen into
the Ministry, and on Bor-
den's retirement in 1920
Meighen assumed his place
as Prime Minister and par-
ty leader.
From then for many
years Meighen was the
leading political opponent
of the perennially success-
ful Mackenzie King. Final-
ly, after a Conservative,
R. B. Bennett, succeeded in
getting King out of power,
Meighen in 1932 was made
a Senator, which is usually
a sign of retirement from
active politics. But Bennett,
after his defeat by King in
1935, decided to move to
England and Meighen
was summoned once more
to the leadership of the
Conservatives.
*
In 1942 he retired and
was succeeded by John
Bracken, who was at the
time head of a party called
"Progressive" but which
espoused very conservative
policies. It is because of the
merger of two parties and
not because of a desire to
get votes from both sides
of the political street that
the present Conservatives
are called Progressive Con-
servatives.
In the confusion party
labels and basic principles
were no longer related to
each other, and only a few
firm believers like Meighen
continued to express a con-
sistent philosophy.
*
There have been few
more eloquent expressions
of the conservative faith
than a speech on Socialism
by Meighen in 1943 which
is published in a book of his
speeches under the name
"Unrevised and Unre-
pented." He said:
"Which system do you
think is going to make the
strong and self-reliant man
—the system under which
the state takes charge, or
the system under which he
takes charge himself . . .
rivalry and struggle under
equitable laws are the
laws of living. Men become
strong by defying defeat, by
grasping the skirts of hap-
py chance and beating back
the blows of circumstance,
by cheering in the face of
discouragement and shak-
ing off the lure of inauspi-
cious stars, by steering for
the lights ahead, turning
loss to gain and failure to
success."
This, some of us will say,
is old-fashioned falderal.
Perhaps that is what most
voters will say. But the
steady drift of all Canadian
parties toward conservative
policies, despite the radical
names that some of them
bear, is proof of the perma-
nent value of the uncom-
promising philosophy of
men like Arthur Meighen.
