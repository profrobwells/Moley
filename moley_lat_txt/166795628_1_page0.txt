THE SILENT
TAXPAYER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the report of the first
Hoover Commission six
years ago there was a strong
recommendation that an in-
dependent technical board
should be set up to provide
Congress and the public
with reliable figures on all
reclamation projects.
This recommendation was
based upon the obvious fact
that the Department of the
Interior and its Bureau of
Reclamation is a party of
interest which, like all
bureaucracies, is intent up-
on getting as much money
as possible from Congress
and thus building its power
more and more.
In the midst of a mad
jumble of engineering and
accounting facts and fig-
ures the Senate passed an
Upper Colorado storage bill
in April which called for
an initial expenditure of
$1,600,000,000, an increase
of more than $600,000,000
over the original plan sub-
mitted by the President in
1954.
★
The project then went to
the House Interior and In-
sular Affairs Committee,
which is in executive ses-
sion this week, apparently
rewriting the bill.
No one can tell what the
Interior Committee will rec-
ommend, but it is now ru-
mored that the proponents
of the bill, including the
Senators and Congressmen
from the arid States work-
ing with the Interior De-
partment, will eliminate the
Echo Park Dam from the
project.
This move, it is hoped,
will lead the conservation-
ists, who all along have
fought the invasion of the
Dinosaur National Monu-
ment, to lessen their opposi-
tion. If that can be accom-
plished, the conference
agreement with the Senate
will restore the Echo Park
feature, and in the final
rush at the end of the ses-
sion get through the two
houses exactly what the in-
terested parties want.
Meanwhile, the Bureau of
Reclamation has loosed its
heaviest propaganda guns
at those who have opposed
this measure and who have
presented the cold facts con-
cerning it.
★
What happens is that the
Bureau of Reclamation pre-
pares the broadsides with,
in at least one instance, the
name of Commissioner Dex-
heimer attached, and then
some Congressman or Sena-
tor slaps the material into
the Congressional Record.
In the release to which I
refer from Dexheimer the
main object of attack is for-
mer Gov. Leslie Miller of
Wyoming. In addition to
Gov. Miller I am brought
into the picture because of
various articles I have writ-
ten.
It is difficult for either
Gov. Miller or me to keep
up with this propaganda be-
cause the bureau and the
Senators have unlimited
taxpayers' money to use in
their attack.
I shall, therefore, not try
to answer the multitudinous
data presented by the Com-
missioner but merely note
here for such taxpayers as
may wish to take note some
incontrovertible facts:
The Tax Foundation, us-
ing government income tax
figures, has compiled the
percentages of the total tax
intake which are collected
in each of the 48 States.
★
With those percentages I
am able to present the cost
of the Upper Colorado proj-
ect to a number of selected
states. Ohio, for example,
bears 5.9% of the Federal
tax load. It would there-
fore pay $94,400,000 of the
$1,600,000,000 initial
cost. But the hidden inter-
est subsidy on the project
would be one billion dollars,
which would bring the Ohio
cost to $154,400,000.
Any taxpayer in Pennsyl-
vania may, if he chooses,
calculate his cost because
his State pays 0.84% of the
Federal tax burden. Cali-
fornia pays 9.33% and Illi-
nois 8.0%.
The recommendation of
the first Hoover Commission
that there be an independ-
ent technical board to guide
Congress in matters such as
this was ignored. The re-
sult has been legislation in
a darkness illuminated only
by the treacherous flashes
of light from the interests
involved in spending more
and more of the public mon-
ey.
