The most lasting lesson
which I can extract from
my 22 days on the scene of
the British election can, I
believe, be profitably pondered
by every American
interested in the success of
conservative principles,
whether he is a Democrat
in the South or a Republican
in the North. Curiously
enough, it was brought
forcibly to my mind by an
official of the Labor Party
with whom I talked in
Bristol.
I mentioned to him my
observation, not only in the
recent campaign but in 1950,
that the Conservative
Party had much the better
organization, in the constituencies
as well as in the
London central office.
It was a puzzle to me, in
fact, how the Labor Party
could, as it had up to that
time since the war, polled
more votes over the nation
than the Conservatives.
"Your observation is correct,"
he said, "we have
barely enough money to
make an effective fight for
votes in less than half the
constituencies. In fact, in 300
of them we have no paid,
year-round agent at all. In
this campaign we must concentrate
on the marginal
seats. Things must pretty
much go as they can in
places where either Labor
or the Conservatives have
big majorities.
"Our appeal is to people
in the mass. We rely upon
the solidarity of working
men and women and their
families, gathering if we can
a few more from the intellectuals
or upper classes."
"You are therefore," I replied,
"a class partyâ€”
representing essentially one
class."
"Yes, that is substantially
true. And because we get
votes wholesale we need
less organization to appeal
to the individual than do
the Conservatives. It takes
a lot of money and a lot of
canvassers in a typical constituency
to reach, in a short
three-week campaign, any
large part of 30,000 to 50,000
electors. That is why the
Conservatives must have
twice or three times the
organization that we need
to get approximately the
same number of votes."
The result of the election
shows how true his observations
proved to be. I had it
from another Labor official
in a safe Labor constituency
that he expected to lose
2000 votes compared with
1951. With this figure in
mind I tried to figure out
the probable result.
I found that in the 1951
election Labor had won 32
seats with majorities of less
than 2000. The Conservative
margin over Labor in that
election was 26 seats. If the
loss of 2000 per constituency
were to prevail over the
entire country, the margin
in the new 1955 House
would be twice 32 plus 26 or
90.
As I wrote one of these
articles I put down 90 as a
possible Conservative over
Labor majority. Then it
occurred to me that my
Labor friend whom I quoted
above had said that his
party would fight harder to
hold the marginal seats.
Then I corrected my article
to read 75. The final result
was 66.
But the results as they
came through showed how
shrewd the observations of
both Labor officials had
been. In the safe constituencies
the Labor loss of votes
ran in a great many cases
around 2000. But whenever
a marginal constituency was
reached in the counting the
Labor loss was much less.
Labor's high command,
therefore, was expecting a
defeat, but was determined
to make the majority as
small as possible.
The lesson the Republican
Party must learn in the
industrial States in the
North is that in order to win
in future elections it must
not only equal but greatly
exceed the efficiency in
organization of the Democrats.
For in those States the
Democrats can generally
count on the labor auxiliaries
of the CIO and the
AFL. They can command
mass support.
The Republicans must
make what, for want of a
better word, I call a personalized
campaign. For they
can appeal to no large,
manageable groups.
Unless the Republican
Party leaders can mobilize
the organization for such a
campaign, they can scarcely
regain control of the two
houses of Congress in 1956.
