CANADA'S
WAY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
OTTAWA—An acquaint-
ance over a period of 25
years with Paul Martin,
now the Canadian Minister
of Health and Welfare, has
keenly interested me in his
recent brilliant success in
providing the new polio
vaccine for the children of
his country. This achieve-
ment has been a sharp and
refreshing contrast with the
misfortunes of our own ad-
ministration in Washington.
In discussing the subject
here, Martin made it very
plain to me that he and his
government regret any in-
vidious comparisons with
the experience of the
United States. He is even
so modest as to say that
Canada has merely been
lucky.
His story of the Canadian
part in the development of
the vaccine goes back some
years. It seems that over
in Toronto in the Con-
naught Medical Research
Laboratories, a distin-
guished doctor was carry-
ing on some experiments
with cancer tissue.
*
He needed a medium of
culture for his work, and
two other doctors, J. F.
Morgan and R. C. Parker,
together with Miss Helen
Morton (now Mrs. Coval),
developed some for him.
The cancer specialist found
this unsuitable for his pur-
pose and the material was
put aside.
About three years ago,
while Dr. Salk and others
were working hopefully to-
ward the creation of a suc-
cessful vaccine, it became
evident that in the produc-
tion of the substance in
large quantities, a more
productive culture would
be needed.
The Morgan-Parker re-
search team conceived the
idea that the medium they
had developed for the can-
cer researcher might work
with polio virus.
Martin was told about it
and, as a result, steps were
taken to ascertain the suit-
ability of the medium for
the Salk vaccine, and this
was found to be highly suc-
cessful.
*
While the long and anx-
ious trials of the vaccine
were proceeding in the
United States, Martin's Min-
istry of Health was at work
preparing for the moment
when success was assured
and announced. And so on
the day when the famous
announcement was made in
Ann Arbor last April, the
Dominion government, in
co-operation with the health
authorities in the Provinces
and the Connaught Labora-
tories, were ready with the
supplies of the vaccine.
These supplies were in the
hands of the health author-
ities all over the nation.
Martin realized that safe-
ty was the first considera-
tion, and in the preparation
of the vaccine he had estab-
lished a double test—one at
Connaught and another at
the Ministry's own labora-
tory at Ottawa.
The Ministry has also pro-
vided for flying teams of
experts to check up on any
reports of unfavorable re-
sults.
*
In Martin's disclaimers of
any suggestion that the Ca-
nadian operation should be
compared with that in the
United States, he points out
the great differences in size
between the two countries.
The task was simpler here
because it was smaller.
Also, there were six man-
ufacturers licensed in the
United States, while in Can-
ada manufacturing was con-
centrated in the Connaught
Laboratories.
But there was something
more than luck in three of
the major factors in the Ca-
nadian success. One was the
centrally controlled, double-
inspection system; another
was the distribution of
quantities of the vaccine
long before the announce-
ment was made of the dis-
covery and finally there was
no hesitation in putting the
inoculation program into
high gear at once.
A personal element in
this story is not without
significance.
Martin himself suffered a
slight attack of the disease
as a child and his son also
contracted polio.
These reminders perhaps
stressed in his mind the
need for every precaution
first and, after that, decisive
action. But these are, after
all, the marks of a great ad-
ministrator.
