FOREIGN AID STUDY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The report of the Hoover
Commission on the over-
seas economic operations
of the United States offers
for the average American
the most succinct and un-
derstandable, but at the
same time the most com-
prehensive, picture of this
subject that has yet been
available.

Up to now most of us
have had to appraise this
vast activity with vague
feelings ranging from vio-
lent prejudice against doing
anything for foreign coun-
tries to a sentimental urge
that it is better to help
others than to help our-
selves. The Hoover Com-
mission makes it possible
for us to conceive a rational
point of view somewhere
between these extremes.

*

It suggests to us that
there are problems of hu-
manitarian and economic
advancement which the
United States can help
solve with advantage to it-
self. But it also makes very
clear that such aid must
become increasingly selec-
tive, since the world has
come a long way toward
recovery in the decade
since the end of the war.

This recovery having tak-
en place most rapidly in
Western Europe, it is time
to withdraw our help there
entirely.

In approaching this most
controversial subject, the
commission had the advan-
tage of having a chairman
who certainly, of all Amer-
icans, can least be charged
with provincial isolation-
ism. For Herbert Hoover
still stands, in the opinion
of the informed people of
the world, as the first Amer-
ican who undertook on a
big scale the task of bring-
ing American humanitar-
ian and economic aid to
foreign nations.

*

This advantage the for-
mer President needed in
seeking a meeting of minds
among the commissioners.
The result is almost com-
plete agreement among the
members of the commis-
sion.

Rep. Holifield, the Cali-
fornia Democrat, as in near-
ly every report, chose to
take the position that every-
one was out of step but
his distinguished self, and
James A. Farley offered a
mild dissent on a rec-
ommendation concerning
Western Europe.

Merely to say that the
United States has spent
50 billion dollars in foreign
aid since the end of the war
cannot convey the size and
complexity of the operation.
For the American public
has become so used to such
figures that they make lit-
tle impression. The cost of
the war itself has in a sense
destroyed our capacity to
comprehend the meaning of
a billion dollars.

*

Even such a simple thing
as a determination of how
much of the eight billion
dollars unexpended balance
from former years has been
committed is not available.
In short, we cannot know, so
far as I can see, whether or
how much of the new
$3,400,000,000 now asked by
the President is necessary.

The Hoover report shows
how the confusion can be
eliminated and hundreds of
millions can be saved. We
shall see whether Congress
heeds this advice.

But when we read in the
report of the infinite vari-
ety of our spending schemes
and the many departments
of government which are
still spending, and the vast
army of spenders whom we
are supporting at home and
abroad on this task, we be-
gin to realize what our
warm heart and our cold
feet have got us into. For
almost everything that a
virile bureaucracy could
conceive has been done
somewhere or other.

*

Meanwhile, Presidents
have organized and reor-
ganized these activities,
Congresses have passed a
multitude of laws and
amendments to laws, and
the executives in charge
have operated with an in-
finite variety of methods.

The result is a mass of ac-
tivities which, according to
the Hoover report, cannot
be suddenly stopped but
which, if some order is not
restored, will bring us noth-
ing but ridicule abroad and
bankruptcy at home.
