HIGH DAM
ISSUE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
On June 12 a big political
meeting was held in Port-
land, Or., seemingly de-
signed to welcome that no
longer lost sheep, Wayne
Morse, into the Democratic
fold.
Ex-President Truman
was there and according to
a newspaper report he and
the Senator "gave each oth-
er resounding back-pattings
during the program."
This is perfectly defensi-
ble politics. But in his
speech the ex-President
made a statement which is
reminiscent of some of his
more reckless utterances
when he was President:
"If you have a great plan
for an entire river basin,
like the plan for the Co-
lumbia, then the technique
is for the Federal govern-
ment to give up the crucial
dam sites, and get the Fed-
eral Power Commission to
turn them over to private
companies for piecemeal
exploitation. This will block
the future growth of the
whole system and prevent
existing dams from turning
out as much power as they
could."
*
The internal construction
of those two sentences
shows that, while they say
something which is in it-
self a reckless untruth, they
were not careless, off-the-
cuff utterances. They were
obviously aimed at the
Hell's Canyon issue, then
before the Federal Power
Commission.
Two months later the
FPC has handed down its
decision and in so doing has
clearly proved that the Tru-
man charge is untrue.
The "plan" to which Tru-
man refers is a famous blue-
print prepared over a pe-
riod of more than 20 years
by the Army Corps of En-
gineers. This is popularly
known in the Northwest as
308.
This plan is the basic
source of information on
the Columbia Basin. But,
like all plans, it is in a con-
stant process of revision.
â˜…
In the many months of
hearings for the Federal
Power Commission on the
Idaho Power Co.'s applica-
tion for a license to build
three dams on the Snake
River in Hell's Canyon, the
examiner was William J.
Costello who is, I believe, a
holdover from the Truman
administration.
Officers from the Corps
of Engineers testified at
length to the effect that a
number of other plans for
the Snake and Columbia
would be the equivalent or
better than the one to build
the "high" Federal dam at
Hell's Canyon.
G. H. Fernald of the
Corps of Engineers present-
ed an alternative plan. The
examiner concluded that
"construction of the pro-
posed Bruces Eddy and
Penny Cliffs project on the
Clearwater River, together
with Pleasant Valley and
Mountain Sheep projects on
the Snake River below the
Hell's Canyon site, would
provide more flood control
storage in the area than
was anticipated at the big
dam in the middle Snake."
*
That simply means that
so far as the development
and control of the river
flow is concerned, the pro-
posed Federal dam at Hell's
Canyon was only one of
many possibilities and that
many others will still be
available, despite the build-
ing of the Idaho Power
Co.'s three dams.
That covers storage and
flood control. With refer-
ence to power production,
the record also shows that
the Idaho Power Co.'s dams
will produce almost as
much as the Federal dam
would and also that there
are innumerable sites left
to be developed for power.
Certainly it is not against
the public interest for pri-
vate money to help in the
development of power for
the Northwest, since there
will be needed in the next 10
years an investment of
about 3 billion dollars.
If Truman thinks that any
such money will be appro-
priated by Congress, then
he profited little by his ex-
perience in Washington.
For even the Hell's Canyon
project, costing a tenth of
that sum, was rejected over
and over, despite all he
could do to put it through.
Apparently age cannot
wither Truman's infinite
variety of misrepresenta-
tions.
