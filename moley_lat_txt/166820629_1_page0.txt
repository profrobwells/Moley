CALGARY, Alberta—In
a previous article I de-
scribed the strange origins
and philosophy of the So-
cial Credit movement
which, under its noted
leader, the Rev. William
Aberhart, took over the
government of Alberta in
1935.
Like its predecessor, the
United Farmers of Alberta,
it was from the beginning a
class party. Aberhart found
it impossible to put his
theories into effect because
of constitutional objections.
Indeed, before he died in
1943 he must have realized
that the veto of his schemes
by the Supreme Court and
the national Parliament of
Canada was a stroke of good
fortune so far as the sur-
vival of his party was con-
cerned. For it left him noth-
ing as a guide to his gov-
ernment but the normal,
orthodox principles of any
government in a capitalistic
society.
His successor, Ernest C.
Manning, has attempted no
revival of the old Social
Credit ideas except an oc-
casional reference in his an-
nual budget speeches. His
obvious conservatism, to-
gether with the threat dur-
ing the war of a real Social-
ist movement under the Co-
operative Commonwealth
Federation, brought to his
aid many business interests
and wealthy farmers who
had opposed Aberhart.

Meanwhile, a great oil
boom struck Alberta in the
years immediately follow-
ing the war. This oil was
found largely under the
crown lands which had
been ceded to the Prov-
inces in 1930. The royalties
and the money derived
from leases to the oil com-
panies have been a rich
windfall to the Manning
government. In the last
eight years this revenue
has amounted to something
like $400.000,000. This has
made it unnecessary to levy
sales taxes and has made it
possible to reduce the pro-
vincial debt to a very small
remainder.
Nothing could be more
advantageous to a party in
power. Under these condi-
tions Social Credit captured
51 of the 61 seats in the
Provincial Legislature
in 1952. The largest group
in the opposition was made
up of four Liberals.

An editor in Saskatche-
wan made the comment to
me when I was in Regina
that there are always three
phases in the life of a party
in power — first there is
devotion, then arrogance,
and finally corruption.
Certainly the Manning
party attained the second
of these phases after the
1952 election. But the
leader of the Liberals, J.
Harper Prowse, decided that
the third phase had been
reached and began, with the
powerful aid of the conser-
vative Calgary Herald, to
prove his case. Improprie-
ties of many sorts were
charged against members of
the government and Social
Credit members of the
Legislature. Manning, in
sheer self-defense, was com-
pelled to call an election,
which was held in June.
I was interested to note
as I read the newspaper
accounts of the bitter cam-
paign that there was hard-
ly a mention of the ideas on
the basis of which the Social
Credit movement began.
Nor was there much to say
about efficiency in govern-
ment. The sole issue was
corruption and impropriety,
with Manning and his party
on the defensive.

The result was a reduc-
tion in the number of seats
held by Social Credit to 37,
with the Liberals holding
15. Three of Manning's
Ministers were defeated, and
he has decided not to
attempt to win new seats
for them in by-elections.
With Prowse as leader,
the 15 Liberals will be a
formidable opposition, and
if conditions charged in the
recent campaign are really
prevalent, it will not be
surprising to see another
election before many
months have passed.
This political battle over
corruption, however, will
not affect the booming
prosperity of the Province,
for the Liberals are just as
anxious to bring in new
business as is Social Credit.
Nor are the farmers
worried, because they
"never had it so good." Only
in some half-forgotten
pamphlets can references to
the easy-money theories of
Aberhart be found.
