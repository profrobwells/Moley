Farsighted members of
the British Labor Party
hoped that the conference
at Margate would provide
some sort of answer to the
basic reason why their
party has steadily, almost
disastrously, declined in
effectiveness and power in
the past three elections.
That reason is not to be
found in its lack of new and
fresh ideals, although that
lack exists. Nor is it in the
crumbling away of its
leadership in the face of
advancing age. It is basical-
ly because it has depended
so long on mere mass
solidarity among wage
workers, bound together by
the negative cement of
hatred of capitalism.

The fact is that capitalism
in Britain and elsewhere
has moved so effectively to
rid itself of the practices
that in former years
justified the attacks of its
enemies that British Social-
ists have been kicking a
dead horse ever since the
war.
A former Labor M.P.,
Anthony Crosland, recently
blurted out this bitter truth
in an article in The
Observer on "Labor's
Future."
"The first essential is a
complete mental and psy-
chological readjustment to
the fact that the long-run
problems of concern to So-
cialists are no longer eco-
nomic . . . Prewar capital-
ism has been transformed
almost out of recognition.
. . . The economic system
no longer poses these tra-
ditional problems."

From this point Cros-
land's discussion blurs off
into rather unintelligible
double talk. But the admis-
sion that Socialism no long-
er deals with economics is
like saying that, as a sci-
ence, hydraulics no longer
has to do with water.
Who, after all, taught us
or tried to teach us 40 years
ago that all political prob-
lems were essentially eco-
nomic? Who invented the
phrase "economic deter-
minism"?
Harold Wilson, another
Labor M.P., came up with
the same premise-namely,
that the Socialists had lost
their old bugaboos. But he
then proceeded to point to
the real flaw in the Labor
Party. It is bad organiza-
tion. For when a party can-
not be held together by
emotional solidarity, it
must have some other
means of cohesion.
Wilson, who seems to be
one of the few members of
the Labor Party with real
administrative capacity,
was appointed chairman of
a committee in June, 1955,
after the disastrous defeat
of the party, to study party
organization and to make
recommendations for its
improvement.
The Wilson report, which
was submitted to the Mar-
gate Conference, is an excel-
lent treatise on party or-
ganization in general and on
the present Labor Party in
particular. It made no at-
tempt to underestimate the
deplorable state of decay
into which the party has
fallen:
"The fact remains that
compared with our oppo-
nents we are still in a pen-
ny-farthing stage in a jet-
propelled era, and our ma-
chine, at that, is getting
rusty and deteriorating with
age."
*
The Wilson report, how-
ever, disclaimed any inten-
tion to suggest that Labor
copy the fine Conservative
organization created by
Maxwell-Fyfe and managed
so long by Viscount Wool-
ton. But, despite this dis-
claimer, it is clear that the
Wilson report in essence
followed Conservative lines
of administration.
However, the atmosphere
into which the Wilson re-
port was introduced was so
charged with the clashing
ambitions of leaders that
little attention was paid to
it.
There was the familiar at-
tack upon the Attlee poli-
cies by Aneurin Bevan, and
the latter's defeat in a con-
test for party office. More
important, there was a great
deal of inside political
sniping between the forces
of Herbert Morrison and
those of Hugh Gaitskell,
both of whom are candidates
for party leadership when
and if the old and ailing
Attlee decides to step aside.
Ultimately, however, the
Labor Party will have to
come to grips with the is-
sue of organization. For no
matter who may hold the ti-
tle of leader, there can be
no success at the polls with-
out a disciplined army of
workers.
