TOO EARLY
TO CHEER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

No commentator has a
right to analyze the exact
reasons for the actions of
the financial community,
but it is a fair assumption
that rising prices of stocks
are due much more to the
prospects of continued
spending by the Federal
government than to the asserted efforts of the Treas-
ury to balance the budget.
For the remarks of Secretary Humphrey merely
indicate that because of the
boom there will be larger
revenues.

Once more, Sen. Byrd is
right when he points out
the obvious fact that a balanced budget should be
attained by retrenchment
in spending. But with two
political parties scrambling
for votes, Byrd's advice
will, as usual, be rejected.

After Secretary Humphrey made his prediction
of larger revenues, two Senators, one Democratic and
the other Republican,
rushed into print with predictions of tax reductions.
There may indeed be tax
reductions in a year with
a Presidential election,
whether the budget is balanced or not, and the effect
would be still more inflation and more headaches
in years to come.

The Tax Foundation,
which has no political axes
to grind, presents some cold
figures which should be
pondered by every taxpayer.
It points out that a
mere recital of the appropriations made by Congress in its session this year
not only fails to tell the
whole story but is a frightfully deceptive way to take
the financial pulse of the
nation.

But even when we consider appropriations, the
session of 1955 was $4,257,000,000 more extravagant
than the session of 1954. In
other words, Congress
raised its appropriations for
fiscal 1956 by that amount
over its appropriations for
fiscal 1955.

Quite properly, the Treasury and the Budget Bureau,
in telling us what our government is costing us, speak
not only of appropriations
but of "new obligational authority," which includes not
only current appropriations
but also permanent appropriations that run automatically from year to year
and new contract and loan
authorizations.

The total obligational authority for 1956 is $60,300,000,000, which is $1,413,000,000
less than was asked by
President Eisenhower. But
this is by no means the
whole story.

"Consideration of all aspects of the budget situation," says the Tax Foundation, "leads to the disturbing
conclusion that supplemental appropriations in
next sessions and rising
costs of farm support,
which are outside the area
of appropriations, may more
than wipe out any savings
thus far effected in terms
of expenditures in fiscal
1956.

"Congress failed to make
provision for the increase
in salaries of postal and
classified Federal employees
which were assured by laws
enacted during the session.
Later supplementary
appropriations for salaries
and statutory commitments
may amount to $500,000,000
more. Moreover, many
of the claimed reductions in
appropriations will not be
reflected in an equal curtailment of expenditures in
1956. Two hundred and
ninety-six million dollars of
reductions in defense appropriations represents merely
a bookkeeping matter involving the use of foreign
currencies.

"About $350,000,000 of reductions in appropriations
for the Atomic Energy Commission were nullified (also
by bookkeeping transfers).
A reduction in the Mutual
Security program of $563,000,000 is made largely
meaningless in terms of fiscal 1956 by the availability
of a newly found prior balance of $302,000,000, by a
$100,000,000 cut in the President's Asiatic economic development fund not intended
to be used during the
first year."

In a number of other respects, the outlook represented in the Treasury's
statement should be modified. It is therefore too early
to cheer.
