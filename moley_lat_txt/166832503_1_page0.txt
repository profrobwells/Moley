SURRENDER REJECTED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

It was a source of great
disappointment to those
who were aware of the
perils to our economy in
certain proposed interna-
tional agreements that the
President and his Secretary
of State refused, two years
ago, to agree to any reason-
able modification of the
Bricker amendment.
But it is to the credit of
this administration that it
has stood firmly against a
number of proposed plans
which would have serious-
ly invaded the jursidiction
of Congress and the courts
of this country.

Lasting credit for this re-
sistance to the schemes of
Socialists abroad and at
home go to Herbert Hoover
Jr., Undersecretary of State;
Felix Wormser, Assistant
Secretary of the Interior,
and Preston Hotchkis, who
served for a time as Ameri-
can member on the U.N.
Economic and Social Coun-
cil.
Sen. Thomas E. Martin
of Iowa presented a most
informative review of
events in this field at a
meeting of the American
Mining Congress at Las
Vegas last week.
The so-called Havana
Charter, which would have
been a wholesale surrender
of American sovereignty,
was submitted by President
Truman to Congress and
decisively rejected. After
that experience, the zealous
people, mostly Americans,
who had originally spon-
sored the Havana Charter,
have attempted to slip their
handiwork through piece-
*
meal.
So the U.N. Economic and
Social Council brought
about an international, "co-
ordinating" committee,
which brought forth a com-
modity agreement which
representatives of the State
Department attempted to
have this government ac-
cept. This effort was stopped
in its tracks by Wormser,
representing the Depart-
ment of the Interior, and by
representatives of the De-
partment of Commerce.
Another chapter of the
Havana Charter dealt with
international agreements to
prevent restrictive business
practices-in short, an in-
ternational antitrust law.
This has been firmly reject-
ed by the United States. But
its rejection has not cooled
the ardor of the proponents.
One of them, Sigmund
Timberg, appeared only last
month before the Senate
Subcommittee on Antitrust
and Monopoly. Timberg had
served as secretary of the
"ad hoc" committee of the
U.N. and before that was for
many years an official of the
U. S. Department of Justice.
The proposed agreement
still pressed upon Congress
by Timberg would set up
an international tribunal to
determine what practices
are restrictive. The nations
accepting the agreement
would then prosecute the
accused in their own courts.
Thus our agencies of jus-
tice would have their work
cut out for them by an in-
ternational body. But this
agreement would not be op-
erative in nations with no
antitrust laws. It would ap-
ply only to the United
States, Canada, and possibly
to the United Kingdom.

*

The implication of this is
that the United States was
asked to accept an interna-
tional body to bring indict-
ments against its own citi-
zens, created by a lot of na-
tions which were them-
selves immune. This, of
course, would be a complete
surrender of sovereignty in
a matter vitally affecting
the entire American econo-
my.
The rejection of this pro-
posal by this administration
is no reason to expect that
attempts of a similar na-
ture would not be accepted
by future administrations
more friendly to interna-
tional Socialism.
In fact, the creation of
the Havana Charter and its
submission to Congress by
President Truman clearly
mean that should the Tru-
man-Acheson policies again
become the policies of this
government, our economy
would soon find itself under
the control of international
tribunals.
That is why the Bricker
amendment or a reasonable
amendment thereof should
be adopted without further
delay.
