DISPERSAL UP THE COLORADO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In last week's issue of
Newsweek there appeared
an interview with Sen. Wat-
kins, urging once more his
scheme for Federal develop-
ment of the Upper Colora-
do region.
In addition to the old ar-
guments for that multibil-
lion-dollar project for pow-
er and irrigation, he pre-
sents a new one. This
should arrest the attention
of every taxpayer in an in-
dustrial State which would
have to pay for the Wat-
kins plan.

He answers a question
whether the Upper Colora-
do Project would aid na-
tional defense by quoting a
fantastic statement of Val.
Peterson, who is supposed
to be in charge of civil de-
fense. The statement ap-
pears: "The potentially fatal
vulnerabliity of concentra-
tions of industry and peo-
ple is increasing year by
year . . . The Upper Colora-
do development, by provid-
ing water and power, would
pave the way for taking
care of those who by neces-
sity may be forced to evac-
uate our West Coast cities."
Let us see this argument
which Sen. Watkins so
quickly seizes to justify a
vast plan which, so far, Con-
gress has refused to pass. It
means that the taxpayers
of industrial States-all in-
dustrial States, for decen-
tralization would not be ap-
plied to the West Coast
aloneâ€”would first pay bil-
lions to build this great wa-
ter, power and irrigation
scheme and then, when all
was ready, their industries
which produced the dollars
to pay their taxes would be
taken away from them.
If in the next session of
Congress the members of
the House of Representa-
tives from those industrial
States vote for this plan
their generosity will indeed
pass all understanding.
But is this, migration of
leisurely building of an
arsenal of democracy as in
1940-43. We should have to
fight with what we have.
The war would be fought
on inventory, not produc-
tive machinery.
Now let us consider what
Watkins and Peterson are
proposing. In the first place,
it has been admitted over
and over that the Upper
Colorado project could not
be built except over a
period of years. But while
this haven in the desert and
canyons is being prepared,
months and years will be re-
quired to move the in-
dustries from where they
are.
*
They would therefore,
in part at least, be out of
commission just when they
are needed the most, which
is in the immediate future.
But suppose we wait, and
in 1970 or so all the great
industries are huddled
along the Colorado River in
Colorado and Utah and
along the branches and sub-
branches in Wyoming and
New Mexico.
Then suppose war comes.
The Russians or Chinese or
whatnot might drop a few
bombs on the great dams on
which this industry is
based. It would be just as
easy to hit an Echo Park
Dam as a factory in Los An-
geles or Seattle.
Salt Lake City is just as
accessible as Detroit or
San Francisco in these days
of supersonic speed and
stratospheric altitudes.
What then, Sen. Watkins?
