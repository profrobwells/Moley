LABOR 'UNITY' IN OHIO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While labor's big chiefs
powwowed in New York
last week, putting the final
touches on the AFL-CIO
merger, some of their
braves were already on the
warpath in Ohio.
While George Meany,
president of the AFL, was
announcing that the forma-
tion of a single 14,500,000-
member national labor or-
ganization was "practically
completed," and Walter
Reuther flashed a dazzling
grin for press photogra-
phers, Reuther's United
Auto Workers were en-
gaged in a desperate fight
with something less than
the enthusiastic support of
Ohio's AFL.

As was pointed out in
this column recently, the
UAW-CIO in Ohio is out to
make legal the supplemen-
tal unemployment compen-
sation which its members
could receive under con-
tracts with Ford and Gen-
eral Motors, and to boost
State unemployment bene-
fits far above those of any
other State in the Union ex-
cept Nevada.
Reuther's misleading
boasts notwithstanding, un-
less Ohio can be brought in-
to line, the much-touted,
so-called guaranteed an-
nual wage contracts may
well die of natural causes
in 1957.
AFL support of CIO aspi-
rations has been only luke-
warm in Ohio. For what the
UAW-CIO has done is a
radical departure from the
long-accepted practices of
collective bargaining and
appeal to State Legislatures.
It has, in the words of an
experienced AFL leader,
"gone over the head of the
State Legislature." It has
managed this by using the
initiative and referendum
procedure.
*
Since the Legislature
turned down its bill at its
last session, it has placed
the issue on the November
ballot. The UAW-CIO has
done this largely to gain for
itself special advantages
which AFL members would
not receive, since AFL
members have no such con-
tracts as those now existing
with Ford and GM. Al-
though some money has
drifted into the campaign
coffers from AFL unions, it
is apparently a gesture to
indicate outward harmony.
This situation in Ohio
may presage troubles which
can be the offspring of the
elaborate joining of two
huge and basically different
labor organizations. Funda-
mentally, the CIO is a "ver-
tical" organization. It has
developed along the indus-
trial pattern.
*
Membership in a CIO un-
ion ranges from, say, the
highly trained assembly-
line mechanics down to the
fellows who sweep the
floors in Ford's Cleveland
foundry. The AFL has al-
ways placed the emphasis
on horizontal structure,
with its unions grouping
themselves by specific
trades, crafts or skills.
Many union members, in
AFL and CIO alike, with
skilled jobs and seniority,
see the abuses to which ex-
cessively high benefits will
give rise, and do not relish
the prospects of seeing oth-
ers receiving in tax-free un-
employment compensation
almost as much as they
earn by the sweat of their
brows.
This is particularly true
of those who are beginning
to realize that high unem-
ployment benefits mean
high payroll taxes and that
the workingman as well as
business in Ohio will suffer
over the long run.
*
Articulate labor people
recognize a Socialistic
trend in the labor move-
ment inherent in this UAW
program. And then there
are AFL men who simply
don't like the CIO; never
have and never will.
Although it may appear
that Reuther has taken a
back seat to George Meany
in the forthcoming organi-
zation, his sights are set on
the political potential that
organization will possess.
Even within that organiza-
tion his struggle for politi-
cal power will be difficult.
Seeds of incompatability, if
not bad blood, are already
there. If Reuther's UAW
takes a beating in Ohio, his
future may be cloudy.
