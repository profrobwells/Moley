Last week the official
Democratic Party organi-
zation was running against
Herbert Hoover. Last year
the opponent was McCarthy.
This week, the official word
is that Nixon is the target.
Paul Butler, Democratic
national chairman, in a
series of press conferences
in California singles out the
California Vice-President as
the real peril next year if
Eisenhower runs and Nixon
runs with him.
The gruesome suggestion
is that, since Eisenhower
will be past 65, Nixon is
likely to be President by suc-
cession. This is a convenient
but somewhat indirect way
of disposing of an opposing
candidate.
Just say it is unnecessary
to discuss him because he
will be dead anyhow. De
mortuis nil nisi bonum.
Among the many things
that disqualify Nixon, ac-
cording to Butler, is the fact
that he hits hard in a cam-
paign. He is "always en-
gaged in the smear-type of
campaign and questioning
the honesty of those who
didn't agree with him."
*
This attack is significant,
not because Butler and his
party really mean to reveal
their strategy now but be-
cause it is intended to have
a certain effect upon the ad-
visers who shape the Presi-
dent's thinking in politics.
Democrats know quite
well that it might be pos-
sible to throw sufficient fear
into the people around the
President to make them feel
that Nixon is a dangerous
liability.
Some of those people
would prefer a Vice-Presi-
dential candidate from the
eastern or internationalist
wing of the party. They
might settle for Gov. Herter
of Massachusetts or the
every-ready Harold Stassen.
They also feel that the
Communist issue is not se-
rious, that Nixon made too
much of it in the 1954 cam-
paign, and that it is wrong
to accuse the Truman ad-
ministration of corruption.
Those advisers are aug-
mented by a considerable
number of commentators
who have been attacking
Nixon for a long time be-
cause he did raise the is-
sues of Communism and
corruption. Those commen-
tators support Eisenhower
only on the theory that he
is not a real Republican and
that all Republicans west of
Scranton should be purged.
Both of these groups-
the left-wing, internation-
alist advisers of the Presi-
dent, and the anti-Republi-
can commentators — know
the President, because of
his inexperience in politics,
can be greatly influenced
by what the opposition is
saying.
They hope that the mind
of the President can be
bent to the belief that Nixon
is a serious liability and
that he can be persuaded to
drop Nixon, just as Roose-
velt was persuaded to drop
Wallace in 1944.
The anti-Republican com-
mentators and the experi-
enced Democrats know and
the Eisenhower advisers fail
to realize that this line of
action, if it succeeds in turn-
ing the President against
the Vice-President, will pre-
cipitate a violent internal
war in the Republican Par-
ty.
California Republi-
cans would resent any such
move so bitterly that it
would be difficult if not im-
possible for the President
to carry it next year. For
Californians are very proud
indeed of their representa-
tion in Washington, and in
the most populous part of
the State Nixon is a home-
town boy.

Nixon fully appreciates
this opposition and the mo-
tives behind it. He also
realizes what the President
should realize — that the
softness toward Eisenhow-
er by the Democrats is not
stimulated by any love of
the man.
They are trying to get
him out of office, to dis-
credit him, and only ex-
pediency prompts them to
speak softly now. Nixon
believes in party govern-
ment. He believes in car-
rying the political war to
the opposition. He hates
Communism and was, as a
member of the House, the
man who broke the Hiss
case and awakened a leth-
argic country to the danger
of Communists in govern-
ment.
Nixon has grown in his
present office. That is why
he has created such opposi-
tion.
