In Hawthorne's immortal
tale, "Feathertop," an old
hag fashioned a creature
out of a broomstick and
other odds and ends, gave it
some platitudes and a few
social commonplaces to say,
and turned it loose on the
community. Only a child
and a dog penetrated the
insubstantial nature of the
effigy.
I suspect that the dogs of
Britain, like those of other
lands, are individualists by
nature. At any rate, they
have never depended upon
mass solidarity. But the
youth of that nation for a
time believed that Social-
ism as preached by Shaw,
MacDonald and others was
the answer to the ills of
mankind.
After a cruel war which
was made inevitable by the
blundering of those entrust-
ed with the foreign affairs
of the United Kingdom and
by years of depression for
which the financial and in-
dustrial leaders of the coun-
try found no remedy, Brit-
ish youth decided to give
the surgeries and elixirs
proffered by the Labor Par-
ty a trial.
Years followed in which
the Socialist feathertops
were permitted to strut the
stage, to utter their plati-
tudes and to fumble with
the reins of power.
Six of those years proved
a number of things to the
fresh minds of youth. They
learned that national plan-
ning was in reality planning
by a group of politicians
who had never been very
successful in planning their
own lives, that wealth for
all cannot be got by slicing
existing wealth in thinner
portions, that behind the
Socialistic platitudes which
promise concern for the fine
amenities of life there is
tyranny of regimentation,
and that when industries
are seized by the govern-
ment they are of no more
value to the collective own-
ers than they were when
title in them rested with
grasping capitalists.
Youth found, moreover,
that the Labor Party was in
its leadership old and shop-
worn. "Good Old Clem" was
no herald of a new day but
a homespun character out
of Dickens.
In the universities the
Socialist faculty members,
who had been nurtured in
the earlier years when Shaw
and Wells were in style,
grew old and lost their at-
traction for students. The
inevitable rebellion of youth
against its elders took place.
Able students turned con-
servative in their search
for something better than
the homilies taught by So-
cialistic hacks and thinly
veneered Communists.
And now, as the battered
Labor Party holds its an-
nual conference at Margate,
two admissions feature the
opening session.
*
The first is a tomplaint
that the leadership of the
party has neglected the
youth. of the country. Re-
porters who are there, and
who also attended the Con-
servative conference last
week note the predomi-
nance of age at Margate
and the prominence of
youth among the Tories.
There is, moreover, little
to be said about further na-
tionalization of industry.
This closely follows the line
taken by Labor orators in
the campaign last May.
Even then, nationalization
was a tonic to be shunned.
Among leaders of the La-
bor Party there is a lot of
talk about modernizing So-
cialism. This is a bit naive.
For Socialism is the ascend-
ency of government in eco-
nomic affairs, and that is
not modern at all and never
has been.

There is much to be
learned from this situation
by both Democrats and Re-
publicans in the United
States. The former seem
to be completely unaware
of the fact that the Kefau-
vers and Morses and others
who believe that people can
be aroused by advocating
public ownership of utili-
ties are speaking of-lan-
guage that was current 50
years ago. And Repub-
licans who believe that the
way to Republican success
is by emulating the old and
discredited Fair Deal are
not ahead, as they think,
but behind the times. Here,
as in Britain, collectivism
is a twice-told tale.
