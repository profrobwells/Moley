RAYMOND MOLEY:
Sen. Knowland's Role
as Majority Leader
It's a long way from the
Golden Gate to London, but
a visitor in either region is
likely to encounter a good
many questions about Wil-
liam Knowland, senior Sen-
ator from California and
leader of the Senate Repub-
licans.
In England last spring I
heard and read a good many
animadversions about
Knowland's attitude toward
the Chinese Communists
and our obligations toward
the Nationalist government
on Formosa.
This I could dismiss as
the sentiment of a country
eager for a full resumption
of trade with China under
any conditions however
humiliating. Moreover, the
British, while generally
friendly to the United
States, always have a fa-
vorite American whipping
boy.
*
This year they have both
Knowland and Nixon in that
role; last year it was Mc-
Carthy; and for years be-
fore, it was Sen. Taft and
ex-President Hoover.
In California, which has
always seen China and Ja-
pan from an angle quite un-
like that visible to the Brit-
ish, the prestige of Know-
land is very high.
In 1952 his majority over
his opponent in the primary
which decided the election
was, as I remember, some-
thing like 1,600,000. That is,
as far as I have been able to
learn, the largest vote of
confidence ever given in
the United States for a can-
didate for any office, except-
ing the Presidency and Vice-
Presidency.

Californians are proud
of their representation in
Washington, which includes
the Vice-President; the
Chief Justice; Knowland;
Kuchel, the junior Senator,
and an able and aggressive
group of Congressmen. It
is seldom that a single State,
except occasionally New
York, has been so fortunate.
Criticism of a man as
prominent as Knowland is
inevitable, and there is
some in California.
Two complaints are that
he has been something less
than assiduous in his atten-
tions to his vast constitu-
ency, and that as leader of
his party in the Senate he
should follow the lead of
the President in all things.
An answer to the first of
these complaints can be
found in the Congressional
Record, and to the second
in the Constitution of the
United States.
A party leader in the Sen-
ate has an exacting, ali-ab-
sorbing job. He must be
there almost continuously,
and there are few discus-
sions on the floor in which
he is not involved. He must
maintain unity within his
party membership, watch
the opposition continuous-
ly, determine to a degree
the order of business, and
keep informed on a thou-
sand different subjects in-
volved in legislation.
The burden on a Senate
leader is graphically reflect-
ed in the tragic illness of
the Democratic leader, Sen.
Johnson of Texas.
Those whose memory
runs back 18 years can re-
call a heart attack by a Sen-
ate leader, Joseph Robin-
son, which had an even
more tragic end.
No doubt Knowland
would spurn any claim for
sympathy because of the
burden he must bear as
Taft's successor. But it
might serve his critics well
if they would realize the
facts.
*
They might also ponder
the classic reply of Edmund
Burke to his constituents
in Bristol in which he re-
minded them, "I could not
court you and serve you,
too."
The argument that the
Senate leader represents
the President is wholly
wrong. Perhaps this idea
grew up during the days
when F. D. R. sought to run
both the executive and the
legislative departments of
government.
Knowland is at once the
floor manager for his Re-
publican Senate colleagues
and an independent Sena-
tor. He is not responsible
to the President. He is in a
co-ordinate but separate de-
partment of government.
Knowland to those who
know him well is a man of
character, convictions and
courage. He can well sur-
vive the attacks of his crit-
ics at home and abroad,
