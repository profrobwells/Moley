A RISING
TIDE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The word "conservative"
is becoming respectable
again, just as the good old
word "liberal" has lost all
meaning since its theft by
the left wing.
Perhaps people are more
willing to call themselves
conservative because they
have witnessed the great
comeback of the Conserva-
tive Party in Britain. Per-
haps also they are turning
to some of the tried values
of the past because they are
disillusioned by the experi-
ence of this country with
20 years of radical experi-
mentation.
Like most changes in
trends of thinking, this re-
vival is most marked among
the young men and women
of the country. Last week I
was told in the course of a
visit to Princeton that it is
estimated that while 80% of
the faculty is "liberal,"
most of the students show
definite conservative tend-
encies. Harvard and several
other collegiate institutions
have conservative clubs.
*
Young men near the cen-
ter of the administration in
Washington are using the
word "conservative" to de-
scribe the policies which
they believe the President
has instituted in govern-
ment. In two excellent
speeches about the economic
policies of the Eisenhower
regime by Vice-President
Nixon and Gabriel Hauge,
the President's economic ad-
viser, the word "conserva-
tive" was used without
apology.
There has now appeared
a new weekly journal of
opinion, National Review,
which is dedicated to con-
servative policies. This
newcomer is the child of
William F. Buckley Jr.,
who four years ago violent-
ly upset his traditionally
self-assured alma mater
with his book, "God and
Man at Yale." His conten-
tion was that the faculty
was not only offering left-
wing economic views, but
was pretty freethinking in
dealing with religion.
*
In the babel of tongues
that ensued everybody lost
his sense of dignity except
the youthful Buckley. In
fact, his decorum was a re-
freshing contrast to the vio-
lent conduct of some of the
elders in New Haven.
Buckley has unques-
tioned courage. His de-
fiance of the Yale Dons
proved that. The effort to
start a new magazine
proves it once more. Per-
haps only his youth blinds
him to the fact that ardu-
ous and bitter years are
ahead. I speak with some
authority, for I was one of
a group which saw red for
years before Newsweek
turned the corner. But
youth will be served 'and,
apparently, will be well
served, if the first number
of National Review is any
evidence of things to come.
The Buckley magazine is
attractively printed, well
planned so far as depart-
mentalization is concerned
and is staffed with a num-
ber of excellent and expe-
rienced writers whose
soundness of thinking can-
not be questioned. It is
worth watching and read-
ing.
â˜…
The readers of National
Review must be patient,
however, because it takes a
while to develop an edito-
rial mechanism which can
put a fine cutting edge on
its literary output. It is not
easy to write opinion that
people will read with ease
and some of the pieces in
National Review will prove
that fact to the reader.
But the idea behind this
publishing venture is right;
those in charge have sin-
cerity and character and,
above all, they truly repre-
sent a young generation
which is looking for some-
thing better than synthetic
Socialism, which has been
the vogue these many years.
