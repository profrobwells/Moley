BRITISH LABOR'S DEFEAT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The British Labor Party,
after two bad beatings at
the polls, is badly disorgan-
ized. This is due not only to
the differences in policy
among the leaders but to a
general degeneration of
party machinery.
In the course of the
election last May, I found a
marked superiority in the
organization of the Con-
servatives at the level of
the constituencies. The La-
bor Party had paid agents
(managers) in only half of
the constituencies, while
the Conservatives were
efficiently organized almost
everywhere.
The Labor Party agents
were not of high caliber
and they were not ade-
quately paid. Their salaries
generally were about nine
pounds a week, which is
less than the pay of a mod-
erately skilled artisan in in-
dustry.
A good deal of the time
of the agents was taken be-
tween elections in trying to
raise enough money to pay
the rent of their meager
headquarters and to meet
their own salary require-
ments.
This was so general
wherever I went that I
asked one of the top organ-
izers of the Labor Party
how on earth they could
muster as many votes as
they did in 1951 and as they
were likely to get in 1955.
He acknowledged that
their organization was in-
ferior but said that they
had the advantage of mass
voting. In short, that their
people voted as workers
against the hated rich and
employers. But this soli-
darity, important as it was,
proved to be inadequate.
Consequently, there is now
a strong demand for a ma-
jor operation on the party
machine.
This subject will be fore-
most at the great annual
conference of the party
which opens at Margate
next week. Both parties
hold annual conferences,
but the Labor Party affair
is more important because
the resolutions and deci-
sions passed are binding on
the entire party, including
the representatives who sit
in the House of Commons.
In the Conservative Par-
ty the annual conference's
resolutions are not binding
on the Parliamentary group
of which the leader (now
Prime Minister) is the head
and boss.
Responsibility for Labor
reorganization this year will
largely rest with Hugh
Gaitskell, who is the party
treasurer and probably the
heir to the leadership when
Attlee retires. The party
needs money for such a re-
organization.
There will have to be
more agents at better pay,
and a better working staff
at the national headquar-
ters at Transport House.
This new money will in
large part have to come
from the trade unions. But
despite higher wages, full
employment and increased
prosperity the average un-
ion worker in Britain is
very niggardly in contribut-
ing to the party.
Such war chests as Reu-
ther and other labor bosses
are able to raise over here
for political campaigns
would be unheard of there.
Generally it comes down to
a shilling or two a year.
Trade union members are
free to refuse to contribute
anything, although the law
provides that they must
"contract themselves out"
in writing. Union members
almost unanimously vote
for Labor Party candidates,
but organization is needed
to gather in those marginal
voters who spell the differ-
ence between victory and
defeat.
In the event that the
party conference decrees a
thorough reorganization,
there will still be years of
work ahead before the La-
bor Party can hope to win a
Parliamentary election. The
Conservatives learned that
during their six long years
in the minority from 1945
to 1951.
