MOLEY AND LIPPMANN
On Federal Aid
to Public Schools
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the course of the next
few weeks there will be a
great deal of talk and of
writing about Federal aid
for schools. In the course of
that discussion it will, as
always, be said that it is
possible to have a system of
general Federal subsidies
without any Federal con-
trol.
It might be well, how-
ever, for those citizens who
for official reasons or as
mere parents may be in-
terested to consider care-
fully whether this is a pos-
sible or reasonable assump-
tion.
Some years ago, when
the Senate was considering
a bill for Federal school aid
in an amount of $300,000,
000 of which one of the
sponsors was the late Sen.
Taft, the question of con-
trol was raised on the
floor. Taft replied that if
language could prevent con-
trol to follow a grant, his
bill contained that lan-
guage. In the great honesty
that characterized him Taft
added that language alone
cannot guarantee the free-
dom of a subsidized school.
*
On this.subject a former
U.S. Commissioner of Edu-
cation, Dr. John J. Tigert,
said this:
"My experience in han-
dling Federal subsidies for
education under the limited
acts which are now in ex-
istence has taught me that
you must either have Fed-
eral control and interfer-
ence or you must have mis-
appropriation of funds and
waste . . . Reason and ex-
perience both indicate that
Federal money cannot be
expended wisely and ef-
ficiently except by exercis-
ing Federal control and su-
pervision, even then there
is considerable waste . . .
If we embark upon a pro-
gram of turning over Fed-
eral money to schools with-
out any strings attached, it
is only a question of time
until the waste, extrava-
gance and misuse of these
funds will result in a reac-
tion or a change. The alter-
native is Federal control."
*
The education committee
of the Commission on In-
tergovernmental Relations,
which was headed by Adam
S. Bennion and for which
the extraordinarily well-
informed Roger A. Freeman
served as research adviser,
said in 1954:
"If States cannot find
ways to allocate the almost
3 billion dollars in State
aid in such a way as to as-
sure adequate educational
opportunity, what reason do
we have to assume that they
would accomplish the objec-
tive with a few hundred mil-
lion dollars in Federal
funds? Federal action could
bring about universal edu-
cational opportunity only if
grants-in-aid were condi-
tioned upon control of dis-
tribution of both State and
Federal funds."
*
The plain fact is that if
the Federal government ap-
propriates money for any
purpose, it should assume
the responsibility for the
way it is spent. This means
control.
Perhaps, as some will ar-
gue, the control can be lim-
ited only to the purpose for
which the grant is made.
That is, if the grant is for
school building, there will
be control only over the ex-
penditure of money for
brick and mortar. And the
nature of the facts and ideas
which are taught will not
be affected.
This may be possible, but
before Congress embarks
on the sort of program that
is likely to emerge from the
White House conference, it
ought to be certain beyond
any reasonable doubt.
BY WALTER LIPPMANN
In a preceding article I
argued that the White
House conference on educa-
tion, which meets this week,
should make definite recom-
mendations on whether
and on how Federal aid
should be given to educa-
tion.
The problem is set forth
clearly in a pamphlet called
"Teachers for Tomorrow,"
which is published by the
fund for the advancement
of education, a creation of
the Ford Foundation. (I
should say for the sake of
the record that while I had
nothing to do with the prep-
aration of the pamphlet,
I am a member of the board
of the fund which is re-
sponsible for the pamphlet.)

Few of us, myself in-
cluded, have realized until
recently how enormously
and how suddenly the
American birth rate is in-
creasing. During the 40s
the enrollments year by
year in elementary schools
remained steady at about
20,000,000 children. This
year the enrollment has
jumped up to 29,000,000.
But when the babies born
in the last five record-
breaking years are ready
for school, enrollment will
be pushing 35,000,000.
This means that for every
100 enrolled in elementary
schools during the 40s there
will be 170 at the beginning
of the 60s. The big increase
in the secondary schools
will come a little later, as
the children grow older. By
the end of the 60s, which is
only four Presidential terms
away, the children who
have already been born will
be enough to push second-
ary school enrollment up
by more than 70% of what
it is today.
*
We come now to what we
may call the impossible
arithmetic of the teacher
problem. Our present ratio
of teachers to pupils is sup-
posed to be one teacher for
every 30 elementary pu-
pils, one teacher for every
25 secondary pupils, and
one teacher for every 13
college pupils. To have
enough teachers—if the
present teaching system is
to be maintained—it would
be necessary to recruit by
1965 an additional 500,000
elementary and secondary
school teachers. For the
colleges we shall by present
standards need in the next
15 years about double the
number of existing teach-
ers.
We cannot hope to find
that number of teachers.
We cannot hope to do so
even when—as we must—
we have raised teachers’
salaries. The number of
teachers needed will be one-
half of all college graduates
of every variety.
"It will be impossible,"
says the Ford pamphlet,
"under the present pattern
of teacher recruitment and
teacher utilization to secure
anywhere near enough good
teachers for our schools and
colleges over the next 15
years."
It will be necessary,
therefore, to find ways of
enabling teachers to teach
a larger number of pupils.
The arithmetic of the situa-
tion allows no escape from
this conclusion.
That being the case, the
obvious remedy is to supply
the qualified teachers with
aides who can take over the
housekeeping and clerical
chores, leaving the teachers
more time to teach. We
shall have to apply to the
teaching profession the
general principle which
Dael Wolfle, director of the
Commission on Human Re-
sources and Advanced
Training, states as follows:
"A trained expert seldom
works alone. A lawyer has
his clerks, an engineer his
draftsmen, a doctor his
nurses and technicians, a
research scholar his assist-
ants. How much the expert
accomplishes is partly de-
termined by his own ability,
but partly by the number
and skill of his assistants
and by the effectiveness
with which he uses them."
Experiments along these
lines are being conducted
in a number of school
systems and colleges. The
results have been encourag-
ing. But we are only at the
beginning of what is bound
to mean great changes in
the system and practice of
teaching.
In this field the White
House conference is not
called upon—as it is on the
question of Federal aid—
to make recommendations
to the government. Here the
problem belongs to the
schools and colleges in the
States, and any recom-
mendations that come from
the conference will be ad-
dressed to them. For the
Federal government as such
is not involved.
