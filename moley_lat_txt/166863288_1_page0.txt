Gov. Averell Harriman is
an authentic Tammany can-
didate for the Presidency.
He is the first New Yorker
to enjoy that doubtful rela-
tionship since the active
days of Alfred E. Smith
three decades ago.
But there is a vast dif-
ference. Smith's great ca-
pacity and his hold on the
people of the city and State
practically forced Tammany
to support him. Harriman
had no such assets when,
almost singlehanded, Caf-
mine de Sapio won him
the gubernatorial nomina-
tion over Franklin D. Roose-
velt Jr. in 1954.
Harriman's dependence
upon De Sapio's political
management is very great.
Al Smith's relations with
the renowned Charles F.
Murphy was that of an
equal. Finally, Murphy was
a towering figure in New
York politics. De Sapio, de-
spite the flurry of interest
in him these days, is just
another average Tammany
boss.
It is presumptuous, not
to say daring, for Harriman
to seek the nomination on
the basis of such precari-
ous antecedents. But, to
make the situation still
more grotesque, Robert
Wagner Jr., Mayor of New
York, also dependent upon
the political machine of De
Sapio's Tammany, has been
making motions as if he
wanted to become a Vice-
Presidential candidate with
Stevenson.
Consider the embarrass-
ment of these statesmen
when, during the past few
weeks, the New York news-
papers unearthed sensation-
al material which shows
that Tammany after all is
just the same old outfit
that has made its name
odious over the nation for
more than a century.
The present outbreak of
jobbery and incompetence
concerns the New York City
Commissioner of Correc-
tion, Anna M. Kross, who
has been a loyal Tammany-
ite for almost 40 years and
a city job holder for most
of that time.
She was a city magistrate
for 20 years until, with the
accession of Mayor Wagner,
she was appointed Commis-
sioner of Correction. Ap-
parently her concern has
been with jobs for various
relatives in her department
and elsewhere in the city
government. And while she
has been delivering high-
sounding disquisitions with
all of the familiar patter of
social reform, things have
been happening in the insti-
tutions under her control.
One situation concerns
the use made of a commis-
sary fund to pay the sala-
ries of political payrollers.
Another is the smuggling
of dope and the sale of fa-
vors in the city's prisons.
Investigations are under
way by Dist. Atty. Hogan,
a former protege of Thomas
E. Dewey; by the county
grand jury and by the City
Commissioner of Investiga-
tions.
Tilden, Cleveland, T. R.
Hughes, Dewey, and even
F. D. R. are examples of men
who have risen in the esti-
mation of the nation be-
cause they defied and
fought Tammany. No one
has yet won such esteem
because he was its friend.
Al Smith found Tammany
a heavy cross to bear in
his national campaigns.
Harriman will find De Sa-
pio and all the payroll
Krosses an equally heavy
burden.
