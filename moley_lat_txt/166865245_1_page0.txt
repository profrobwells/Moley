Farmers who voted Re-
publican in 1952 are un-
happy but are by no means
sure to vote Democratic
next year.
But a very considerable
number are "on the fence,"
hoping that the Eisenhower
administration will bring
aid before the next election.
These fence sitters are also
waiting until they see who
the candidates will be. They
are not especially interested
in the Democratic proposal
to scrap the flexible price
support program.
There are no real radical
movements being hatched
in the agricultural Midwest
such as characterized peri-
ods of farm depression in
the past.
Farmers are very sore at
labor bosses for their efforts
in raising wages and thus
the cost of the manufac-
tured articles they must
buy.
And, capriciously and
illogically, they do not think
that Secretary Benson has
done a good job for the
farmers, but at the same
time they approve of what
President Eisenhower has
done for the farmers.
These are significant con-
clusions that can be de-
duced from a careful survey
of four precincts in Nebras-
ka selected because they
represent various aspects
of the farm industry in that
State. The survey was con-
ducted by the Lincoln
Evening Journal and Ne-
braska State Journal. Ray-
mond McConnell Jr. makes
the following editorial com-
ment concerning the survey
conducted by the newspa-
per which he represents:
"Speaking as an advo-
cate of Republican dynamic
conservatism, this newspa-
per is pleased that the Ne-
braska farmers interviewed
are taking a reasonable at-
titude about their present
economic troubles; that
they have not launched any
radical, politically inspired
moves to exaggerate these
troubles and that they are
willing to allow the Eisen-
hower administration suf-
ficient time to formulate a
program to alleviate the
current price-cost squeeze
in which farmers find them-
selves.
"For the administration
the political message of the
survey is clear: It is not too
late to do something about
the cost-price squeeze, but
something must be done."
If the farmers of this
country are wise they will,
despite their present dis-
content, weigh three consid-
erations before they cast
their votes.
First, they will recall
that when the Democrats
who are now trying to win
their votes were in full pos-
session of the government
there were serious ailments
on the farms. In fact, the
present slide began well be-
fore Secretary Benson was
appointed.
Second, the Democratic
candidate who will seek
their votes next year will
be under heavy obligations
to the labor bosses. Indeed,
he may well be a candidate
hand-picked by labor.
Third, inflationary meas-
ures may relieve their woes
temporarily but never cure
their ills.
