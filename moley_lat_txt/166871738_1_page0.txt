FOG FROM
KANSAS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

More than 60 years ago,
a great Kansan, William
Allen White, asked, "What's
the matter with Kansas?"
Last week at the Na-
tional Republican Club in
New York, a Republican
audience believed that they
perceived a pretty good
answer.
The speaker was Fred
Hall, Governor of Kansas.
The theme was the "dismal
situation" of the Republi-
can Party. The effort was to
show that President Eisen-
hower and the Republican
Party were two entirely
different things and that
the party had better "get in
step." The effect, if the
speech had made any sense,
would have been to open
old, wounds which, due to
the efforts of the President
over the last three years
and of Sen. Taft in the last
months of his life, have
been mending steadily
since the convention of
1952.

Both Taft and Dewey, Re-
publicans expressed deep
regret at Gov. Hall's dis-
course. The cream of the
jest was that Hall intended
the speech to be a monu-
mental tribute to the Presi-
dent, but the top Republi-
can leader in New York
County and a stalwart Dew-
ey man said in disgust that
the utterance was anti-
Eisenhower all the way
through.
The speech might well
have been uttered by Can-
didate Stevenson, except
that the Illinois man would
have done it more grace-
fully and intelligently.
In order to prove that
the President has been be-
trayed by the Republican
Party, Gov. Hall presented
a series of nonsensical il-
lustrations. He complained
that the "rural electrifica-
tion co-operatives" have
been offended by the "turn-
ing over" of Dixon-Yates
and Hell's Canyon to pri-
vate enterprise. But it was
not Congress but the Presi-
dent who made those deci-
sions. Hall bitterly attacked
the flexible support policy
now in effect, but failed to
realize that the President
and Secretary Benson have
been its sponsors and firm
adherents.
Hall's most brazen twist-
ing of facts to fit his impos-
sible case was to praise the
President but to shift to
the Republican Party the
blame for the Salk vaccine
debacle last spring.
â˜…
According to Hall, the
fact that Mrs. Hobby, as
Secretary of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare, de-
clared herself opposed to
socialized medicine makes
the Republican Party, not
Eisenhower, responsible for
the failure properly to in-
spect and test the vaccine.
But the power existed in
the Hobby department to
carry out the necessary in-
spection.
In Canada the vaccine
was successfully inspected
and used, although there is
no socialized medicine there.
Since the incident here, the
Eisenhower administration
has openly accepted the
blame for what happened
and did not happen. The
responsible officer was Mrs.
Hobby, appointed by and
subject to the direction of
the President. Finally, Mrs.
Hobby would be the last to
claim any affiliation with
the Republican "Old Guard,"
which Gov. Hall denounced.
For she is the wife of a
Democrat and former Gov-
ernor of Texas.
We shall have to go back
to the days of Jerry Simp-
son to find a Kansas states-
man with irresponsibility
equal to that of this young
Governor. But Simpson, the
Sockless Socrates of the
West, had an earthy, pun-
gent demagoguery missing
in this heir apparent.
