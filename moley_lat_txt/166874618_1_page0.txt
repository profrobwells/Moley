Among the many, many
economic forecasts that
have filled the mail these
last two weeks I found a
special fascination in an es-
say by Julius Hirsch con-
tained in a book edited by
him entitled "New Horizons
in Business."

My interest was aroused
for several reasons. In the
first place, I have known
Hirsch for several years,
and his long-term predic-
tions have been remarkably
accurate. Also, I found it
more interesting to consider
the long-term trends rather
than the course of events in
1956. Finally, there was an
element in the Hirsch es-
say that awakened my risi-
bilities from a numbness
induced by bad weather,
New Year's crowds, traffic,
and the other burdens we
bear in the so-called holi-
day season.

It seems that the basic
research on this important
subject of what is in store
for us over the next 20 years
was done for the Rock of
Ages Corp. and for the ben-
efit of the memorial indus-
try. The major product of
this industry is, lest you
have not guessed it, that
final economic problem that
faces all of usâ€”the tomb-
stone or marker, or what-
ever else reminds the rumi-
native wanderer that we
once lived here among men.
I imagine that this indus-
try summoned the econo-
mist because of the perilous
persistence of people to live
much, much longer lives.
Indeed, it is the one indus-
try which will, at least for
many years to come, feel no
Since Hirsch made his
original study in 1952 there
has been substantial proof
that his calculations were
remarkably correct. His
chart showing "gross na-
tional product" and "per
capita disposable personal
income" almost exactly pre-
dicted the slight dip which
we experienced at the end
of 1954 and the beginning
effect of the great war baby
boom of the 1940s. More-
over, the style seems to be
toward smaller markers
with less verbiage such as
poetry inscribed thereon.
The marker people are also
apparently (I have no sta-
tistics to prove this) alive to
the competition of those
great savers of space, the
crematories.

But here I am, half
through with a New Year's
piece without any predic-
tions.
of 1955. Then it takes off
for higher altitudes until
sometime around 1970.
Altogether, he expects
the gross national prod-
uct to double in the com-
ing 20 years, with real per
capita income rising about
two-thirds and consump-
tion almost doubling. The
work week, he anticipates,
will drop to 35 hours.
There will be changing
consumption demands, with
the percentage spent on
shoes, clothing and food
falling by about 28%, but
a great compensating in-
crease in consumer dur-
ables and services.

In agriculture the pros-
pective change is revolu-
tionary. Agricultural pro-
duction was approximately
8% in excess of needs in
1955. The total output in
order to supply the 40% in-
crease needed in the next
20 years would have to rise
only 32%. This means, ac-
cording to N. Koffsky of
the Department of Agricul-
ture (quoted by Hirsch),
that there should be a re-
duction of 20% in the num-
ber of farms over the next
20 years.

How the politicians can
meet this terrific economic
fact by finding the money
to keep uneconomic farms
and farmers going with sub-
sidies is difficult to say.
Moreover, how the Depart-
ment of the Interior can
justify bringing new land
into cultivation by very ex-
pensive irrigation projects
in the arid West is also dif-
ficult to forecast.

It would seem that the
future looks bright for all
of us unless we are farmers.
And if any of them expect
to survive, they had better
look to their efficiency.
