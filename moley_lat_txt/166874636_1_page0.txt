Flipping through some of
the slick brochures put out
by exponents of Federal rec-
lamation, one comes across
pairs of photographs remi-
niscent of the old patent
medicine "before and after"
gimmick.
On one side is a parched,
desolate, forsaken stretch of
land; not a prairie dog in
sight; on the other, the lush
green and gold pattern of
prosperous acres: white
farm buildings, fat cattle
and happy farmers in the
foreground.
This transition, the print
explains, was made possible
by a Federal reclamation
project. It is the magic
touch of water bought with
Federal money.

No such publicity attends
the bureau's failures where
good dry-farming land has
been ruined, where re-
claimed land has turned out
to be worthless for farm-
ing, where bankruptcy,
mortgage, debt and other
griefs have been the con-
stant companions of the un-
fortunate homesteader.
I have just received a let-
ter from a farmer who re-
lates his experience with
Federal reclamation. Here
is his story.
With the required capi-
tal, farming experience and
other merits this man ap-
plied for land in a recent
reclamation project.
"Unfortunately," he says,
"I qualified and was award-
ed by lot one of the units."
He moved onto the barren
landscape in 1953. Through
an FHA loan he met the re-
quirement of living with
his family on the land. He
began to dip into his life
savings, something over
$10,000, by converting his
machinery for irrigated
farming. Then he awaited
the abundance of precious
water.
It came. "But the first
crop failed because of the
difficulties in irrigating the
land and loss in the ditches.
So payments were made
out of livestock
some
of the irrigating difficulties
were due to unlevel land
although the units were
supposed to have been
leveled
"I found that on a short
field the water penetrated
15 feet at the end next to
the ditch and only 10 inches
to a foot at the lower end.
The soil was so sandy that
ditches seeped and washed
out and fields washed into
gullies at the top end and
silt buried crops at the low-
er end."
After living on the land
he found that only about
half of the advertised acre-
age in native grass existed,
and "that very poor... the
rest was dry, abandoned
farmland. The only im-
provement had been
scraping the topsoil
around .. I was forced to
pasture out my cattle 50
miles away and to buy al-
most all the winter feed for
them."
He was told that the
ditches, which were losing
50% of the water delivered,
would seal. "But they didn't
and many of the lower
farms began to have seep-
age on the surface and con-
sequent alkali problems.
"The second year was
worse. There was an aver-
age loss on all the farms of
over $2000." He became des-
perate, but was advised to
irrigate more intensively.
"I had been irrigating from
3 in the morning to
8 or 9 in the evening
one neighbor ran four
times the normal amount of
water in one row five times
and never reached the end
of the row."
To put it bluntly, he lost
his shirt. With all avenues
of recovery blocked for him
he was faced with foreclos-
ure. He advised his Con-
gressman and a survey was
undertaken by the Federal
agencies who were instru-
mental in the construction.
"Their report became con-
fidential, and I believe mini-
mized the troubles to quite
an extent.
"I am out my savings and
two years' work. The unit
stood idle this year pending
legislation since I had no
money with which to oper-
ate and also because I be-
lieved any money expended
would be lost."
This is not an isolated
case. Persons within the
bureau who wish to remain
anonymous have shown me
what their bureau will not
publish: the facts, demon-
strated in hard figures, that
we have already gone far
beyond the point of dimin-
ishing returns in recent ir-
rigation projects, and that
little if any land remains in
the West that would be
sound irrigation undertak-
ings from an economic
standpoint.
TODAY IN HISTORY
BY BRAINERD DYER
Nov. 18. 1883, the rail-
roads of the United States
put into effect the system
of time zones now known
as standard time.
Geographers and meteor-
ologists, individually and
in national and internation-
al meetings, had long urged
the selection of a common
prime meridian for reckon-
ing longitude and regulat-
ing time, but it was the
practical needs of railroads
that eventually led to ac-
tion.
Railroad schedules based
on sun time were impos-
sible and consequently each
road established its own
time zones. Many a town,
served by several lines and
faced with several different
variations of sun time,
found the confusion almost
hopeless. Railroad stations
frequently displayed three
or four clocks each set ac-
cording to a different zone
system.
A convention of railway
superintendents and man-
agers, meeting in St. Louis
in April, recommended the
adoption of four time zones
each 15 degs. or one
hour in width, in accord-
ance with a suggestion
made some years before by
Prof. Charles David of Sar-
atoga, N.Y. By October,
roads with a total trackage
of over 78,000 miles had
agreed and on Nov. 18 the
new system was put into
operation. Not until 1918
did standard time receive
governmental sanction.
