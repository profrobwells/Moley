Adlai Stevenson may not
get the nomination. I am
inclined to believe that in
one or more of the many
primary contests Sen. Ke-
fauver may deal him a
mortal blow without, how-
ever, bringing the nomina-
tion to himself.
But as excesses of Au-
thor Truman and Aspirant
Kefauver grow greater, the
moderation of Stevenson
becomes more and more
soothing to the ear. If any-
thing can bring the man
from Illinois to the brink
of statesmanship, it is the
dismal prospect offered by
the tactics of Truman-Ke-
fauver.
"A man's moderation,"
said Irving Babbitt in his
almost forgotten book,
"Democracy and Leader-
ship," "is measured by his
success in mediating be-
tween some sound general
principle and the infinitely
various and shifting cir-
cumstances of actual life."
Of course, as Babbitt add-
ed, the man of moderation
"must dispose of the ques-
tion of truth or error be-
fore he can properly begin
to moderate at all. Other-
wise he will run the risk of
resembling the English
statesman of whom it was
said that he never deviated
from the straight and nar-
row path between right and
wrong."
It is not clear what the
philosophical home base is
from which Stevenson
judges the immediate prob-
lems that confront the na-
tion. Perhaps he would if
put to it decide that his
ideology differs very little
from that of Eisenhower.
Perhaps his home philo-
sophical stance is identical
with that of Kefauver, ex-
cept that Stevenson is
more honest in his criti-
cisms of the opposition.
In any event, he is a man
of sensitivity and truthful-
ness who is unwilling to
prostitute his position by
making promises that no
rational person could ex-
pect to fulfill.
Nothing of the sort can
be said of the Truman-Ke-
fauver line. The Tennessee
Senator had the gall to
stand before an informed
audience in California and
bring up the Trinity River
Project as an instance by
which to condemn Secre-
tary McKay as a faithless
custodian of the nation's
resources.
Eastern readers may be
induced to subscribe to that
conclusion only because
they do not realize that the
Trinity River Project was
passed by the last Congress
and that the Democratic
Congressman who was its
immedate sponsor has no
reproaches for the admin-
istration in the circum-
stances surrounding its
passage.
More serious than this
attack by innuendo was
Kefauver's bald statement
that the Eisenhower ad-
ministration "has not made
a single start on a water
resource project since it
came into power." The fact
is that the Eisenhower ad-
ministration has, in some
cases I believe, unwisely,
presented to Congress a
number of projects for au-
thorization which the Tru-
man administration had
consistently sidetracked.
If they failed, it was be-
cause of the opposition of
members of Congress, most-
ly of Kefauver's own party.
Meanwhile, in the East
Mr. Truman indulged him-
self in an orgy of billings-
gate. One charge, for which
he was unable to produce
a single scrap of evidence,
was that somewhere, some-
time Vice-President Nixon
had called him a "traitor."
When in Boston the for-
mer President was pressed
for exact specifications, he
said merely that Nixon
had said it "all over the
West." When he returned
to New York, he said in re-
ply to the same question
that "all I did was read the
papers."
Later, some unnamed
spokesman for the unrelia-
ble man from Independ-
ence, apparently trying to
perform a rescue operation,
said that Nixon had said
"traitor" in private confer-
ences, not in speeches, and
that unnamed "prominent
people" had reported it to
Mr. Truman.
At any rate, Author Tru-
man made plenty of head-
lines which should sell
plenty of books when his
next opus is placed on the
market next month. Per-
haps it was the enterpris-
ing author, rather than the
statesman, talking.
