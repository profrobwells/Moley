HARVARD'S
POWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The final report of Don-
ald K. David, signalizing
his retirement as dean of
the Graduate School of
Business Administration at
Harvard, provides a vívíd
example of the immense
power that the Ford Foun-
dation is exercising over
academic institutions of
even the highest rank.

And that influence, it
seems, will be directed to-
ward the adoption by such
institutions of a very spe-
cial type of research which
seems to have possessed
the foundation since the
beginning of its career un-
der Paul Hoffman and
Robert Hutchins.

It seems that during the
last year the Ford Founda-
tion bestowed upon the
school a grant of $2,000,000
for research, with a strong
hint that it be used in large
part to "further the in-
creased use of the behav-
ioral sciences, especially
sociology, psychology and
anthropology, in research
in and teaching of business
administration." When
3 billion dollars gives a
hint, of course, it is a com-
mand.

It is interesting that
Dean David is also a direc-
tor of the Ford Founda-
tion, which raises the point
of what might be called a
community of interests. It
is more blessed to give
than to receive. But when
you can give and receive at
the same time, you may
consider yourself twice
blessed.

It is also interesting to
note that the dean's report
was sent to graduates of
the school with a covering
letter from Thomas H.
Carroll, who is not only
president of the alumni as-
sociation but vice-presi-
dent of the Ford Founda-
tion.

The dean's report points
out that research under-
taken in the school "must
represent the specific in-
terests of the individual
members of the faculty."
Apparently the "specific
interests" of the present
members of the faculty do
not provide the preoccupa-
tion with "behaviorism" so
dear to the Ford people.
Accordingly, new talent is
to be summoned in the per-
son of Prof. Samuel A.
Stouffer of the department
of social relations across
the Charles River.

Dr. Stouffer is well fitted
to lead the business school
into the mysterious "sci-
entism" desired by the
Ford Foundation. He has
been a member of no less
than four Ford advisory
committees.

During the war he served
in the so-called Information
and Education Division of
the War Department. Mainly,
according to ex-service-
men, that operation was
intent upon performing as
many curious behavioristic
experiments as possible
while the human guinea
pigs were under what so-
cial scientists call "con-
trol." He is coauthor of
"The American Soldier," a
work which will be bitter-
ly remembered by many
responsible Army officers.

At the University of Chi-
cago and later at Harvard
he was able to conduct his
"controlled" problems on
sophomores. At the busi-
ness school Dr. Stouffer
will work with a team of
the faculty leading toward
a "new long-range program
of research in the area of
consumer behavior."

One graduate of the
school said, after reading
of the expected visitation
of Dr. Stouffer, that appar-
ently "controlled experi-
ments" which have hither-
to been possible only on
(a) soldiers, (b) sopho-
mores, (c) guests in State
institutions will now be
performed upon (d) cus-
tomers for the benefit of
prospective marketing ex-
perts.

So the old rule that the
customer is a supreme be-
ing who always is right will
no longer have that dis-
tinction. He is to become
a guinea pig along with
many other formerly free
citizens.

Lawyers well remember
the invasion of the be-
haviorists of the law schools
and the strange sociolog-
ical-judicial opinions we
have seen in recent years.
Now business management
is to have its turn.
