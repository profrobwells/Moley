SOME NEW CHEEKS TO TURN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is hard to understand
how a self-respecting politi-
cal party can accept meek-
ly the hostility of the dom-
inating labor bosses toward
the Eisenhower administra-
tion and Republican candi-
dates generally.
But apparently Secretary
of Labor Mitchell is still
finding new cheeks to turn.
At least two Republican
Governors and Sen. Case
of New Jersey seem to be
afflicted with the Mitchell
brand of humility.
One of those Governors,
Knight of California, has
humbled the office he holds
and mortified his former
supporters by his abject
tributes to labor leaders in
his State. Gov. Hall of Kan-
sas, after his ridiculous
speech in New York last
month, cannot be taken se-
riously.

In an interview Secretary
Mitchell said, after the
AFL-CIO marriage, a num-
ber of things that need to be
challenged. For they show
a complete failure to face
the realities. He said that
"Federal law permits only
political contributions as
such from union members."
This ignores the fact that
only last year members of
the UAW asked the Michi-
gan Legislature to pass a
law preventing union dues
from being used for political
purposes. It also ignores the
fact that under all sorts of
phony facades some unions
publish newspapers and
pay for programs on the air
which are full of political
propaganda.
Mitchell also said naive-
ly that "if Meany and Reu-
ther mean what they say,
and by Harriman and Ste-
venson were all of a pat-
tern. They denounced the
Eisenhower administration
as a class outfit and by co-
incidence offered, in the
main, the same examples of
unfavorable statements
made about various mem-
bers of the administration
and the Vice-President.
If there is not a firm of-
fensive and defensive alli-
ance between these labor
leaders and the left wing of
the Democratic Party, then
words have lost their mean-
ing. And if that alliance is
not sufficiently powerful to
dominate the Democratic
Party, then all calculations
of probability are wrong.

Since these labor leaders
have chosen to cast the first
stone, the strategy of the
Republican Party can only
be what Sen. Taft adopted
in 1950 in Ohio. That is to
prove to the rank-and-file
members of unions that
their leaders are engaged in
tactics which are unfair and
injurious to all Americans,
in and out of unions.
The exceedingly well-in-
formed Victor Riesel in one
of his newspaper articles re-
ports that in this difference
of opinion between the
Mitchell group, which fa-
vors further attempts to win
over Meany and Reuther,
and the Goldwater group,
which favors the Taft meth-
od, President Eisenhower
has decided to support Gold-
water. He apparently has
decided that the time has
come when humility has
ceased not only to be a vir-
tue but good politics as well.
