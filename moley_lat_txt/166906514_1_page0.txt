THE ATTACK ON IKE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is, to borrow from
"September Song," a long,
long time from now to
November, but the pattern
of what will be said is al-
ready clearly before us.
This is especially true since
it now seems to be assured
that the President will run
again and that Nixon will
be the Vice-Presidential
candidate.
The attack from the op-
position will appear in
various forms, ranging
from mild insinuation to
unvarnished rancor. It will
be said that in re-electing
the President we will be
getting a "part-time" pub-
lic servant and a serious
actuarial risk..
*
Consequently, the quali-
ties of the candidate for
Vice-President will serious-
ly be called into question.
Sen. Morse comes close to
leading the pack by saying
that we have had "a regen-
cy and a part-time President
since his inauguration" and
that it will be the "duty of
the Democratic Party to
document his sorry record."
There seems to be a deep
conviction on the part of
some of the reporters who
have been questioning Dr.
White and others that the
President should work in
full view of all for a period
of eight hours a day and
that his vacation periods
should be limited to four
weeks. No doubt it is be-
lieved by some that he
should be docked for his
two-hour period in the mid-
dle of the day.
A bit of cogitation by a
reasonable person should
provide the conviction
that the rest in the middle
of the day is exactly what
might be prescribed for
any person whose value in
his job depends upon sound
judgment and a clear mind
in making decisions. A job
is not merely activity, un-
less we are talking about
a prize fighter or a traffic
policeman. The President's
job needs detachment from
detail, respite from routine,
and protection from boring
visitors and purely cere-
monial social obligations.
Let us all apply a sane
rule to our own jobs or the
jobs we would like to do.
Consider the unnecessary
burdens we are likely to
put upon our physical re-
sources and our time. Con-
sider how badly organized
we are generally. Consider
what we eat and drink out
of habit that might be dis-
pensed with. Certainly it
is not work that kills us
before our time. It is the
foolish dissipation of
energy, the unnecessary
labor that we incur because
we are unwilling to take
time out to plan.
Sometimes it is a serious
illness such as a siege of
tuberculosis, the shock of
an accident, the ordeal of
an operation, or, as in the
President's case, a warn-
ing outcry from an over-
strained heart that teaches
us to live a more ordered
existence, and withal a
longer life.
More important is a look
at the life span at 60 or, as
in the President's case, at
65. We are reminded, as
was Emerson, that "there's
not enough for this or
that." After that milepost,
the man whose duty is
deeply felt and who has
many things to do before
the end measures his steps
and increases rather than
lessens his yearly product.

The American people
might well consider how
fair President Eisenhower
has been with them in lay-
ing bare his physical condi-
tion, in measuring his ac-
tivity in order to serve his
country better, and in giv-
ing of his genius for organ-
ization in making more
efficient a job that in the
past has been one of the
most disorderly in the
world. Might not we all be
thankful for that? And
measure a man's worth by
the results achieved rath-
er than by jealously count-
ing his holidays and hours
at his desk.
We are the employers,
and if we are wise we will
give the award to the em-
ployee who does his job
with the least apparent ef-
fort and, what is most im-
portant, the least noise.
