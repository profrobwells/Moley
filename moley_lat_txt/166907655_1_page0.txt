ON AID FOR SCHOOLS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The President's proposals
for Federal aid for school
construction are lacking in
some of the defects which
characterized last year's
plans. But the difficulty of
getting action from a polit-
ically minded Congress is
greater than ever. Indeed,
it may well be that any
possible formula for distrib-
uting Federal aid cannot
be enacted.
If that proves to be true,
the President and Congress
might well adopt the course
which would have been bet-
ter in any event, which
would be to return some of
the tax resources now mo-
nopolized by the Federal
government to the States
and local communities and
let them build their own
schools.
Under the present plan
there would be outright
grants plus the purchase of
bonds from school districts
sufficient to build 60,000
additional classrooms over
the next five years. This
number, added to the 410,-
000 which the States and lo-
cal communities can build,
would bring the number of
additional rooms up to the
guess that 470,000 will be
needed.
This figure, 470,000, has
been tossed around with
such abandon that in some
cases it is understood to be
the number which the
States and communities
cannot build for them-
selves. That, as an examin-
ation of the facts proves, is
not correct.
In any event, it is a fig-
ure pulled out of the air.
The U.S. Bureau of Educa-
tion itself admits that "it is
impossible to state the ex-
act number of additional
classrooms today or the
precise number that will be
needed over a period of
years."
The White House confer-
ence, despite the neat way
in which its final report was
engineered by the National
Education Association,
showed equal ignorance of
need. It said that "no State
represented has a demon-
strated financial incapacity
to build the schools it will
need during the next five
years," but that because of
politics most States lacked
the courage to tax their
people enough to meet their
needs.
It was upon the basis of
this lack of courage that
they decided to throw the
job on the Federal govern-
ment.
For the building of the
60,000 rooms that the gov-
ernment guesses will satis-
fy the clamor—which is
exactly what the request
for Federal money means
—the money appropriated
will, according to the Bu-
reau of Education, be allo-
cated in accordance with a
formula which will recog-
nize need rather than mere
want.
Federal funds would be
distributed according to
the relative income per
child in the State. Thus,
the poorest State in terms
of its income as compared
with its children would get
three times as much as the
States with the largest in-
come per child. Under this
plan the highest premiums
would go to Alabama, Ar-
kansas, Mississippi, North
Carolina and South Caro-
lina. The lowest would go
to Connecticut, New Jer-
sey, New York, Delaware,
California and Nevada.

There would, however,
be a modification of this
rating—a correction based
upon "effort." In short,
States which have shown
more energy and ingenuity
in meeting their needs
would get a premium.
If any benighted person
believes that Congress will
pass any such bureaucratic
formula as this, he wholly
misunderstands the mind
of a Congressman. For the
richer States will insist on
a straight per pupil allot-
ment, which would destroy
the entire principle of giv-
ing only to the needy.
My own suggestion
would be that a sufficient
number of the more profit-
able tax sources now col-
lected by the Federal gov-
ernment be relinquished to
the States. Then let the
States build their own
schools with money which
is now exacted from their
citizens by the Federal gov-
ernment. It is just as
simple as that.
