SCHOOL PLATITUDES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a previous article I
described the musical chairs
arrangement at the recent
White House Conference on
Education by which the
1800-odd lay people who
were present were eliminat-
ed from the final activities
and the professional educa-
tor politicians took over.
The compensation of the
vitally important report on
financing schools was ac-
tually done by only two of
that species. This report
was the nub of the whole
story, for it said that Fed-
eral aid was needed not
only for buildings but for
other things educational as
well.
Thus, the politicians tri-
umphed down to the end.
No county convention in
the darkest ages of Amer-
ican politics was more deft-
ly handled.

Through a masterpiece
of political double-talk, the
reports called for Federal
aid but never once specified
what States or communities
needed the aid. The fact is
that Adam S. Bennion of
Utah—a member of the
Council of 12 of the Mormon
Church, chairman of the
Utah Public School Com-
mission, and recently chair-
man of the committee on
Federal responsibility of
the President's Commission
on Intergovernmental Rela-
tions—who was one of the
laymen finally eliminated,
demanded over and over
the specifications of where
and how much Federal aid
was needed.
But "specifications" is a
word absent from the bright
lexicon of politics.
Instead, the educationists
offer us a monumental mess
of platitudes, educational
and welfare gobbledygook,
and clichés. There are lots
and lots of "challenges,"
"avenues of approach,"
"dynamics," "orientations,"
and "evaluations." Plenty of
long gray polysyllabic
nothings, but no figures.
Also, earthshaking eva-
sions:
"'Enough' good teachers
implies enough teachers in
the classrooms to develop
each child to his full
potential, taking into ac-
count the educational serv-
ice to be rendered in that
particular classroom."
*
"Education, as an Amer-
ican heritage, is a public
enterprise and responsibil-
ity, basic to democracy, and
as such requires for its
wholesome growth the
active concern, support, and
participation of the public."
But tucked away in the
final report of the school
building session at the con-
ference is this admission:
"The general consensus
was this: No State repre-
sented has a demonstrated
financial incapacity to build
the schools it will need dur-
ing the next five years. But
with the exception of a few
States none of the States
presently has plans which
indicate a political deter-
mination powerful enough
to overcome all the obsta-
cles."
How that escaped the
political ax I don't know,
but it is the truth.
In plain English it means
that the States can very well
attend to their needs but
that the politicians in those
States lack the intestinal
fortitude to raise the money.
For that lack of courage
they now come whining to
the Federal government to
give them a handout.
And for this crass exploi-
tation of the White House,
the taxpayers pick up the
tab for $900,000!
