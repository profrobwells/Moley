POWER OF SPLINTERS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Action in the Senate has
disposed, for this session,
of the question of a new
method of electing the
President and Vice-Presi-
dent. But a number of issues
raised remain with us
always. Notable among
these is the dominance of
minorities in our system of
government and the zeal
with which politicians re-
sist efforts to reduce the
power of these groups.
No one who loves liberty
will deny the right of
minorities to be protected
from the irrational power
of mass majorities. But in
the case of some of the
minorities involved in pres-
ent political decisions, the
heart of the matter is not
protection of legitimate
rights but dominance
through the exercise of
what is called balance of
power.

Briefly stated, there were
proposed to the Senate
three alternatives to our
present method of electing
the President and Vice-
President. All are based
upon the basic defect in
the present method, which
permits the casting of the
entire electoral vote of a
State for the party candi-
dates who may get an
insignificant marginal ma-
jority.
One alternative is to
elect the President and
Vice-President by a straight
popular vote over the na-
tion, which would further
obliterate State lines. No
one seems to be for this but
Sen. Langer and Mrs.
Smith of Maine.
Sen. Langer is for any-
thing which he thinks he
can sell to the "peeple."
Mrs. Smith makes little
contribution to the political
value of the vote of her
sex by the fantastic reason
which she seems to suggest
for favoring a plebiscite. It
is because there are more
women than men.
Apparently the thing she
anticipates at some time in
the future is a national
division of parties based
upon sex. Thus a national
Lysistrata, with the women
taking over.

The Daniels - Kefauver
plan would provide for
each State a division of the
electoral vote in exact or
almost exact proportion to
the vote in that State.
Thus, if New York should
cast 55% of its vote for
Candidate A and 45% for
Candidate B, the former
would get 25 of the State's
45 votes and the latter
would get 20. In the case
of New York, the Liberal
Party might get two or
three if it had a candidate
of its own. The objection
to this is that it would en-
courage such splinters as
the Liberal (nuisance) Par-
ty in other States.
objection to this is that
there would be no way, as
the measure stands, to pre-
vent gerrymandering the
State so that the districts
would not represent equal
and contiguous units.
In my judgment either
the Daniels-Kefauver plan
or the Mundt-Coudert plan
would be better than the
present antiquated system,
but it would also seem that
if the Senate can take days
on end for windy oratory
it might devise a method
to eliminate the defects in
the Mundt-Coudert plan.
The Senate, however, is
not interested in devising
a better plan. It is inter-
ested, it would seem, in
what each Senator might
or might not gain. The en-
tire debate has been a
study of local party and in-
dividual interest, punctu-
ated by utter insincerity.
The real objections to a
change will continue to be
the determination on the
part of minorities to give
up none of their power.
The Mundt-Coudert plan
would retain the Electoral
College and elect in New
York, for example, 43 elec-
tors in the various Con-
gressional districts and two
at large in the State. The
