THE GREAT
UNTAUGHT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Some time ago in this
column I described the al-
most unbelievable lack of
knowledge of her govern-
ment in a high school stu-
dent whose standing in her
classes was of the best.

She was able to say that
the Fifth Amendment
meant that "you don't have
to say you are a Commu-
nist," but she did not know
what the Fifth Amendment
was an amendment of.

She knew nothing of the
Bill of Rights or of the
Constitution itself. But her
current-events teacher (a
college graduate from
Michigan and an admirer of
Gov. Mennen Williams)
was teaching the children
all about the French prob-
lems in North Africa and
segregation in the South.

Now there comes to hand
an interesting account of a
poll taken in a large insti-
tution in this country to
determine how much col-
lege students knew of their
own government. This was
published in the bulletin
of an organization known
as the Citizenship Clearing
House of New York Uni-
versity, which is interested
in stimulating college stu-
dents to take more interest
in politics.

I do not care to name the
college or the State in which
it is located. The poll
covered 1550 undergradu-
ate students, men and
women. Three questions
were submitted which
were intended to test the
student's knowledge of na-
tional, State, and interna-
tional affairs.

On the national level, the
students were asked to
identify by name their
U.S. Senators, their Con-
gressmen, and the Secre-
taries of State and Com-
merce in Washington.

Students answering were
marked "well informed" if
they could name four; aver-
age if they could name two,
and poor if they could
name one or none. Only
18% could name four; 55%
could name only two, and
27% could name only one
or none at all.

It should be said that
both the Senators in the
State where the over-
whelming majority of the
students live have been in
office a considerable time,
and one of the two is an
outstanding figure in his
party. In fact, he is promi-
nently discussed in connec-
tion with the Presidency or
Vice-Presidency.

The poll results show
that the women students
were somewhat more poor-
ly informed than the men.

On the State level, the
students were asked to
name the Governor and
Lieutenant Governor, their
State Senators, and Assem-
blymen. Of course, it can be
taken for granted that al-
most nobody knows his
representative in the State
Legislature. But in this
case, 71% could not name
more than one of these offi-
cials.

The international ques-
tion: "Who is the Russian
Premier?" "Thirty-two per
cent were unable to name
Bulganin.

In the light of this de-
plorable state of ignorance
among people who are priv-
ileged to go to college and
perhaps to consider them-
selves the intellectual elite,
the resolution of the Ameri-
can Association of Univer-
sity Professors that Com-
munists and Fifth Amend-
ment refugees should be al-
lowed to teach comes with
poor grace.

It might be suggested to
the 37,000 members of that
allegedly learned body of
American educators that,
before they have a right to
discuss the qualifications of
teachers, they indicate a bit
more competence in what
they themselves are doing.
Perhaps, indeed, the igno-
rance thus revealed among
students is merely a reflec-
tion of the benighted state
of the professors.
