BLESSED BY
LABORITES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a column prepared
for publication just before
the shocking acid-throwing
attack upon him, Labor
Columnist Victor Riesel
suggests that the political
wise men in the labor
movement are quietly dis-
counting Stevenson, Ke-
fauver and Harriman. He
ventures the suggestion
that they may prefer Sen.
Symington of Missouri.
Riesel points out that
Symington has been on
good terms with both AFL
and CIO chieftains for a
long time. He favored the
guaranteed annual wage
well before Reuther took it
up.

These political labor
leaders are very practical
people. They are well
aware of the basic weak-
nesses of the three lead-
ing candidates. Stevenson
never aroused their enthu-
siasm, although in 1952 he
toed their mark in a rather
gingerly fashion. Kefauver
stands for practically
everything that the PAC
and the ADA want, but
since he is opposed by so
many Democratic politi-
cians, his chances of nomi-
nation are not too good, de-
spite his primary suc-
cesses. And these labor
chieftains want not only a
man who agrees with them
but a candidate who can
be nominated.
Harriman has been most
abject in truckling to the
labor bosses. Some of his
speeches over the last four
years would indicate a will-
ingness to head what might
be a national labor govern-
ment. But there are hard
facts which would make
him extremely vulnerable
in a national campaign.
He would have to as-
sume the responsibility of
defending most of the war-
time decisions of Roosevelt
and the postwar policies of
Truman, since he took part
in so many of them him-
self. This would put him in
a defensive position â€” a
great handicap in a candi-
date for a party that is out
of office trying to get in.
This year the Eisenhower
record will be at issue, not
those of Roosevelt and Tru-
man.

Another major weakness
of Harriman is his Tam-
many sponsorship. Car-
mine De Sapio, the head of
Tammany Hall, is Harri-
man's manager and spon-
sor. That sort of sponsor-
ship was too great a bur-
den for even as great a
man as Al Smith.
On the other hand, New
Yorkers such as Tilden,
Cleveland, Hughes and
Dewey found their opposi-
tion to Tammany a great
national asset.
The infamous attack
upon Victor Riesel may
well have very important
political repercussions. Sel-
dom has an underworld at-
tack so moved the con-
science of the city of New
York. The bitter feeling
thus engendered will put
in motion a wave of resent-
ment against all interfer-
ence by labor leaders in
politics.
It will be said, as a New
York newspaper already
has pointed out, that un-
less labor is able to govern
itself, it is in a poor position
to dictate the political des-
tinies of the State, the na-
tion and the world.
*
Aside from all collateral
considerations, the misfor-
tune that has befallen Vic-
tor Riesel is indeed tragic.
As a fellow journalist, I
could hardly pay a higher
tribute than to say that
Riesel comes closer to in-
dispensability than any
other writer in the field of
journalism. His material is
unique because his entire
background prepared him
to report on labor affairs.
His articles have been
meaty, fair and utterly
courageous. It is good
news that the public will
still be able to read them.
