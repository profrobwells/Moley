EXPENSIVE
TRADE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
More than one observant
commentator on democracy
has concluded that it car-
ries with it seeds of its own
destruction. One of the
most threatening of those
inner infirmities is the cal-
lous habit of legislators re-
vealed in trading of votes.
In our textbooks this is
called "logrolling."
in the old days, when
tariff bills were written hy
Congressional committees
in an atmosphere of un-
principled barter, the "pro-
gressives" at that time
screamed in holy indigna-
tion.
In these days legislative
tariff making- indeed, all
tariff making is a minor
matter, and the ideological
descendants of those "pro-
gressives" are silent in the
face of much more perni-
cious logrolling. The new
form is costing the Ameri-
can people vastly more
than even the most glaring
specimens of special privi-
lege in tariff making.
*
In putting together the
various projects in the Up-
per Colorado development,
which passed earlier in this
session, there was unhe-
lievable logrolling. More-
over, it is quite clear that
the White House support-
ed the measure because
many Republican Senators
and Congressmen wanted
it. Thus, the vice of which
I speak is not limited to
one party or to any one
section of a party.
A most recent example
is contained in a report of
a deal between Speaker
Sam Rayburn and Republi-
can Congressman J. Edgar
Chenoweth of Colorado.
The Washington City News
Service said on June 6:
"Rep. J. Edgar Cheno-
weth (R) Colo, said he has
reached an agreement with
Speaker Sam Rayburn
that Rayburn will give the
'green light' to the $156,-
000,000 Frying Pan-Arkan-
sas project, if Chenoweth
'co-operates' on a commit-
tee vote on the pending
Hells Canyon Dam project.
"The Frying Pan-Arkan-
sas project has been bot-
tled up in the House Rules
Committee for two
months, Chenoweth said.
"The proposed Hells
Canyon Dam, on the Snake
River in Idaho, has heen
approved by a House In-
terior Subcommittee and
awaits a full committee
vote.
*
"Chenoweth told a re-
porter he was sure that
the Frying Pan-Arkansas
project would be approved
by the Rules Committee in
time for Congress to com-
plete action on the bill this
year."
The half-billion-dollar
project for a Federal dam
at Hells Canyon was be-
fore Congress for several
years. Finally the Federal
Power Commission, after
hearings and deliberations
for two years, granted a
license to the Idaho Power
Co. to build three dams
with private investors'
money. The Idaho Power
Co. is hard at work in the
canyon.
But since Sens. Morse
and Magnuson are to fight
for their jobs this year,
National Chairman Paul
Butler has demanded sup-
port for the Federal hill,
which would upset the de-
cision of the Federal Pow-
er Commission.
â˜…
The Frying Pan project
would gather water on the
west slope of the Rockies
and channel it through a
gigantic hole in the moun-
tains to the Arkansas Riv-
er. This is violently op-
posed by the victims on the
west slope, but they have
fewer voters and fewer
Congressmen.
The net cost of this Ray-
burn-Chenoweth deal, if it
should decide the issue,
would, on the estimates of
the bureaucrats, he $555-
000,000, and if previous es-
timates and costs are any
guide, the real cost would
be close to $1,500,000,000.
No doubt the Niagara bill,
which is supposed to help
the wobbling chances for
re-election of Sen. Lehman
of New York, will be in
the deal.
In the face of these bare-
faced deals, we may won-
der whether there are any
real defenders of the na-
tional interest.
TODAY IN HISTORY
BY BRAINERD DYER
"What a glorious day!!
have always wanted to die
on just such a day," ex-
claimed Maximilian, the 35-
year-old French-supported
puppet Emperor of Mexico,
on the morning of June 19,
1867, as he left his quarters
to face the firing squad on
a hill on the outskirts of
Queretaro.
Faced with repeated pro-
tests from the United
States, France had with-
drawn her troops from
Mexico early in the year,
but Maximilian had refused
to leave. Soon captured by
Mexican forces, he was
tried by court-martial on
13 charges, chief of which
was the infringement of the
peace, freedom and inde-
pendence of Mexico. By
vote of 4 to 3 he was sen-
tenced to death rather than
banishment for life.
With two faithful gener-
als, also sentenced to die,
Maximilian faced the squad
of seven soldiers on the
morning of the 19th. His
turn was first. Pierced by
five of the seven bullets, he
fell to the ground face
downward. A final shot,
fired at a range so close
that it scorched the Em-
peror's clothes, ended his
life.
Guilty primarily of bad
judgment in accepting an
invitation to become Em-
peror of Mexico and in re-
fusing to leave with the
French troops, Maximilian
was worthy of lighter pun-
ishment. Justice might well
have been served by ban-
ishment.
