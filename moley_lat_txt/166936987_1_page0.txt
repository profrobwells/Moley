AILMENT
`RACE?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Since the high command
of the Democratic National
Committee, meaning the
Hon. Paul M. Butler, is so
anxious to drag all possible
political advantage from
the President's state of
health, let us have full dis-
closure concerning all can-
didates or potential can-
didates on both sides. Let
us therefore turn this cam-
paign into a physiological
seminar. Issues will be
who's-had-what, and we
shall view with alarm every
past and present symptom.
Indeed, the U.S. News &
World Report has per-
formed an energetic job of
journalism in the current
issue by listing the disease
records and the history of
all operations on several
Presidential possibilities.

Except for the President,
Republicans seem to have
the better records. Nixon
has had a tonsillectomy.
Knowland has a perfect
record — no diseases, no
operations, no injuries.
Dewey had only bursitis,
which was relieved in 1951
by a surgical operation.
Gov. Christian Herter suf-
fers from arthritis which,
according to a statement
made by him in a television
program, makes it difficult
to stand very long or walk
very far.
U.S. News reports that
he also had a "noncancer-
ous tumor removed from
lung in 1951."
On the Democratic side,
Sen. Kefauver seems to be
the most fit — that is
physically. His only opera-
tion was a tonsillectomy.
This has not impaired his
capacity to put his foot in
his mouth.
Lyndon B. Johnson, Sen-
ator from Texas, as most
newspaper readers know,
suffered a heart attack in
1955. U.S. News also lists
a cystoscopic removal of a
kidney stone in 1948 and
the removal of a larger one
by the same method in
1955.

Adlai Stevenson seems to
have an affinity for the
same sort of trouble, for he
had a cystoscopic removal
of a small kidney stone in
1948 and a larger one in
1955.
Harriman, Governor of
New York, is listed as hav-
ing suffered from an ulcer
while helping President
Roosevelt get ready for war
in 1940. Apparently the on-
set of war brought about a
cure. But on May 21, 1956,
according to U.S. News, he
had "prostate gland re-
moved by surgery." Since
then he has thrown his hat
in the ring.
Sen. Stuart Symington,
according to the same
source, suffered from hy-
pertension and in 1947 had
an operation to relieve
that condition. He also had
a "fatty cyst" removed
from his eye in 1955.
The record does not de-
scribe the physical problem
suffered by Harry S. Tru-
man recently, but since he
is at least a possible candi-
date the facts should be
brought out before the
Democratic convention.

Since the king-making
columnists are already pro-
posing Chief Justice War-
ren as substitute candidate,
all of his ailments should
be spread into the record.
Since Chairman Butler
raises the question, let us
have still further full dis-
closure. Let us have all the
medical histories, including
all psychiatric treatments.
As Bugs Baer might say,
"Let him who is without
sin cast the first kidney
stone."
It's a pity that Bernarr
Macfadden might not have
lived to witness this great
and solemn referendum on
"body culture."
