COURT VS.
STATES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If the Supreme Court in
barring the enforcement of
State sedition laws had
been as zealous in its study
of what pundits call "psy-
chological phenomena" as
it was in the segregation
case, it might have hit up-
on a simple human fact.
It would have learned
that the most effective way
to kill the initiative of State
law enforcement officers is
to have the Federal govern-
ment step in. This is cer-
tainly a fact that the Chief
Justice, with his long ex-
perience as a county and
State law enforcement of-
ficer, should know.

In 1933, when I was offi-
cially connected with the
government, President
Roosevelt asked me to
make a report on law en-
forcement in two fields-
kidnaping and racketeering
-in which both Federal
and State laws prevailed.
Before undertaking this as-
signment, I consulted with
the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, Hat-
ton Sumners of Dallas, Tex.
His great concern in Fed-
eral legislation, as he relat-
ed it to me, was to main-
tain the vigor and initia-
tive of State and local law
officers. Whenever, he said,
the Federal authority en-
ters the picture, local effi-
ciency lags. And law en-
forcement by the Federal
government, he contended,
can never be a substitute
for that form of enforce-
ment which is close to the
persons and conditions in-
volved.
The Supreme Court has,
in its ruling, not only en-
couraged local indifference
but has actually command-
ed it. There is no sense at
all in the court's statement
that a "dominant interest
of the Federal government
in the problem precludes
State intervention."
The Federal govern-
ment's interest in sedition
actually needs and requires
State and local co-opera-
tion. Unless we are to have
a Federal gestapo and all
of the evils of a police state,
the Federal authorities
must have local and State
co-operation at all times.
Indeed, the watchful eyes
of the local community
must be the means of spot-
ting violations of either
Federal or State law.
The Supreme Court's
majority opinion also said
that the "administration of
State acts would conflict
with the operation of the
Federal plan." This is
sharply contradicted by
something the Justice De-
partment said in the pro-
ceedings before the de-
cision. The representative
of the department said that
during the 15 years in
which there were both
Federal and State laws on
the subject of sedition,
there had never been an
impediment or embarrass-
ment in the Federal gov-
ernment's enforcement of
the Smith Act.
Sen. Bridges has intro-
duced a bill which if passed
might measurably repair
the damage which the Su-
preme Court has done. It
would provide that the
Federal law should not in
any way interfere with the
enforcement of State stat-
utes on the subject of sedi-
tion.

It would seem that the
majority opinion of the
court reflects a profound
distrust in the discretion
and sense of justice of the
States. This is serious busi-
ness, for to take such a po-
sition is to challenge the
very essence of our govern-
ment.
The dissenting opinion
of Justice Reed makes
clear what our traditions
mean. It cites a section in
the codified criminal laws
of the United States which
appears in the same title
of those laws in which the
Smith Act appears:
"Nothing in this title
shall be held to take away
or impair the jurisdiction
of the courts of the several
States under the laws
thereof."
The Reed dissent makes
the following comment on
this provision of the law:
"That declaration
springs from the Federal
character of the nation, It
recognizes the fact that the
maintenance of order and
fairness rests primarily
with the States."
