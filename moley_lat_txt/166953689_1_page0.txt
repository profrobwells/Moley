Republicans in Ohio are
confronted with a most
difficult choice in electing
a Senator this year.
On the one hand there
is the immensely popular
Governor, Frank Lausche.
In past years Lausche, be-
cause of his strong conserv-
ative philosophy and his in-
dependent attitude toward
the Democratic Party in
the State and in the na-
tion, has received a very
considerable proportion of
the Republican vote.
*
In 1950 when the Demo-
cratic nomination for Sen-
ator went to a palpably un-
qualified man and the polit-
ical arms of organized la-
bor poured money and ef-
fort to elect this man over
Taft, Lausche indicated his
feelings by refusing to sup-
port his party candidate.
Industrialists all over the
State, who are mostly Re-
publican, love Lausche be-
cause of his labor policies.
Republican affection, for
Lausche because of his
manifestations of sympathy
will be hard to overcome.
There is, as one Republi-
can put it, a matter of grat-
itude to be considered.
There is also a plain is-
sue of competence. Sen.
George Bender is an amia-
ble, energetic man who
came up on the rough road
of precinct and county poli-
tics. Until a few years ago
Republicans in Cleveland
who were also men of sub-
stance and power in busi-
ness did not regard Bender
seriously.
*
But during the Taft cam-
paign in 1950 and later in
the Taft effort for the Pres-
idential nomination these
businessmen came to real-
ize that the way to accom-
plish results was to work
with and not independent-
ly of the regular Republi-
can organization. That or-
ganization, such as it was,
had been held together
over the many lean years
by Bender.
Hence they decided to
work with Bender, who, to
be perfectly realistic, re-
sponded by greatly improv-
ing his political appeals
and methodology. In short,
Bender veered toward
statesmanship. Many of the
business leaders will con-
tribute a good deal of time
and money to the Bender
campaign for re-election to
the Senate.
One of the prize Bender
pieces of persuasion is a
brochure of letters from
the President and the 10
Cabinet members endors-
ing his candidacy.
Meanwhile, Lausche
goes his inimitable way,
giving offense to organiza-
tion Democrats from Na-
tional Chairman Butler
down. He is a genuine ad-
mirer of the President and
if elected with Eisen-
hower would no doubt sup-
port most of his policies in
the Senate.
It is just one vote that
is the rub—the vote for or-
ganizing the Senate. In
that determination,
Lausche's vote would go
to the Democrats, and con-
trol of the Senate in 1957
may hinge on one vote.
Perhaps the issue before
Republicans can be stated
simply as a choice between
man and party. It is impor-
tant, very important, to the
President to have a Repub-
lican Senate. All of the
chairmanships may well go
with the switch of one vote
in the coming election.
★
Bender's stature as a
statesman may leave some-
thing to be desired, but
his vote to organize the
Senate is as good as the
best. Also, in the many
tight votes in the future the
President's party may well
need regularity, and
Lausche, despite his ad-
miration for the President,
may well have his own
ideas on some Presidential
recommendations.
There is some worry
among Bender supporters
about newspaper support.
Publishers and editors are
not committed, but in the
past the press has been
substantially pro-Lausche.
It will be a difficult choice
for many newspapers.
Then there is the chance
that Lausche may not be
Bender's opponent after
all. A veteran Statehouse
correspondent who has
known Lausche for many
years feels that there is a
chance that in November
Lausche could be the
Democratic Vice-President-
ial candidate. But grant-
ing the desirability of
Lausche on the national
ticket, it is questionable
whether he would give up
his excellent prospect for
a Senate seat to run on a
ticket against Eisenhower.
