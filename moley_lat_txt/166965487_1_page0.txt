PROSPECTS FOR A GOP MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While several factors
preclude any guess at this
time as to the chance of a
Republican Senate in 1957,
the situation concerning
the House of Representatives is fairly clear. With
Eisenhower on the ticket
and fairly good candidates
in 30 or 40 key districts,
Minority Leader Martin
should be the next Speaker.
Most analysts place major
emphasis on what, on
the basis of the election returns of 1954, are called
"safe," "marginal," and
"critical" districts, Republican and Democratic.
★
In that sort of calculation
there are 94 "marginal" districts—63 Republican and
31 Democratic. These are
districts in which the margin of victory of the incumbent in 1954 was less
than 55% of the vote.
Included in those "marginal" districts are 23
"critical" districts—six
Democratic and 17 Republican. A "critical" district
is one in which the incumbent received less than
51.5% of the vote.
Thus a conclusion suggests itself that the Republicans face a more difficult
time than the Democrats,
because they have so many
more "marginal" and "critical" districts than do the
Democrats.
★
That, however, is not a
valid assumption, because
in 1954 the tide was rolling toward the Democrats
and several of the "marginal" and "critical" districts on the basis of 1952
returns were turned over.
That means that this year
with several advantages favoring the Republicans, including the presence of an
Eisenhower-Nixon ticket, it
will be much harder to capture a Republican "marginal" or "critical" seat
than a Democratic "marginal" or "critical" seat.
Thus it should be much
easier for the Republicans
to capture one of the six
"critical" Democratic seats
than it would be for the
Democrats to capture one
of the 17 "critical" Republican seats.
A better means of prognosis is to consider the
seats which switched in
1954. There were 25 such
seats—five from Democratic
to Republican, and 20 from
Republican to Democratic.
It would seem that at
least four of the five seats
captured by the Republicans from the Democrats in
1954 can be held. These are
the 1st Florida, the 1st Kansas, the 15th Ohio and the
5th Texas.
Among the 20 seats lost
by the Republicans to the
Democrats are at least four
which contain a large number of coal miners. They
were seriously depressed in
1954. The coal business is
considerably better now.
There were also 11 districts in which the political
agencies of labor were
strong—some in which the
CIO-PAC put forth heroic
efforts. The question in
those districts is whether
the CIO-PAC will be stronger or weaker than in 1954.
Judging by certain polls, a
larger proportion of the
votes of the rank and file
of labor will go Republican
this year than in 1954 or
even in 1952.
★
There is also the Negro
vote to be considered. If,
as some evidence indicates,
this vote will appreciably
slip away from a Democratic candidate, the effect in at
least eight or nine districts
will be bad for the Democratic candidates.
The most important factor will be the presence of
the President on the ticket.
Excluding the eccentric
and unpredictable 9th Minnesota, and the 12th California where a Democrat took
over a previously untested seat with 53.8% of
the vote, the average Republican drop in 1954 was
about 5%. Presumably a
large part of this was due
to the absence of the Eisenhower coattails.
★
Those coattails will be
available again this year. If
they help as much as they
did in 1952, most of the
seats lost in 1954 will be regained, together with a few
more. And only 15 switches
net will be needed to turn
Speaker Rayburn into a minority leader.
