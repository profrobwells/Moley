MARRIAGE
AND LOVE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

When, last December, the
AFL and CIO were joined
after years of differences,
Tom Murphy of the Masons
and Plasterers made a
touching speech about the
"marriage." In presenting
rings to George Meany and
Walter Reuther, Murphy
said:
"It is two clasped hands,
significant of the clasped
hands you see on the poster.
The hands join in one great
federation that we have
seen married and born this
week in this hall."
Hibernian exaggeration
may be forgiven for the
concept of birth and marriage
in one week. But what
people are beginning to ask,
six months after the
"marriage," is the extent
to which political compatibility
reigns in the household of
labor.
*
Some doubt is expressed
whether, despite the zealous
partisanship of Walter
Reuther, the joint organization
will support any Presidential
candidate. George Meany
leans toward the Democratic
side, but such potentates as
Dave Beck of the Teamsters
Union, Maurice A. Hutcheson
of the Carpenters and James
C. Petrillo of the Musicians
are for Eisenhower. In the
"plague on both your houses"
camp, John L. Lewis may
well permit his native
Republicanism to have its
innings this year.
Nevertheless, there will
be a convention in September
to determine whether there
will be an official endorsement
of a candidate and, if it is
decided to make a declaration,
which candidate will be
approved. Since it is hardly
likely that Reuther would
permit an endorsement of a
Republican candidate, the
issue would be either no
endorsement or a backing of
the Democratic nominee.
*
However, it has already
been decided that the AFL-
CIO will print and send to
15,000,000 members a political
"blacklist," which in more
polite terms is a pamphlet
of information concerning
members of Congress who
have not, in the opinion of
labor bosses, been favorable
to the interests of the unions.
It was explained by James
McDevitt, cochairman with
Jack Kroll of the CIO-PAC,
that the cost of this "blacklist"
need not come from voluntary
contributions by union members
because these pamphlets would
not be political exhortations.
Perhaps they call that sort of
thing education.
In the field of political
policy and issues there were
bound to be difficulties over
international relations. Meany
was distressed at Reuther's
comments in India. He declared
that Reuther was not speaking
for the AFL-CIO at that time.
There was also friction concerning
the international trade union
activities in which Jay Lovestone
has been operating. This,
however, was compromised
apparently to the satisfaction
of all concerned.
*
In the field of domestic
policies the differences are
matters of degree and of
emphasis. The legislative
programs of the two organizations
have been similar to each
other and to those of the ADA
and other "liberal" groups. In
the case of the AFL, however,
adherence to these ideas is
largely lip service. In the case
of the CIO there is real crusading
energy. How the differences
that will arise on specifics will
be compromised remains to be
seen,
