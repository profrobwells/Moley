SAM'S TOO SMART FOR TRAPS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While Sam Rayburn
lacks the philosophic depth
and quaintness that dis-
tinguished his long-time
colleague from Dallas, Hat-
ton Sumners, the Speaker
understands the traditions
of the house over which he
presides. Consequently, he
declined membership on a
"broadly based" committee
on Congressional policy
proposed by the Demo-
cratic National Commit-
tee's executive committee
last month.
In declining member-
ship for himself, Leader
McCormack, Whip Albert,
and Congressional Cam-
paign Committee Chair-
man Kirwan, the Speaker
said:
★
"In the House of Repre-
sentatives we have 233
Democratic members. I
fear if we took a position
on an outside committee a
great majority of these
Democratic members would
feel we were consulting
with somebody else than
the Democratic member-
ship of the House. The lead-
ership of the House con-
sults constantly among
themselves and with the
chairmen of all the commit-
tees with reference to legis-
lative programs. It is the
considered opinion of the
four of us that it would be
a mistake for the Demo-
cratic leadership of the
House to join in any pro-
gram that would place us
to work with any commit-
tee outside of the House
of Representatives."
This somewhat compli-
cated statement means that
the House of Representa-
tives is a co-ordinate body
that cannot be identified
with any party organiza-
tion which will lessen its
responsibility for its own
actions.
There may be an imme-
diate reason for this posi-
tion of Rayburn and his
fellow officers other than
the traditional independ-
ence of the House. After
the election, Rayburn and
Senate Majority Leader
Johnson announced that
they would have no specif-
ic Democratic program this
year.
Following that there was
a declaration of a group of
northern "liberal" Senators
that they would press for
civil rights and other legis-
lation. The Rayburn-John-
son leadership above all
wants no new war within
the party on that or any
other issue. Hence the dis-
inclination of Rayburn to
get into a position in which
he might be bound by the
action of a committee of the
national committee on
which he would surely be
outvoted.
But the position he takes
is in line with the long tra-
ditions and customs of Con-
gress. There are, in fact,
three Democratic Parties.
One is represented by the
national committee; the
others by the party cau-
cuses of the two houses.
The Democratic Nation-
al Committee and the con-
vention it calls are respon-
sible for the nomination
of the Presidential and
Vice-Presidential candi-
dates and with their efforts
to get themselves elected.
The national committee is
extremely parsimonious in
giving money toward the
election of members of
Congress. In one campaign
the total amount was $15,-
000.
★
In pursuing this tradi-
tion the Democrats in the
House will be much more
united this year than their
fellow partisans in the
Senate, for in the Senate
there are relatively more
"liberals" like Humphrey,
Douglas, Morse, and Mur-
ray who will be the spear-
head of the attack upon
the conservatives of the
South in the years to come.
So far as Democratic
conservatism is concerned,
its home will be in the
House. And, despite his oc-
casional tributes to
"liberalism," the honorable
Speaker must mind his
step lest he have a con-
servative revolt in his own
household.
