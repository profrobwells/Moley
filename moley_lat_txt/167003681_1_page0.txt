No useful purpose, even
for the Republican Party,
can be served by ignoring
the reality of a scare of
almost panic proportions
among Republican leaders
in Washington. This has
been in evidence for two
weeks.
A deadly stream of bad
news has appeared in the
public prints. The Maine
election was one shocker.
The drastic drop of 600,000
in the Republican reg-
istration in Pennsylvania
was another. The popu-
larity contest in the State
of Washington, with Gov.
Langlie running far behind
Sen. Magnuson, was an-
other.

Then there have been
polls of more or less sig-
nificance-mostly less, but
nevertheless alarming. It
seems that the party prin-
ciples of many farmers
fluctuate with the prices
of hogs-no pretty compli-
ment to the sturdy and
firm-principled yeomen of
the nation. Altogether the
picture is not a happy one.
This panic manifests it-
self in hurling the Presi-
dent into the front line.
New and arduous trips are
scheduled for him. A man
who only 12 short months
ago was lying with his life
fluttering before the yawn-
ing chasm of death is now
expected to take to the
road with a schedule which
would appall a Nixon or a
Kefauver.
Gone are the resolutions
to conduct a high-level
campaign. The happy fab-rications of Madison Ave-
nue advertising juggernauts
which were used to idle
away the pleasant days in
San Francisco now seem
far away and as unreal as
they actually were all the
time. Even the complacent
businessmen, who have
been happily counting
their profits while indulg-
ing in the fond belief that
one man and only one man
had created a blissful des-
tiny for them, are getting
a bit uneasy. It may take
them a while-perhaps a
fatal, all-too-lengthy while
-to do something, but
they are going to awake,
perhaps too late.
It is a panic that always
brings out the something
innate that may have
caused the panic. In a
storm pious men pray.
Weak men weep. And we
have all heard the ripe old
joke of the deacon who in
the moments before a
wreck took up a collection.

And so the White House
coterie headed by Sherman
Adams can think of noth-
ing but recourse to the
magic of the President's
personal appeal.
But the hard fact is that
it is this very reliance up-
on the President as a popu-
lar public figure that is at
the roots of the present
disastrous outlook.
For well over four years
the American people have
been subjected to propa-
ganda to the effect that the
Republican Party is a hap-
less rider on the Eisen-hower coattails. For years
there has been talk of re-
making the Republican
Party. As one reporter put
it in a Presidential press
conference, the President
married the Republican
Party to reform it.
With the use of slanted
and strange compilations
of the roll calls it has been
claimed that the Presi-
dent's real supporters in
Congress have been Demo-
crats, not Republicans.
Loyal Republicans have
been contemptuously re-
ferred to as old guards-
men, reactionaries-dead
branches fit for burning.

Commentators who be-
lieve that the President is
no Republican at all have
tirelessly repeated the un-
truth that the President
was elected by Democrats
and "something" that they
call "independents," while
the fact is that the people
who provided the Eisen-
hower-Nixon ticket with
its huge majority over the
1948 Dewey vote were peo-
ple who had not been vot-
ing at all.
And so the harvest of
this sort of thing is a con-
dition of apathy and de-
generation of the Republi-
can organization that not
only may retain the Demo-
cratic control of Congress
but might well sweep the
Eisenhower-Nixon ticket
itself down to defeat. And
the White House guard
has no answer except to
thrust the President for-
ward to rally the troops
who have been forgotten
over these years.
