The President's Plan
on the Middle East
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is quite understandable that both members of
Congress and editorialists
should have been cautious
about commenting on the
President's extraordinary
request for a free hand in
the Middle East. In the
first place the President
has just been re-elected by
an overwhelming vote. This
gives him a mandate of almost
unprecedented proportions.
Syria are willing to make
trouble on their own?
Control of the oil producing
areas of this region is
certainly not in the interest
of the Soviet since
it is already exporting oil.
It must also be considered
in appraising the
plan that while the oil of
the Middle East is essential
to Western Europe the
money that is paid for that
oil is essential to the Arabs.
It would seem that Arab
nations are less in need of
monetary assistance than
of a bit of education as to
what their monetary resources
can get for them.
Finally, it is to be hoped
that in the debate and
hearings that will now be
in order a new and understandable
policy may be
developed. So far we have
merely moved from crisis
to crisis.
Second, he has in the
past carried his responsibilities
so humbly and has
been so devoted to the constitutional
system of which
he is a part that almost
any power that might be
given him would, in the
light of that past, be used
with the utmost care and
with respect for the rights
of Congress.

Hence the generally cautious
comment by members
of both parties that the
President's request is
worthy of sympathetic
study â€” even of lengthy
study.
It is definitely an affirmative
policy. It proposes to
shore up defenses against
Communist penetration of
a region vital to the security
of most of the western
world. It puts the Kremlin
definitely on notice that we
mean business if there is a
thrust into that vital area.
The most interesting
aspect of the comment so
far is that there has been
so little mention of the constitutional
limitations imposed
upon the President
in his role as Commander
in Chief in peacetime. For
to give him this authority
to use armed force in a foreign
land without specific
authorization of Congress
would be to stretch the Constitution
to its very limits.
And even if this authority
should be exercised after
Congress has registered its
consent the delegation of
power would be almost
without precedent.

The President's specifications
in his speech and
the wording of the resolution
proposed to implement
the grant are in real
need of explanation. There
is no clear definition of
what is encompassed by
the "Middle East," there
is lack of specification concerning
the nature of the
aggression which should be
resisted by our armed force,
the promise to keep Congress
informed day by day
is not a recognition of the
co-ordinate power of Congress,
and the funds requested
are very large.
The unsteady but conniving
hand of the State
Department's bureaucracy
was seen in the early leakage
of the projected plan
to a few favored outlets.
This has had no beneficial
effect since it permitted
wide speculation as to what
was actually going to be
asked and also because it
has undoubtedly offended
Democrats in Congress who
will be expected to fall in
line in true bipartisanship.
In the exploration of the
plan by committees of
Congress several important
factors must be considered.
Is the real danger
in the Arab nations overt
military aggression rather
than subversion within? Indeed,
is the real danger to
the delicate balance in that
region external in nature?
Why should Russia step in
