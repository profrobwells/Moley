CAMPAIGN
FUNDS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In July, 1955, the Department
of Justice obtained
an indictment by a Federal
grand jury in Michigan,
charging the United Automobile
Workers with four
violations of the Federal
Corrupt Practices Act
which involved expenditures
made during the
1954 campaign. These expenditures,
which were
made in behalf of the union's
campaign to defeat
Sen. Ferguson and several
Congressmen in Michigan,
were for television broadcasts
in support of union-
endorsed candidates.
The law upon which the
indictment was based is
Section 610 of the Corrupt
Practices Act, which was
revised by the Taft-Hartley
legislation. It states
that:
*
"It is unlawful for
any corporation whatever,
or any labor organization
to make a contribution or
expenditure in connection
with any election at which
(several Federal officers
mentioned) . . . are voted
for."
Thus a prohibition which
has applied for a long time
to corporations was applied
to labor organizations.
The UAW entered a
plea of not guilty and
moved the dismissal of
the indictment on two
grounds: that the expenditures
in question were
not prohibited by the law,
and also that the act itself
was unconstitutional.
Federal District Judge
Frank A. Picard, who was
appointed by President
Roosevelt in 1939, dismissed
the indictment on
the first of these two
grounds. In doing so he
said, among other things:
"According to the authorities
the union was not
making an expenditure on
behalf of a political candidate.
It desired to inform
its members and others of
the position of the union
on those seeking certain
Federal offices. It was exercising
the right to free
speech. The question then
might present itself as to
whether or not what the
union did was in fact 'making
a contribution.' This
might be important if the
union were charged with
'making a contribution.' It
is not. It was so charged
in United States vs. Construction
& General Lab.
L. U. No. 264 supra, on
very similar facts, but still
the court held that its acts
did not encompass either a
'contribution' or 'expenditure.'
Our decision is
that under the authorities
the 'expenditures' charged
in this indictment are not
expenditures prohibited by
the act."
It is very important to
note that under this interpretation
of the law a corporation
might also do the
things which the UAW did
without violating the law.
Obviously the UAW and all
politically active unions
would cry out to the high
heavens if a corporation
should do so. Hence, the
entire question of what
constitutes "contributions"
and "expenditures" is undetermined.
The case is
now scheduled to come before
the Supreme Court.
*
If the Supreme Court
avoids the constitutional
issues the way will be open
for corporations (and probably
trade associations as
well) to buy time on the
air and space in the press;
and to issue at their expense
propaganda material
supporting candidates for
election to Federal offices.
In that case the issue will
probably go to Congress.
For the forces of the unions
will never be content to
permit corporations to engage
in such activities.
They will not only seek
new legislation specifically
discriminating between
corporations and the
unions but they will bring
stockholders' suits in any
corporations which participate
in such activities.
If, as is more likely, the
Supreme Court declare
that the law cited above is
unconstitutional because it
denies the right of free
speech, the slate will be
clean. That will mean that
Congress will have to start
all over again. And when
that issue is reached, the
most difficult of all questions
must be answered.
What is really political activity?
And who should be
permitted to engage in political
activity or to give
money for that purpose?
