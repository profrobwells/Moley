UNIONS IN
• POLITICS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The decision of Judge
Picard in the Eastern Dis-
trict of Michigan last Feb-
ruary in the suit brought
by the Department of Jus-
tice against the United
Automobile Workers has
been brought by appeal to
the Supreme Court.
The opinion there will
have a profound bearing
upon the political activities
of business corporations as
well as labor unions. For
under the Picard decision,
as well as other judgments
in similar cases, the ques-
tion is raised whether, if
unions are to be permitted
to make political expendi-
tures out of union funds,
the same privilege must be
accorded to corporations.
The law involved, which
is a Taft-Hartley amend-
ment to the Federal Cor-
rupt Practices Act, is not
clear, and presumably if
the Supreme Court follows
the Picard line the issue
will be an important item
in the new Congress.

As things stand, an excel-
lent legal opinion by a dis-
tinguished lawyer which
was presented to the Gore
subcommittee considering
election activities states
that a corporation may
spend its funds for:
"1—Salaries and wages
of its officers and regular
employees while engaged
in political activities, in the
interest of the corporation,
including support of a can-
didate for nomination or
election to a Federal office.
"2—Publication in any
house organ or other
printed document circu-
lated at the expense of the
corporation of opinion and
arguments of a political na-
ture, expressed as those of
the corporation.
"3—Purchase of radio or
television time or newspa-
per space for the presenta-
tion of political views, as
those of the corporation.
"4—In short, any means
of publicly or privately ex-
pressing the political views
of the corporate manage-
ment.
*
"5—In furtherance of any
nonpartisan effort to per-
suade voters to register and
vote, or to disseminate in-
formation and opinions
concerning public issues,
without regard to political
parties or candidates."
This lawyer makes it
clear in his opinion that he
is considering only what is
legal or illegal under the
Federal Corrupt Practices
Act. He is not considering
the hearing on this issue of
"Federal or local tax con-
sequences" or "legality in
the sense of immunity from
the consequences of dis-
senting stockholders'
suits."
The problem seems to re-
volve around the legal dis-
tinction between "expend-
itures" and "contributions."
As I understand it, and
I am subject to correction,
there is a serious difference
between a union's spending
its money in activities con-
ducted by itself Independ-
ently of a party organiza-
tion or candidate and a
straight campaign gift to
a party or candidate.
The constitutional ques-
tion arises from a challenge
that Congress was exceed-
ing its power in attempting
to prohibit a labor union
from spending its funds for
political purposes, even
though it does not con-
tribute money to be used
by others.

Under the original terms
of the Federal Corrupt
Practices Act a corporation
was prohibited from con-
tributing to or in connec-
tion with an election at
which Presidential electors,
Senators and Representa-
tives are to be voted for,
or to any candidate or po-
litical committee. The Taft-
Hartley enactment merely
extended this prohibition to
labor unions.
If both corporations and
unions are to be permitted
to carry on, as the UAW
has been conducting itself,
we shall see some interest-
ing questions raised in Con-
gress. Perhaps while those
questions are under con-
sideration by Congress it
would be well to get a clear
definition of what "politi-
cal" activities are. At the
present time unions are
masking much of what
they do along political lines
under the fair name of "ed-
ucation."
