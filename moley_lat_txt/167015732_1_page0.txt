Harnessing the Snake
River for the production
of electricity and other pur-
poses might seem academ-
ic to those Americans who
do not live in the North-
west.

But since they are tax-
payers the present con-
roversy over that subject
s very real indeed. For
the partnership policy of
the Eisenhower adminis-
ration which would unload
a considerable part of the
building of hydroelectric
plants on private investors
rather than taxpayers is
now about to meet its
greatest test.

Wayne Morse, Warren
Magnuson and other zeal-
ous advocates of Federally
socialized power interpret
their victories at the polls
last November as a repu-
diation of the President's
power policies. The center
of their attack will be what
is done about the Snake
River, which flows through
a deep canyon most of the
way between Idaho and
Oregon and then moves
into the State of Washing-
ton where it joins with the
Columbia River.

A bit. of geographical
description is essential to
an understanding of the
problem. Along the lower
reaches of the Snake in
Washington are four sites
for which Federal dams
are already authorized or
under construction by the
Army Engineers. They are
called Ice Harbor, Lower
Monumental, Little Goose
and Lower Granite.

Above these in the can-
yon that separates Idaho
and Oregon are several
sites which have been un-
der consideration from
time to time. The most im-
portant of these in their
order from the Washing-
ton boundary, going up
stream, are Nez Perce,
Mountain Sheep, Pleasant
Valley and Hells Canyon.

At the Hells Canyon
site the Federal Power
Commission after a long
hearing decided in 1955 to
permit the Idaho Power
Co. to build three dams
instead of a higher Feder-
al dam. Some years ago
there was under considera-
tion a Federal dam at
Mountain Sheep, but engi-
neers found a weakness in
the canyon walls which
made it impossible as a
site for a high structure.

During the last year four
of the private utilities in
the region have joined in
an application to the Fed-
eral Power Commission to
build two dams, at Pleas-
ant Valley and Mountain
Sheep. This has been bit-
terly opposed by the Na-
tional Hells Canyon Asso-
ciation, which also opposed
the Idaho Power Co.'s ap-
plication for the dams at
Hells Canyon. This associ-
ation is largely supported
financially by a number of
labor organizations, nota-
bly the United Automobile
Workers and the two big
garment workers' unions.

It was assumed all along
that the people opposing
the application of the pri-
vate companies favored a
high Federal dam at Pleas-
ant Valley which, if built,
would inundate the lower
of the three sites granted
the Idaho Power Co. In-
deed, it has appeared that
the Federal Bureau of Rec-
lamation has such a plan
in mind and that Secretary
Seaton knows all about it.

But suddenly in late No-
vember the attorney for the
Hells Canyon Association,
a Mrs. Evelyn Cooper, who
worked in the Interior De-
partment under the Tru-
man administration, shift-
ed the strategy and came
out against a dam at Pleas-
ant Valley built "by any-
body."

Also at about the same
time Sen. Morse proposed
that the Idaho power proj-
ect should be scrapped and
that a high Federal dam be
built at Hells Canyon. Also
that the Nez Perce site be
"reserved" for five years.

"The reason for this delay,
Morse explained, would be
to find a way to permit
salmon to get up the rivers
for breeding. Since the Con-
gress has repeatedly re-
fused to build a high dam at
Hells Canyon and the delay
at Nez Perce would be in-
determinate, this strategy is
clearly a means of stalling
any construction at all, pre-
sumably in the hope that
the Federal administration
will scrap its partnership
policy and agree to a high
Federal dam at Pleasant
Valley.

In this situation it ought
to be made clear by the
President and Secretary
Seaton exactly where the
administration stands. Is it
going to maintain the part-
nership policy or not? The
taxpayers of the nation
have a deep interest in this
because a compromise
would mean a Federal ex-
penditure of hundreds of
millions of dollars.
