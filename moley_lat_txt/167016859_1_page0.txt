ELASTIC SCHOOL STATISTICS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In Adlai Stevenson's
policy document on his
"New America" school pro-
gram he says that the Fed-
eral government can pro-
vide "more information
about hoof-and-mouth dis-
ease" than education.
Perhaps that is because
there is more "hoof-and-
mouth" information about
education than adequate
nonpolitical propaganda.
Indeed, the Democratic
candidate seems to be
spreading a good deal of
that sort of thing himself,
and if he will examine the
record personally he will
find that the Truman ad-
ministration acting under a
mandate of the Democratic
81st Congress was guilty of
a most flagrant misrepre-
sentation of school needs.
★
The dilemma of the Ei-
senhower administration,
however, is that it cannot
point out that fact because
it was the victim of that
misrepresentation.
A report, the full name
of which was "Report of
the Status Phase of the
School Facilities Survey,"
was authorized by an act
passed by the 81st Congress
and was financed by an ap-
propriation of $3,000,000,
which was matched by the
States.
The report itself was fi-
nally issued by the U.S.
Office of Education in De-
cember, 1953.
On the basis of that re-
port President Eisenhower
was misled into saying, in
his message of Feb. 5,
1955, that there was an ac-
cumulated deficit of 300,000
classrooms and, in addition,
a need for 50,000 more to
keep up with the growing
population.
The figure that finally
got into the program pro-
posed by President Eisen-
hower was 407,000, with a
cost of $7,000,000,000 to be
met by Federal, State and
local taxpayers. These fig-
ures had been supplied by
Oveta Culp Hobby, then
Secretary of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare, and
U.S. Commissioner of Edu-
cation Samuel M. Brownell.
★
There was a great build-
up for this program, but
presently the voice of in-
formed skepticism was
heard. After a survey by a
number of taxpayers'
groups, Steve Stahl of the
Oklahoma Public Expendi-
tures Council called the
survey upon which the
President's figures were
based "one of the greatest
frauds of the century."
Belatedly Mrs. Hobby ap-
peared on March 29, 1955,
before the House Commit-
tee on Education and La-
bor and admitted gross
error in the earlier figure.
Her department had found,
after a resurvey, that "the
estimated classroom defi-
cit by the year 1959-60
would be 176,000 class-
rooms rather than 407,000
classrooms."
It appeared later that the
"survey" conducted under
the Truman administration
was not really conducted
by the U.S. Office of Educa-
tion at all, but that the U.S.
Office of Education had
only compiled and pub-
lished reports coming from
the States.
In short, a bequest from
the Truman administra-
tion was a report which had
uncritically taken from
States what they said they
wanted, rather than what
they were able to demon-
strate as needed. It was in a
welter of scrambled statis-
tics that the whole program
came before Congress in
the final session of the 84th
Congress and was buried
by votes impelled not so
much on the basis of dem-
onstrated need but the vital
problem of segregation.
And now comes Candi-
date Stevenson with the
same discredited Truman
figures in a new dress. He
says that his figures come
from a Congressional sur-
vey of 1952 which, so far as
anyone is able to make out,
is the same old "phase sur-
vey" which fooled the Ei-
senhower administration.
★
Thus the Eisenhower ad-
ministration is unable to
make a really crushing an-
swer to the Stevenson as-
sault because it was itself
fooled by the phony figures
gathered under the Tru-
man administration.
The truth is that no one
knows what the needs are
and whether there are gen-
uine needs at all that re-
quire Federal action. The
whole present hullabaloo is
a mad scramble for votes.
