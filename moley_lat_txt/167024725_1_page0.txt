A WELFARE
EXPRESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The mad rush of Con-
gressmen to introduce bills
for all sorts of benefits for
all sorts of people shows
how dangerously we are ap-
proaching the rounded wel-
fare state.
This trend is a grim re-
minder of the warning giv-
en to Americans by Alexis
de Tocqueville a century
and a quarter ago. He said
that the greatest danger
threatening Americans
would not come from for-
eign enemies but from the
rise of a caretaker state. In
that land of oozy obsoles-
cence citizens would be
"timid animals" with gov-
ernment as the ever-pres-
ent "shepherd."
Now, since through the
spending of profligate gov-
ernment the savings of our
elder citizens have been
stolen by inflation, Demo-
crats and Republicans alike
are in a race to get the
votes of the 14,000,000 who
have passed age 65.
â˜…
Reps. Don Magnuson of
the welfare State of Wash-
ington, and Edith Green,
elected in Portland, Or., by
the unions, have intro-
duced a bill to create a
bureau of older persons.
This would spend its efforts
and the money of taxpayers
for the purpose of prying
into the lives of the elderly
and imposing on them
plans of life designed by
the ADA, the COPE, and
other similar organizations.
But the administration
hastens to point out that
there is no need for such a
bureau. It has in operation
or in its plans lots of things
to make oldsters forget
their lost savings. The
President last spring cre-
ated a Federal Council on
Aging. This was not in-
tended to find ways of pre-
venting old age but to cre-
ate the illusion that getting
old doesn't matter.
It is also pointed out that
the Labor Department re-
cently created a new pro-
gram to help older women
to get employment. Hus-
bands will welcome such
efforts because the same La-
bor Department has aided
and encouraged more and
more labor legislation and
union contracts which have
made it harder and harder
for older men to keep their
jobs or to get jobs.
*
The Civil Service Com-
mission has taken steps to
break the age barrier in
hiring people for Federal
jobs. Thus, some of us are
assured that when all else
fails we can work for the
government. And at the
rate the bureaucracy has
grown, there will be plenty
of such employment.
The cream of the jest is
an assurance from the Fed-'
eral Housing and Home Fi-
nance Agency that it has
been working out plans to
make it easier for older peo-
ple to buy "modest, pleas-
ant homes." The only way
we have ever found to
make the buying of homes
easier has been to have
somebody put up part of
the money. That, we as-
sume, is the objective of
the FHHFA.
Also, the FHHFA is
busily designing homes for
the aged with, It is said,
nonskid floors, and handles
in the bathrooms to make
it easier and safer to get in
and out of the bathtubs,
etc. One might wish that
the government would be
more concerned with non-
shrinkable dollars. For with
their savings these oldsters
might provide their own
nonskid floors and bath-
room handles.

Let us consider what has
happened to the dollars
that men or women now
65 put into life insurance
or other forms of savings
in other years. The dollars
put aside when they were
35 are now worth 654
cents. Those they put away
when they were a lusty and
vigorous 47 are worth 54
cents. It is pretty certain
that after they got into the
high tax years of the 1940s
they could save nothing at
all. And what they put in-
to Social Security after its
adoption 20 years ago is
also shrunken.
These people are the vic-
tims of a cruel and despi-
cable hoax by politicians
who are still anxious to
snare their votes as long
as they can' totter to the
polls.
