ALTERNATIVE PLANS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his press conference
on Jan. 30 the President
said this concerning the
criticism of Secretary Dulles
and the administration's
Middle East doctrine:
"Now, all of these critics,
I notice this: they don't
bring out any particular
project. They just talk
about great blundering and
lack of leadership. I have
seen no proposals, no con-
structive proposals for
what should have been
done with the benefit of
hindsight. On the con-
trary, we just hear these
generalized attacks, which
I assure you are easy to
make."
If the President meant
by this the Democratic
criticism of the actions of
his administration in fac-
ing the crisis brought about
by the invasion of Egypt,
he is on sound ground. But
if he is saying that there
has been no alternative
proposed for his so-called
Eisenhower doctrine gov-
erning what will be done
in the future, he is not on
sound ground. For both
Dean Acheson and now
Sen. Mike Mansfield have
made suggestions more in
line with constitutional
principles and procedures
than his own.
*
As I indicated in one of
these articles nearly a
month ago, the purpose
which the President seeks
can be accomplished with-
out violating the Constitu-
tion and without giving
him a blank check for both
military action and eco-
nomic aid. My suggestion
was that Congress declare
it to be in the national in-
terest that there be no ag-
gression in the Middle East
and that in case there is
such aggression the mili-
tary force of the United
States will be used to stop
it.
But when such aggres-
sion threatens and Con-
gress is in session, the
President will seek permis-
sion of Congress before in-
volving our military forces
in hostilities.
I made the additional
suggestion that if such ag-
gression takes place or
is immediately threatened
when Congress is in recess,
the President would act. It
would also be important to
separate the grant for the
use of economic aid from
the rest of the authority.
*
Under the Mansfield res-
olution there is at least im-
plied a recognition of the
constitutional right of Con-
gress to authorize military
action. The language of
that part of the resolution
is:
"To this end, if the
President determines the
necessity thereof, the Unit-
ed States is prepared to
use armed forces to assist
any nation or group of na-
tions requesting assistance
against armed aggression
from any country con-
trolled by international
Communism."
In his speech Sen. Mans-
field said that this means
that "this country will not
stand idly by if there is
Communist aggression in
that area and that such ag-
gression if it comes will be
met within our constitu-
tional processes."
With respect to economic
aid the Mansfield resolu-
tion says:
"The President should
recommend to the Congress
an economic program of
specific nature, amount and
duration which in his
judgment will facilitate a
settlement of the Suez dis-
pute and the Arab-Israeli
conflict and otherwise pro-
mote stability in the Middle
East and the peaceful prog-
ress of the nations of that
region."
It would seem that this is
the sort of constructive al-
ternative that the Presi-
dent is asking for but
which he says has not been
offered.
