If by deliberate intent
some State should enact
legislation to disfranchise
a million voters a hue and
cry about tyranny and op-
pression would arise. But
the voting laws and regu-
lations over the country,
together with the incompe-
tence of election officials,
bar many millions from the
polls even in a Presidential
election like the last one.
The American Heritage
Foundation, which in 1952
and again in 1956 did hero-
ic service in urging Ameri-
cans to vote, estimates that
in the November election
6,000,000 were barred from
voting as they had moved
across the county or State
lines, and another 2,600,000
were traveling on election
day without having cast
absence ballots. There
were other hundreds of
thousands who were barred
because of difficulties of
registration; And countless
others were unable to vote
because of incompetent
election officials.

A man and his wife of
my acquaintance who have
always been keenly inter-
ested in politics tell of their
own experience. Both of
them registered and voted
from their residences in
New York. But no less than
eight of their immediate
relatives were unable to
cast votes for reasons
resulting only in part from
their own negligence.
I have a letter from a
reader which implores me
not to blame "all of us who
don't vote." She goes on to
say that she wrote two
months before election for
an absentee ballot and
since there was no reply
wrote in succession four
more letters. Finally on
election day a ballot was
delivered to her in a hotel
3000 miles away. She
marked it and secured from
the postman a promise that
it would be postmarked
within an hour. But she
still doubts whether her
vote was actually counted.
There are in fact five
States (Alabama, Louisi-
ana, Mississippi, Pennsyl-
vania and South Carolina)
which do not allow absen-
tee voting by civilians.
New Mexico allows no vot-
ing by mail at all, even for
soldiers. In many States
members of the armed forc-
es vote by absentee ballot
only with great difficulty.
Twenty-one States lack
laws which require employ-
ees to have time off to vote.
Registration difficulties
place an undue burden on
millions of voters. Only 10
States have full permanent
registration, while 34 have
some partial form of it.
New York, for example,
enacted a law as recently
as 1954 which permits
counties to adopt perma-
nent registration if they so
desire.

Only last week New York
City adopted the system,
after vigorous pressure by
the League of Women Vot-
ers.
Some of the arguments
against permanent registra-
tion reveal not so much the
legitimacy of the case
against it as the hostility of
the politicians who run the
election machinery against
any reduction of the num-
ber of jobs involved in an-
nual registration. In New
York City election inspec-
tors under the annual sys-
tem have six days' employ-
ment for registration.
Those six days would be
reduced to two under per-
manent registration. Those
four days mean a lot to the
district leaders. Indeed,
they seem to mean a lot
more than the millions of
hours that annual registra-
tion costs the voters of the
city.

Voting regulations for
the most part were estab-
lished many years ago
when the public was in-
censed at the scandalous
wholesale voting of the
quick as well as the dead
by political bosses. But
what was a reform then
has come to be a burden on
the conscientious as well as
a source of political spoils
for the machine.
Making voting easier will
not only lessen the burdens
on responsible people but
will contribute to better
politics and more enlight-
ened government.
