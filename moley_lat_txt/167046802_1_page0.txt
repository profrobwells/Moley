BUSINESS
RIVAL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A notable recommenda-
tion of the Hoover Commis-
sion was the elimination of
no less than a thousand
business activities in the
Department of Defense
alone. This recommenda-
tion backed up and gave
point to efforts which had
been made by Secretary of
Defense Wilson to elimi-
nate such activities and
agencies.
Alarmed by this move
for greater economy and ef-
ficiency and by the danger
of losing government ac-
tivities in their districts
and States, members of
Congress tacked an amend-
ment onto the 1955 appro-
priation bill for the Depart-
ment of Defense.
*
The amendment required
the department to get clear-
ance from the Appropria-
tion Committees of the two
houses before discontinu-
ing any agency or activity
in operation more than
three years. It was round-
ly denounced by President
Eisenhower as an unconsti-
tutional invasion of his
powers, but it stood and
greatly hindered the elimi-
nation of such activities.
Despite this delay, the
Director of the Budget has
recently reported continu-
ing progress. His memo-
randum to the President
states that during the past
three years 492 agencies
and activities have been
discontinued or eliminated,
of which 355 were in the
Defense Department alone.
The list of such activities
illustrates the absurd ex-
tent to which the govern-
ment over the years has
been in competition with
private business. Among
them were 83 office equip-
ment repair shops, 79 auto-
motive repair shops, 45 tree
and garden nurseries, 22
bakeries, 20 cobbler shops,
15 laundries, 11 cement
mixing plants and four cof-
fee roasting plants.
*
Among the 137 agencies
in nonmilitary departments
of the government were 76
bakeries, 21 ice manufac-
turing plants, 20 surgical
and orthopedic appliance
units and 15 ice cream
plants.
Budget Director Brun-
dage pointed out further
that there had been turned
back to the Treasury more
than 1 billion dollars from
the sale of these installa-
tions plus the liquidation of
a considerable number of
RFC agencies such as syn-
thetic rubber plants, the
Inland Waterways Corp.,
the PWA-built Bluebeard's
Castle in the Virgin Is-
lands, the Island Trading
Corp. of Guam, and many
others.
Mr. Brundage in his re-
port makes the very impor-
tant point that the mere
fact that a government-op-
erated business claims to
operate more cheaply than
private business is no valid
reason why it should be
kept. The policy adopted
was to determine in each
case whether the public in-
terest could be served by
adequate and available
competitive private agen-
cies even when the appar-
ent cost might be more.
*
Cost, he points out, may
be less, because a govern-
ment operation escapes tax-
es which would be paid by
a private agency. The dif-
ferential in such a case is
really charged up to the
taxpayer. Moreover, gov-
ernment accounts are, he
says, "not kept in the same
manner as private ac-
counts."
The decisive principle
upon which he says the ad-
ministration is based is that
the government has no
right to compete in a pri-
vate-enterprise economy.
The net of these elimina-
tions is that small business
is helped by providing a
new customer, the govern-
ment; that the facilities
turned over are added to
State and local tax rolls;
and that the government
can get on with its legiti-
mate services in the fields
of security, welfare, and
defense without cluttering
itself up with coffee roast-
ing, shoe repairing, and the
manufacture of ice cream.
This makes good sense.
