POLITICAL
DUES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

While the Senators on
the Gore committee to in-
vestigate political activi-
ties, lobbying and cam-
paign contributions were
probing for ideas that
might lead to the legisla-
tive prevention of corrupt
practices in political cam-
paigns, Mr. I. W. Abel, sec-
retary-treasurer of the
United Steelworkers of
America and of the admin-
istrative committee of the
United Steelworkers of
America Political Action
Committee, made two im-
portant admissions.

*

Mr. Abel frankly stated
that the United Steelwork-
ers believe they should be
permitted to use dues
money for all phases of
their political activity—not
only for acquainting their
membership and friends
with their point of view
but for direct contributions
to candidates as well—so
long as they are required
to make these activities
public. Mr. Abel said he
saw no reason why corpora-
tions, under the same com-
pulsion to report, should
not use their stockholders’
money to make contribu-
tions for political purposes.

In addition, Mr. Abel, un-
der questioning, agreed
that the United Steelwork-
ers’ so-called Educational
Fund is actually a purely
political fund, organized to
persuade the members to
vote as the majority wish.

*

It has been the conten-
tion of the AFL-CIO’s
COPE, with which the
United Steelworkers’ PAC
is affiliated, that the Educa-
tional Fund, made up prin-
cipally of union dues, is
used for political education
but not for the purpose of
telling the membership
how to vote.

Excerpts from the hear-
ing of Dec. 11, 1956, follow:

Mr. Abel: Quite frankly,
sir, we believe we should
be permitted to use or-
ganization funds, trade un-
ion funds, for all the
various phases of political
activity, whether it be in
acquainting our member-
ship and our friends with
the legislative programs
of the unions, whether it
be in the way of advertise-
ment, our own newspapers,
or other media of litera-
ture, or whether it be fi-
nancial contributions to
specific parties or candi-
dates.

*

We think we should be
permitted to do that so long
as we are required then to
make public our activities.

The Chairman: In that
connection would you sug-
gest also the repeal of the
law respecting corporations
and permitting corpora-
tions, banks and such in-
stitutions to contribute out
of stockholders’ money?

Mr. Abel: I would see no
harm in it so long as those
corporations do their work
out in the public eye, if
there is a complete and full
report of it.

The Chairman: If the
labor union can collect
dues and spend those dues
and it is permitted to un-
der law, to spend those
dues to elect candidates for
office or proposed candi-
dates for office, the same
principle should apply to
corporations?

Mr. Abel: That is right,
and I would have no ob-
jection to it, sir.

*

If, as is possible, the
point made by Mr. Abel is
confirmed by the Supreme
Court in its present review
of a decision of Judge Pic-
ard in the case involving
the UAW, an interesting
dilemma will be placed be-
fore Congress. Will it be
possible by any legislative
device to prevent corpora-
tions from spending stock-
holders’ money in politics
regardless of the wishes of
a minority of those stock-
holders, and at the same
time to permit union of-
ficials to spend money,
part of which is contribut-
ed as dues by a minority
which does not agree with
the choice of the union?

Perhaps Congress will
apply the same rule to
both and prohibit any
such misuse of other peo-
ple’s money. This would,
it seems to me, be the only
possible solution.
