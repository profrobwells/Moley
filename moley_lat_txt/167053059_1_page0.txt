RAYMOND MOLEY:
Passing the Buck
on Budget Cutting
The legislation that cre-
ated an executive budget
system in the Federal gov-
ernment was passed very
late in the Wilson adminis-
tration. It went into effect
under President Harding.
Before that, each of the
departments and agencies
submitted to the commit-
tees of Congress their esti-
mates of what they wanted.
There was no real co-ordi-
nation of those various es-
timates except that the
heads of departments
might have talked with the
President about them. It
was assumed that Congress
would do the co-ordinating,
cutting the total expendi-
tures to fit the expected
revenues.
For many years students
of government had urged
the adoption of an execu-
tive budget on the general
order of the British system,
in which the Chancellor of
the Exchequer on behalf
of the crown presents a co-
ordinated budget showing
income, taxes to secure
that income, and requested
expenditures.
*
Finally a budget system
was adopted here, and the
afore-mentioned students of
government hailed the re-
form as a great step to-
ward economy which
would curb the greed of the
bureaus and departments
and end the habit of Con-
gress to engage in logroll-
ing—a process in which
each member helped all
other members in order to
secure what his own selfish
constituents wanted.
Finally, announced the
reformers, there would be
a truly "national voice"—
a Wilsonian phrase—plac-
ing the national interest
above all other interests,
planning on a grand scale
for all, with overriding dis-
cipline over the various
bureaus and departments
as well as the selfish inter-
ests of individual members
of Congress.
That sort of planning
was actually done by the
first Director of the Budget,
Charles G. Dawes. That
very able and courageous
gentleman, with the firm
backing of the President,
proceeded to knock depart-
ment heads together, cut-
ting and slashing on a truly
heroic scale. And Dawes
had only about a dozen
helpers in his Budget Bu-
reau rather than the hun-
dreds there now.
Another great Director
of the Budget, Lewis D.
Douglas, did something
like that in the first year
of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
administration. It is inter-
esting to note that Dawes
and Douglas lasted only a
year each.
What President Eisen-
hower is saying now is
that he and his Budget Bu-
reau are unable to plan,
unable to knock heads to-
gether, and that he is sub-
mitting a miscellaneous
collection of departmental
estimates and requests
which he wants Congress
to co-ordinate and cut.
*
In his press conference
on Jan. 23 he said:
"In my instructions to
the Cabinet and heads of
all offices I have told them
that every place that there
is to save a dollar...any-
body that is examining
that seriously ought to find
some place where they
might save another dollar.
If they can, I think if Con-
gress can, its committees,
it is their duty to do it."
This somewhat confused
statement means, if it
means anything, that the
President told his depart-
ment heads to have a heart
for the taxpayer, that Con-
gress ought to correlate
the estimates, indeed that
it is the duty of Congress
and the department heads
to find ways to economize.
Therefore, he seems to say,
that is not really an execu-
tive budget but a vast col-
lection of estimates and it
is not his duty but that of
Congress to do the cutting.
In this distressing pic-
ture Budget Director Brun-
dage has also abdicated his
responsibility. He says that
there will be no reduction
in the future, that he has
tried to compromise with
the requests of the depart-
ments and that "I will wel-
come any cuts (Congress)
can make without weaken-
ing protection or necessary
services."
In short, we are back
where we were before
Dawes. We merely have a
lot of departmental esti-
mates. The only thing the
President has done has
been to bind these esti-
mates together in a big
green book.
