In a speech in New
York, Republican Chair-
man Alcorn took Republi-
can critics sharply to task.
This follows the pattern of
the days when Dewey and
Willkie were running for
President and in public
speeches were in the habit
of scolding their own party.
The result of that was the
absence of some millions of
Republican voters on elec-
tion days. The new chair-
man might well consider
that his opposition is the
Democratic, not the Repub-
lican, Party.
In the course of his
speech he told a story of a
substantial 1956 Republi-
can contributor who told
him that, because of the
President's budget, he was
going to give nothing this
year,
â˜…
Alcorn then told the un-
happy Republican, "The
last budget of President
Truman was 3 billion dol-
lars more than the one
asked for by President Ei-
senhower and I explained
that budgets during the
past several years have tak-
en from 20 to 21% of the
gross national product. I
explained that the 1958
budget amounts to only
16% of the gross national
product. When we were,
through talking, he made a
substantial contribution."
That, I take it, was a
very happy ending for the
chairman.
The story reminds me of
the stories that the late
President Roosevelt used
to tell about his conversa-
tions with people who came
to him with some matter of
disagreement. The stories
always were highlighted
with a fatherly sermon by
the President and always
ended with his saying that
his visitor said, "Goodness,
I never thought of that."
But Alcorn's visitor, if
he had money enough to
claim such ardent attention
from the chairman, must
surely have some elemen-
tary knowledge of econom-
ics. And he must have
been distressed at the
chairman's casual informa-
tion.
In the first place, anyone
with an elementary sense
of politics and economics
should know that the Tru-
man budget to which he re-
ferred was a sort of shadow
budget. It was the one
which, as outgoing Presi-
dent, he was required to
submit, but which would
immediately be supplanted
by another budget by the
incoming President. For
this reason President Tru-
man included everything
but the kitchen stove as
vote bait, leaving it to his
successor to make the nec-
essary cuts.
A proper comparison
should be with the Truman
budgets from 1946 to 1950,
which were peacetime
budgets and which, even
with due corrections for
the shrinking dollar, were
not bad by comparison with
those of the present Presi-
dent..
Excluding national de-
fense, veterans' services
and benefits, interest on the
public debt, and interna-
tional affairs and finance,
the Truman expenditures
in fiscal years 1947, 1948
and 1949 were approxi-
mately $5,700,000,000, $4,
600,000,000 and $8,100,000,-
000 respectively. The Eis-
enhower fiscal years 1954,
1955 and 1956 for the same
purposes were respectively
$8,100,000,000, $10,500,000,-
000 and $11,200,000,000.
The alibi which has been
offered over and over by
the administration about
percentages of the "gross
national product" is arrant
nonsense. In the first place,
the "national product,"
either gross or net, is not
a real product in the sense
that it is wealth produced.
It is a lot of things, includ-
ing expenditures.
"Gross" national product,
as given out by the De-
partment of Commerce, in-
cludes among many things,
not relevant to wealth pro-
duced, the spending of the
government. Thus the
more the government
spends, the bigger the
"gross national product."
The Department of Com-
merce has another, smaller
figure for "net national
product," but that, too, is
no guide to what the na-
tion can afford.
Finally, what reason is
there the government
should justify what it
spends on the basis of any
such figure as national
product or national income.
The justification of govern-
ment expenditures should
be on the basis of need for
each item. That, no doubt,
Chairman Alcorn has been
too busy with his regional
meetings to examine.
