A BALANCED BUDGET AND INFLATION
The promise by the
President of a balanced
budget for fiscal 1958 is
likely to delude Americans
into a belief that when the
government takes in more
than it spends there need
be no fear of inflation. A
bit of economic common
sense, however, will serve
to dissipate that fatal de-
lusion. For the budget is
inflationary, despite the
possibility that it will be
balanced.
Moreover, there are forc-
es, such as unwise wage
increases and large con-
sumption of materials for
public works, that are just
as likely to produce infla-
tion as the government
printing presses. And final-
ly, there is no assurance
that the 1958 budget will be
balanced at all.

An authority as eminent
as Prof. Arthur Burns, un-
til this year chairman
of the President's Council
of Economic Advisers,
said recently that the
President's budget, even if
balanced, is inflationary.
Perhaps this bit of frank-
ness reflects his feeling as
a private citizen after an
unsuccessful fight while in
the government to ward
off the spenders from the
President. For in past
years Burns and Treasury
Secretary Humphrey were
the two sanest of the White
House's financial advisers.
To the average Ameri-
can the word "balanced"
is comforting. It means in
private life, the thrifty hab-
it of making a little more
money than is spent. It
means something for sav-
ings against rainy days
ahead. Or it means paying
off debts.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
indicated in the Presi-
dent's budget has no such
comforting assurances,
When the President ad-
monished the unions and
employers alike to use self-
restraint in wage and price
increases, he was pointing
at one of the most certain
causes of inflation other
than the printing of paper
money. For a wave of
wage increases would in-
jure the national economy
and only partially benefit
the workers on the receiv-
ing end.
As Lemuel R. Boulware,
vice-president of General
Electric, said recently:
But such a balance as is "Money wages are the pay
you see. The real wages
are what the pay is worth."
For despite the arguments
of union economists, there
is no sufficient increase in
the product of labor to jus-
tify such increases of
wages and benefits as we
have seen in recent years.
Despite progress in tech-
nology, the actual increase
in productivity is only
about 3% a year in manu-
facturing and 2% in the
economy as a whole. And
the higher rate for manu-
facturing is justified by the
efficiency of a few of the
manufacturers.
Another reason why this
budget, although it may be
balanced, is inflationary is
the presence in it of vast
amounts of pork-barrel ex-
penditures. Even the Joint
Congressional Committee
on the Economic Report
has warned about large
spending on public works
at this time.
But the President was
indulging in what may
prove to be unwarranted
optimism when he said
there may be a surplus in
1958. This rosy expectation
was based upon an as-
sumption of a continuing
rise of business activity.
The unpopularity of the
spending plans of the ad-
ministration is in itself a
serious shock to the confi-
dence which has carried the
President through his first
four years. There is al-
ready a slowdown in for-
ward capital expenditures.
This slowdown will be
compounded because its
very existence induces
further restraints.

There is an ominous
note in many of the an-
nual statements of corpo-
rations. Volume is up, but
with little or no increases
in profits available for the
government's tax. This
may be the sort of "profit-
less prosperity" that we
heard about in the 1920s.
Even a slight drop in vol-
ume produces a larger rel-
ative drop in what a com-
pany pays in taxes because
of the steeply graduated
rates.
And when many compa-
nies have a break-even
point of 80 to 90%, it
would take no catastrophic
drop in sales volume to
wipe out a large part of
taxable income. In short,
we cannot support an ex-
travagant government out
of a profitless prosperity.
