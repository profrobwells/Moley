LABOR IN MICHIGAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

While the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education did well over the nation, swept the State of Oregon and won Senators in Pennsylvania and Colorado, its leaders in Michigan are not too happy about how things went there.
Reports from Detroit indicate that, while there is no doubt about Gov. Mennen Williams being Walter Reuther's man, it is also true that the size of the Governor's victory—286,000 over Detroit's Mayor Albert E. Cobo, 66.8% of the vote in Detroit, and 47.6% in the rest of the State—is to a considerable extent due to reasons personal to the young man himself.
Williams spends an inordinate amount of time Kefauvering over the State, shaking hands and acting folksy. More useful but less popular Governors serve the folks better at their desks, of course. But perhaps a Governor in the hand is worth two at his desk or, if you will, the hand is mightier than the pen.

It is further reported that Reuther had a large part in the nomination of Stevenson. He was reported to have done a lot of long-distance masterminding in Stevenson's campaign, but the Eisenhower margin of 355,000 is no tribute to the CIO leader's command of his own State.
In any event, at this writing Reuther is still vacationing somewhere and has been inaccessible to the press since the election.
The pre-election efforts of the CIO-UAW in Michigan were prodigious. It is reported that every member of the UAW staff was laboring in the Democratic machine. At least 3500 volunteer campaign workers, union staff members, were carrying on in the precincts.
It was reported by members of one of the locals that 42 workers were assigned at a regular meeting, and that the expense was to be borne by political contributions.
Ballot brigades were organized by the CIO and two AFL organizations in Wayne County. Their job was to distribute literature, transport union workers and families to the polls, and look after the babies while parents were doing their civic chores.
The CIO was very confident that the net gain of two House seats in 1954 would be increased by four this year. Instead, they lost one of the 1954 gains and failed to take over any Republican districts.
In the State Legislature the Republicans picked up two House seats to give them a 61-49 edge, and one in the Senate to make a Republican majority of 23 to 11.
However, there is a lot to be done before the grip of the CIO-controlled Democratic Party can be shaken. Republican State Chairman Feikens says that the Republican Party in the State needs "a revamping" which will provide a continuing campaign organization.
