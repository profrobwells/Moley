TRADE UNION FUNDS
AND POLITICS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The Supreme Court, in a
6-3 decision, has reinstated
an indictment of the United
Auto Workers for violation
of the Corrupt Practices
Act in using the general
funds of the union, col-
lected in dues from the
members, for certain tere-
casts in support of candi-
dates in the 1954 campaign.
These, it should be noted,
were addressed to the gen-
eral public. The issue
would be quite different,
according to Justice Frank-
furter's decision, if the ap-
peal for a candidate were
made in a union newspaper,
since such an appeal would
go to union members only.
This is a true Frankfur-
terian distinction without
a difference. The real point,
in morals or in law, is
whether money which a
union member contributes
for the purpose of support-
ing a bargaining agency
can be used for candidates
whom union heads have
decided to support.

Suppose, for example,
you are an automobile
worker who favors the
election of John Jones, a
Republican candidate for
Congress, and suppose the
boss of the union, Walter
Reuther, takes your money
to support, even in a labor
publication, Henry Smith, a
Democrat running against
Jones. You would have a
right to go to the courts
of the land under the law
and, it seems to me, under
the Constitution and claim
protection from the im-
proper use of your proper-
ty.

Indeed, this is the point
which was made when the
original law was passed by
Congress in 1907 prohibit-
ing political contributions
by corporations. That law
recognized that the officers
or directors of a corpora-
tion would violate stock-
holders' rights in using
company money in politics.
The Corrupt Practices Act,
revised by the Taft-Hartley
legislation, merely places
labor unions along with
corporations under the
same prohibition.

The issue involved is
very important, since the
unions claim that they can,
by the subterfuge of call-
ing their political appeals
by the name "education,"
use their general funds.
In the hearings before the
Gore Subcommittee on
Privileges and Elections of
the U.S. Senate last year
representatives of the
unions claimed that the
following activities were
educational, not political,
as quoted in the Gore re-
port:
"The representatives of
labor cited the following
examples of activity in
which they, and under
their constitutional right,
are permitted to engage
with the use of general
union funds: (1) system-
atically organized drives
for registration of voters;
(2) carry out a systematic
program of political edu-
cation, including organiza-
tion of schools where
political questions are dis-
cussed, and the compila-
tion and distribution of
voting records; and (3)
exercise the right of free
speech by expressing their
views on political ques-
tions in print and by means
of radio and television and
otherwise."
This covers nearly the
whole waterfront of poli-
tics, since not only the
general funds of the unions
but the time and energy of
union officers and shop
stewards are used in regis-
tering not all voters but
voters sympathetic with
the politics of the union
leaders. It should be noted
also that under (2) above,
the printing and distribu-
tion of voting records of
members of Congress in
the last campaign involved
15,000,000 pieces of "litera-
ture."
The issue that the Su-
preme Court cannot dodge
forever is whether, if
unions may carry on these
political activities under
the name "education" and
with general funds, the
same permission is not
granted to corporations.
The issue involved is the
same in both cases â€” i.e.,
whether an individual's
money can be used without
his consent for a political
purpose to which he is op-
posed. Such permission
should be denied to both
corporations and unions,
not only because of the
moral issue involved but
because the alternative
would result in utter chaos.
