Sen. Hubert Humphrey
is the ripened product of
two formative influences.
On the political side he is
the authentic heir of the
crackpot political move-
ments under which he was
born and grew to manhood
—namely, the Nonparti-
san League and the Farm-
er-Labor Party.
These in turn inherited
earlier inflationary and col-
lectivist manias, the Grang-
er movement and Popu-
lism. The more recent
influence is that congeries
of collectivists who find
their focal point in the
Americans for Democratic
Action, in which Hum-
phrey is a leading elder.
Since he is an incessant
talker and introducer of
bills, his Senatorial utter-
ances provide an excellent
pattern of the sort of civi-
lization in which we would
find ourselves should
Humphrey take over the
Democratic Party and the
Democratic Party the na-
tion.
*
I have space today to
consider only one of the
many Humphrey plans,
which is something he
calls "The Youth Opportu-
nity Program." At a later
date I shall have something
to say about his plan to
Socialize the fine arts — a
scheme which should
bring grunts of approval
from the tomb of Karl
Marx.
The Youth Opportunity
Program is in five parts.
Three have to do directly
with education but, as can
be legitimately inferred,
all five are designed to
fasten the hold of a col-
lectivist Federal bureauc-
racy upon the minds of
Americans.
His first bill parallels the
school-building program of
the President. The second
would provide Federal
money for the scholarships
in the amount of $40,000,-
000 for the first year, and
after that increasing by
the same amount year aft-
er year, presumably so
long as there are youths to
get the money. The third
would give parents a tax
credit up to $450 for what
they spend on the educa-
tion of their children. The
sum total of these benefits
would not only relieve a
very great many people
with children of a very
considerable part of their
Federal tax but would, as
the scholarship money
piled up at a rate of in-
crease of $40,000,000 a year,
take all worries off the
youth. Indeed, it would be
much more attractive for
youth to stay indefinitely
at school than to go to
work.
Beyond these three ed-
ucational giveaways are
two which really follow the
pattern of continental So-
cialism. The Senator's
fourth bill would set up in
the Federal government a
means of imposing upon
the States and local com-
munities programs for
decreasing juvenile delin-
quency.
★
Then it would provide
Federal handouts to the
States and local communi-
ties to put such programs
into effect. Since there are
48 States, but a great many
local units of government,
the cost of this would
mount enormously. Since
doing something about ju-
venile delinquency may
mean anything that any
specific social worker sug-
gests — from setting up
clubs and psychiatric clin-
ics, special courts and police
units, to diet kitchens and
libraries — there would be
little limit on the ability of
the Federal bureau giving
these handouts to get its
nose into almost every cor-
ner of community life.
Finally, in true conti-
nental style, the Senator
would establish youth
corps. These would be dis-
ciplined, semimilitary units
of boys between 16 and 19.
Presumably these youth
groups would work in the
woods and fields by day.
This prospect is nicely em-
bellished by one of the Sen-
ator's greatest oratorical
horrors.
*
They would work "where
God's finest product, the
youth, and the wonders of
nature can work together."
A lot of boys would have a
different view about that
environment. But at night
and on Sundays there
would undoubtedly be
what the Senator would
call "education," but what
would really be indoctrina-
tion. For no condition could
be conceived as more favor-
able for imprinting upon
a captive group ideological
patterns designed by a Fed-
eral bureaucracy.
But a final and most im-
portant point comes to
mind. How about a youth
opportunity program
which would cut Federal
spending so that the taxes
which this generation of
the young will have to pay
will not be an insuperable
obstacle in the way of its
business and professional
advancement?
