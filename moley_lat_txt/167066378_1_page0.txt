A SCHOOL
PLAN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When, later this month,
the Governors of the various
States at their annual
conference consider the
problems of a more efficient
use of the money spent on
education and thus make
Federal aid still more unnecessary, they might well
ponder the common sense
of a businessman who is
president of the School
Board of Canton, O. His
name is John Baker, and he
makes his living as chief
products engineer of the
Timken Roller Bearing Co.
of his home city.
He has approached the
problem of school efficiency
from the standpoint of
what American management
has learned about using its
capital investment to its
fullest extent. It is a matter
of fact that one of the reasons
for the pathetic decline of
England as an industrial
nation is the failure of its
industrial managers to use
their plants more hours in
the day. Some work only
one shift with tea breaks
and all the rest of the leisure
insisted upon by English
labor. A few work two shifts,
and almost none work three
shifts.
★
This waste prevails despite
the easily understood fact
that a $100,000 machine in
the United States becomes
only a $50,000 investment
when two shifts are worked,
and a $33,000 investment
when three shifts are worked.
Mr. Baker, with this industrial
experience in mind, made a
speech recently at a meeting
of the Ohio Association of
School Business Officials. It
packs more common sense
than all the rest of the current
debate on Federal school
construction.
Among a number of points
that Mr. Baker made—which,
if adopted would greatly
increase the benefits received
from our present school plant
and teaching staff—was a
suggestion of going on a
four-quarter plan, at least for
high schools.
In suggesting this, he recognizes
that most school administrators
will say that it has been tried
and has not worked out very
well. Nevertheless, the simplicity
of the plan makes it more and
more insistent that something
should be made of it before
the Federal taxpayer is called
upon to pay out billions for
school facilities that will be
used at a 75% rate of efficiency.
To illustrate his point Mr.
Baker offers Canton’s problem,
created by a great increase
in high school enrollment. He
says:
★
“We have this year a total
enrollment of 22,000 in approximate
numbers, of which 25% or
5500 are high school students.
Our high school capacity is
6000 in four schools, three of
which are filled and the fourth
will be filled within a few years.
“Two of the high schools
which need additional capacity
are so situated that any addition
would be impossible. A third
high school needs additional
capacity, also, and this is possible
but only at considerable expense.
The fourth high school, whose
capacity could be increased at
reasonable cost, does not need it.
“If we go to the four-quarter
operation of our high school
only, we increase their capacity
33⅓%, or from 6000 to 8000
students. That is an increase
of 2000 high school students
with no corresponding increase
in high school facilities. Right
there is a saving in capital expenditure
of over $4,000,000.
★
“What about operational and
fixed costs? Of our approximately
$300 per child-per-year costs,
about $260 represent operational
costs and $40 fixed charges.
Operational costs vary with the
number of students, but fixed
charges are dependent on the size
of the facilities. There could be
no saving in the $260 operational
cost, but with no increase in
school facilities we save $40 per
student, for each of the 2000
additional students, or $80,000
per year.
“Again please note that the
number of teachers need not be
increased.”
