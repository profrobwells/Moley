After the campaign four
years ago, I directed a bit
of research in certain Eng-
lish newspapers concerning
their reporting of the Ste-
venson - Eisenhower con-
test.
I found that the accounts
of the campaign in the Lon-
don Times and Manchester
Guardian were wretched
travesties on the truth.
(The U.S. correspondent of
the Manchester Guardian is
Alistair Cooke, a recently
naturalized American, who
also explains America to
Americans on a television
show called "Omnibus.")
They were not only
grossly biased in favor of
Stevenson, but egregiously
wrong in their facts and re-
plete with evidence of
sloppy, indifferent efforts
to provide coverage. I
found the accounts in the
less influential Daily Tele-
graph a refreshing con-
trast. They were fair and
factual.

At that time, I pointed
out that such reporting in
newspapers like the Times
and Guardian was bound to
have a malignant effect
upon the relations of the
two countries. For when
leaders of opinion in a na-
tion are given such doses of
prejudice and inaccuracy
day after day, not only pub-
lic opinion but official life
is sure to be affected.
The present clash in poli-
cy which is a mark of de-
teriorating friendship be-
tween the two countries
has turned me to an exam-
ination of those papers so
far as this year's campaign
is concerned. My space
here permits only a short
sample of what readers of
the influential and alleged-
ly authoritative London
Times is saying about our
campaign. But this sam-
ple will indicate that the
same sort of prejudice and
misrepresentation is still
present.
★
Let us look at the mat-
ter of prejudice first. In
two articles, "From Our
Washington Corre-
spondent," published on
Oct. 23 and 24, there is pur-
ported to be a summing up
of the campaign to date.
Mr. Stevenson is, as he was
four years ago, the perfect
gentle knight. "The essen-
tial integrity of his politi-
cal views" is mentioned.
After the "correspondent"
witnessed the two conven-
tions he concluded that "if
elections were won by good
taste and intelligent dis-
cernment it might then
have been Mr. Stevenson
all the way."
The President, on the
other hand, wears "The
Panglossian Mantle,"
which indicates to any
reader of Voltaire's "Can-
dide" that the "correspon-
dent" regards Mr. Eisen-
hower as a smiling fool.
To rub in the idea a bit
more, he is called "smug."
On the basis of opinions of
certain, unnamed "fellow
officers," the President is
called a "mediocrity" who
did well in the Army only
because he entered West
Point "four or five years"
older than his classmates.
★
The President hardly
needs an answer from me
on this point, but I might
point out the fact that
Dwight Eisenhower went
on after West Point and
over a period of many
years took, with brilliant
success, almost all of the
training courses available
to an Army officer. In the
American tradition this
might be regarded as a
reason for his success.
Nixon is made the ob-
ject of snide innuendo
constantly. In commenting
on the Republican "truth
squads," the "correspon-
dent" says that "few can
have missed the point of
having the President dis-
patch Mr. Nixon of all
people, with a solemn ex-
hortation to tell the truth."
The Republican Party is
a constant object of de-
rision and attack. The "cor-
respondent" speaks of the
"Taft-wing Old Guard
which still seems to domi-
nate the State and city
satraps." This will be news
to the people who dominate
the governments of New
York City, Chicago, Phila-
delphia and Jersey City.
★
Nothing but gross igno-
rance and sloppy reporting
can excuse a statement
that the Knowlands, Brick-
ers, Jenners and Dirksens
"were voting against the
President at almost every
turn in Congress." This is a
flat falsehood which even
the slightest inquiry might
have corrected. As I
pointed out in an article
in this newspaper two
weeks ago, Sen. Jenner
when the chips were down
was in opposition to the
President in the 83rd and
84th Congresses only 11.7%
of the time. The other Sen-
ators mentioned had even
better records of loyalty.
But the lack of respect
of this "correspondent" for
the truth leads him to de-
scribe in the Times of Oct.
27 the recent fabrications
of a certain American re-
porter in terms which
would lead the readers to
believe that the account of
the President's "relapse"
had elements of truth.
It is small wonder that
the British misunderstand
American affairs.
