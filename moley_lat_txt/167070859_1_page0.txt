NEW GOP
CHIEF
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The contrast in person-
alities beween Hugh Meade
Alcorn Jr., new Republi-
can national chairman,
and the man he has suc-
ceeded, Leonard Hall,
could scarcely be more
marked.
Hall is an extrovert-a
smiling, dynamic, roly-
poly mountain of affabili-
ty. His attention to detail
left something to be de-
sired - something, inci-
dentally, which-his subor-
dinates were constantly
laboring to supply.
Few could dislike Leon-
ard Hall. No one could
hate him. In some man-
ner he prevented any bad
rifts from breaking out in
the party of which he was
the commander. Even the
people who failed to get
the government jobs they
wanted were willing to at-
tribute the cause of their
disappointment to some-
body in the mysterious
White House palace guard
-a group which nas never
won the affection of the
public or of politicians.
In any instance like the
"Dump Nixon" rumpus'
Hall proved to be able to
take a strong stand, even
to the extent of carrying
the President along with
him. He leaves with a rec-
ord of success in keeping
sufficient unity in his party
to provide for the Presi-
dent a record-breaking ma-
jority.
*
Alcorn is a man more in-
clined to detail. A lawyer,
his reasoning power is
complicated, and the deci-
sions he arrives at are like-
ly to be more carefully
considered. His capacity
for organization is proba-
bly greater than that of
Hall. He has been hailed
as a "liberal" Republican
by people who may have
little conception of what
the term means.
He has really shown no
passionate concern about
the ideological differences
which would divide a Sen-
ator like Dirksen from a
leader like Thomas E.
Dewey. He would proba-
bly describe his philosophy
as Eisenhower Republi-
canism-a term which be-
comes more and more dif-
ficult to define as the Pres-
ident's concern for sound
money clashes with his in-
flationary spending plans.
The plain fact is ad-
mitted by Republicans in
Washington that no valid
prediction can be made as
to what success Alcorn
will have in his new job.
He has never handled any-
thing like this before. His
work as national commit-
teeman for Connecticut
was outstanding. Not only
was the State carried by
the President and Sen.
Bush-but all of its Con-
gressmen are now Repub-
lican. The capture of the
Hartford district was a
real achievement. Beyond
that and the competent
job he did in handling the
San Francisco convention
arrangements, there is no
way to measure the man's
ability.
The job he must under-
take is, however, as formi-
dable as ever faced a na-
tional chairman. Despite
the harmony promoted by
the mutual respect enter-
tained by the President
and the late Sen. Taft,
there are bitter enmities in
the Republican Party. The
world of Sen. Case of. New
Jersey is alien to that of
Sen. Jenner. The White
House circle, official and
unofficial, is doing little to
cement the party. Alcorn,
if successful, must keep
these differences from
breaking out.
*
Moreover, the Republi-
can Party in many States
is in sad disarray. Pennsyl-
vania is a glaring example.
In some places, like Ore-
gon, it is almost dead. The
labors of a very great and
energetic leader, are essen-
tial to this task of rebuild-
ing. Unless Alcorn can ac-
complish something in this
respect, the 1958 election
will be a bitter defeat for
the Republican Party..
Meanwhile, until Alcorn
proves himself, Republi-
cans must live on hope.
They have done that many
times in their history.
