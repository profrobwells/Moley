RAYMOND MOLEY:
Suggested Controls
for Federal Spending
In a previous article I
pointed out the alarming
lack of control by Congress
over Federal spending. We
owe 275 billion dollars,
which is as much as we are
worth in dollars.
We have obligated our-
selves to raise and pay, if
necessary, 250 billion dol-
lars more in "contingent
liabilities." At the moment
there is 70 to 80 billion
dollars in "unexpended bal-
ances," and on July 1 there
will be 140 billion dollars.
Over the latter, Congress
will have no further con-
trol as the law stands now.
If it were possible, the ex-
ecutive department would
have authority to spend all
of that and thus throw us
further into hopeless debt.
And there are also the
vast sums that are being
paid out of the many gov-
ernment trust funds.
The Senate has again
passed a revolutionary
piece of legislation de-
signed to meet the danger
â€”a reform recommended
by the Hoover Commission
and endorsed by the Presi-
dent, the Comptroller Gen-
eral, and the Secretary of
the Treasury.
*
The purpose of this bill
would be to permit Con-
gress to deal with all the
obligations of the Federal
government annually and
on a yearly basis. It would
supplant the present cum-
bersome "obligational au-
thority" system. And it
would call up for review
all the balances left over
from appropriations for
previous years.
Under this bill Congress
would appropriate funds
each year only for esti-
mated spending actually to
be undertaken or accrued
in a single specific year.
Since the expression in
the bill is to put appropria-
tions "on an annual ac-
crued expenditure basis,"
and since the word "ac-
crued" has always been
somewhat mysterious to
me, I have found a fairly
good explanation of the
proposed plan in the testi-
mony of Robert Keller, as-
sistant to the Comptroller
General.
"Under this method, ap-
propriations proposed by
the agencies would be
stated in terms of the
charges for goods and serv-
ices to be received during
the budget year, and pay-
ments otherwise author-
ized by law to be made dur-
ing that same year. In
other words, the amount of
each proposed appropria-
tion would represent the
estimated amount of fi-
nancing required for the
program of work to be con-
ducted during the budget
year.
"The proposed legisla-
tion provides that any ac-
crued expenditures
charged to the appropria-
tion for a fiscal year, but
not paid during such year,
shall be merged with a sim-
ilar appropriation for the
next year, to constitute a
single account for disburs-
ing purposes."
*
As I now understand it,
the reform would have the
effect of reducing, in a year
or so, the great threat to
fiscal soundness presented
by the "unexpended bal-
ances." These would be re-
duced greatly or wholly
eliminated. Fiscal control
would then be returned to
Congress, where the Con-
stitution intended it to be.
This reform would need
to be carried out faithfully
by the executive depart-
ment. That would call for
a Budget Director with
genuine authority from the
President and with enough
fortitude on his own ac-
count to keep the flood of
spending under control. In
short, the correction of the
defective practices now
prevalent would not be au-
tomatic. But there would
no longer be any alibi for a
President who might seek
to shirk his responsibility.
This corrective legisla-
tion was passed by the Sen-
ate last year and died in
the House. Its most serious
threat this year is present-
ed by those crusty old gen-
tlemen who are respective-
ly the ranking members,
Democratic and Republi-
can, in the House Appro-
priations Committee, Clar-
ence Cannon and John
Taber.
Their opposition seems to
lie not in any objection to
the purpose of the bill, but
in their feeling that out of
their past experience (34
years each) they have
things under control, and
the simple facts prove it.
