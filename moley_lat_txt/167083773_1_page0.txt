There are plenty of peo-
ple, in and out of Congress,
who are wondering when
the McClellan committee
will be getting down to
more serious problems than
those which have been con-
sidered to date. The Beck
situation has been fairly
thoroughly explored, with
results that no doubt will
be wholesome. Next, the
committee has dealt with
another Republican labor
leader, Maurice A. Hutche-
son, and good may well
come of that.
There lie ahead, however,
several other union prob-
lems that may eventually
be more in the national in-
terest than anything that
Beck and Hutcheson may
be accused of.
There is, for example,
the use of violence in cer-
tain labor conflicts such as
the Kohler strike. There
is the use of secondary boy-
cotts, also a feature of the
Kohler strike. There is the
serious issue of the me-
chanics by which union
members are able or un-
able to control their officers.
Most important, it seems
to me, is the use of union
funds in controlling elec-
tions, notably in campaigns
for membership in the
House of Representatives
and the Senate. In the long
run, this will affect govern-
ment itself, unless it is
made subject to the same
regulations which govern
corporations and other
groups and agencies.
The teamsters and car-
penters are not essentially
politically minded unions,
except for forays into local
politics, such as were de-
scribed by witnesses from
Portland, Or. Those unions
have not paid much atten-
tion to national elections.
The more politically in-
terested unions are the two
garment workers' unions,
the steelworkers, and Wal-
ter Reuther's United Auto-
mobile Workers. The Sen-
ate subcommittee investi-
gating the 1956 campaign
reported that the bulk of
the contributions made for
political purposes were by
those unions and by the
railway labor's Political
League.
It would not be strange
if there were strong pres-
sure upon a committee of a
Democratic Congress to
avoid any real investigation
of this political aspect of
the unions. For very little
money was spent by labor
organizations on the elec-
tion of Republican candi-
dates, and a very consid-
erable part of the money
raised by national and local
Democratic organizations
came from unions.
A great deal of talk has
been heard about legisla-
tion to regulate union pen-
sion and welfare funds.
Several bills are pending
with that objective in view.
But the problem involved
in those trust funds is more
on the side of inefficient
management rather than in
the misuse of funds.
It is in the misuse of the
general funds of the
unions, in politics and oth-
erwise, that the real prob-
lem lies.
If and when a leader
like Walter Reuther is sub-
jected to an examination
similar to that which con-
fronted Beck and Hutche-
son, the Detroit leader will
shine with virtue. He is
much too smart to engage
in crude matters of per-
sonal luxuries and graft.
He is austere and meticu-
lous in such matters. He is
not interested in living in a
Beck kind of mansion. His
concern, some say, would
be the White House for
himself, or perhaps to see
that a man of his choice
should reside there. He is
not interested in union-
supported dwelling houses
but in the two Houses of
Congress.
It has been evident in at
least four Democratic Na-
tional Conventions that no
one who is opposed by a
group of labor leaders can
be nominated for President.
Both Harry S. Truman and
Alben Barkley have given
testimony on that subject.
The use of union funds
in politics is a matter
which concerns the very
nature of our government.
The McClellan committee
should not be permitted to
overlook that aspect of
their assignment.
