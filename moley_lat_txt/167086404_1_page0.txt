A CHURCHMAN LOOKS
AT THE SCHOOLS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Most Rev. John F.
O'Hara, Archbishop of
Philadelphia, is not only a
distinguished Catholic prel-
ate but an educator of long
and varied experience. He
spent 27 years as a teacher
and administrator at the
University of Notre Dame,
including five years as
president. Thus his analysis
of the case for Federal aid
for school construction
bears singular importance.
He has recently contrib-
uted two editorials for the
Catholic Standard and
Times of Philadelphia
which comment upon the
latest indications that the
advocates of Federal aid
are in reality in retreat all
along the line.
The Archbishop notes
that some advocates are
saying that it is useless to
play "the numbers game,"
since every figure produced
by the U.S. Office of Edu-
cation is immediately overwhelmed
either by fresh
information from the States
or by some other figure of
the USOE itself. Hence the
zealots would drop their
claim for need entirely and
come back to the stark
demand for some sort of
Federal control, willynilly.

But the Archbishop
argues that without resolving
the statistical tangle
produced by the administration's
own confusion,
there can be no administration
case at all. For has not
the President offered his
program as an undesirable
invasion of State and local
government which is justified
only on grounds of
crying need? And has not
this admission of the undesirability
of Federal interference
been made by
the promise that after four
years the Federal government
will get out of the
business of building
schools?
The Archbishop also calls
attention to a statement
attributed to Secretary Folsom
that "Congress might
as well drop the idea of
Federal aid to education
unless something is done
about it this year." There
can be no interpretation of
this remark except that the
need is diminishing so fast
that in another year no
case, however spurious, can
be made for Federal aid at
all.
Indeed, the Archbishop's
analysis of the administration's
own figures shows
that it is truly "now or
never."
He points out that the
statistical abstract of the
United States shows that
$10,778,000,000 of 1947-49
value, or $12,501,000,000 of
current value, were spent
for public school construction
in the years 1945-55.
Secretary Folsom's Circular
490 shows 62,800 classrooms
built in 1955-56. Applying
this to the dollars
spent in 1955-56, the cost
is $30,000 per classroom.
Thus the total number of
rooms built in 1945-55 must
have been no less than
368,000, and, with the
1955-56 figure added, the
number built up to 1957
was 430,000.
The Archbishop then
notes that Secretary Folsom
says that 69,200 are
scheduled for this year. We
should therefore have 540,000
relatively new classrooms
for use next September.
The government's figure
for the increase in school
registration since the war
is 10,000,000, elementary
and secondary. After deducting
the number accommodated
in nonpublic
schools, the net burden on
the public schools would be
8,250,000. Up to the beginning
of this school year, 14,000,000
desks have been
provided in the new classrooms.
To that number can
be added 2,000,000 desks
by September.
Surely that is enough to
accommodate the growing
school population, after allowing
for other conditions
such as obsolescence. The
Archbishop writes:
"Okay, so drop it,"
seems a natural conclusion.
In another editorial the
Archbishop effectively disposes
of the contention
that, despite the foregoing
figures, there is to be considered
the shift in population
from place to place
which may create vacant
rooms here and an over-
supply of pupils there.
His analysis also shows
some of the unbelievable
contradictions in the administration's
figure. Analyzing
the figures, State by
State, he shows no State
which is not either fully
abreast of its school needs
or rapidly approaching that
goal. Hence, there is little
to justify the President's
contention in a recent press
conference that "... I
imagine, with our growing
population, the deficit will
increase rather than decrease."
Rightly the Archbishop
concludes that it is not
need that concerns the advocates
of Federal aid. It
is Federal control — Federal
control without any lay
interference, with the professionals
in charge.
