RAYMOND MOLEY:
Dam News That's Good
News for Taxpayers
Since the election there
has been much talk in ad-
ministration circles to the
effect that the voters of the
Northwest rejected the
partnership doctrine de-
veloped by the President
and former Interior Secre-
tary McKay. The White
House, however, has re-
cently renewed its alle-
giance to that doctrine.
Some Republican politi-
clans regarded the Republi-
can disasters in Washing-
ton, Oregon and Idaho as a
vote for more Federal
spending on public power
projects, despite plenty of
evidence that many factors
other than public power
were involved in the result.
It seems that Secretary
Fred A. Eaton, a dedicated
politician from a public
power State, Nebraska, ap-
parently chose to believe
that it would be politically
wise to toss some Federal
money into deep canyons of
the Snake River. The des-
perate fight of Sen. Morse
and the labor-union-sup-
ported Hells Canyon Asso-
ciation to get Congress and
then the courts to reverse
the Federal Power Commis-
sion's decision to permit
private development at
Hells Canyon ended in ut-
ter failure. Hence, the pub-
lic power zealots of the
Northwest turned their at-
tention to sites farther
down the Snake.
There was pending be-
fore the Federal Power
Commission an application
by a company set up by
four private utilities to
build two investor-owned
dams, at Pleasant Valley
and Mountain Sheep. The
public power people were
fighting this with great
energy. They favored a
high Federal dam at the
site.
Suddenly, however, they
shifted their demand to the
building of the highest dam
in the world, at a place
called Nez Perce. This
would make the construc-
tion impossible at Pleasant
Valley and Mountain
Sheep, and also flood out
one of the sites assigned to
the Idaho Power Co. in
Hells Canyon.
At this stage, Secretary
Seaton announced his in-
terest in a high Federal
dam at Pleasant Valley.
On inaguration eve in a
television program Seaton
made his proposal public
for the first time. Accord-
ing to very reliable re-
ports published in papers
in the Northwest, Seaton
also drafted a letter to the
Federal Power Commission
proposing that action on the
private company's applica-
tion be held up while the
Interior Department made
plans for a Federal dam.
This apparently precipi-
tated prompt reaction from
Jerome K. Kuykendall,
chairman of the Federal
Power Commission. Ac-
cording to the reports,
Kuykendall, resenting the
interference by a Cabinet
member in the delibera-
tions of what is supposed
to be an independent,
quasi-judicial commission,
protested to the White
House. There Seaton's let-
ter was watered down so
that it meant practically
nothing.
Kuykendall announced
that "the commission does
not consider that the letter
from the Secretary has any
legal effect, substantially
or procedurally." Hence,
the commission will pro-
ceed to deal with the ap-
plication of the private
utility company.
The clear meaning of
this incident is that the
President has no intention
of giving up his partner-
ship policy, and that when
the Federal Power Com-
mission decides that pri-
vate investors' money can
be used to develop such re-
sources as these, it should
be so ordered and sup-
ported by the administra-
tion.
This repudiation of Sec-
retary Seaton's political
preference for Federal
spending should be good
news to every taxpayer.
