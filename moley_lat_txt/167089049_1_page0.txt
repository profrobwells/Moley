Is Russia Revamping
Controlled Economy?
In an interesting novel
entitled "The Great Idea,"
published six years ago,
Henry Hazlitt projected an
imaginary crisis in the So-
viet Russia of the future.
The theme of the book
was that under pressure of
necessity the rulers of that
nation returned step by
step to a capitalist econ-
omy. Like the fanatics of
the French Revolution who
"abolished" God and found
it necessary to create a sub-
stitute, the Communists
found it necessary to recon-
struct piece by piece the
mechanism of a free mar-
ket.

In a recent interview
with Nikita S. Khrushchev,
there is suggested at least
a partial fulfillment of Haz-
litt's prophecy. According
to Khrushchev, the recent
plenum of the Central Com-
mittee of the Communist
Party authorized the aban-
donment of the immensely
powerful but unsuccessful
"Industrial Ministries" in
Moscow and in the "repub-
lics." The control of indus-
try will henceforth be de-
centralized, and "planning"
will be vested in territorial
departments. There will
still be a "Gosplan," which
is the state planning com-
mission. But it will only be
concerned with examining
and reviewing the activi-
ties of the territorial de-
partments. This change is
described by Khrushchev
as "absolutely fundamen-
tal."
It is, indeed, because it
marks the abandonment of
the central idea upon
which the Soviet structure
has stood since Lenin.
*
When Lenin came to the
top of affairs, he had no
plans. He said: "I do not
know of any Socialist who
has dealt with these prob-
lems . . . We need a plan
at once to give the masses
a shining, unimpeded ex-
ample to work for."
The need was filled by a Ger-
man, Walter Rathenau,
who published his plan-
ning scheme in a pamphlet
in 1914. It was called
"Germany's Raw Material
Management." This re-
markable document was
published in many lan-
guages. Four hundred
thousand copies were sold
in an English translation.
From it the British Labor
Party got its working
plans. It was, in effect, an
implementation of Marx-
ism, although it was de-
signed to supply a war
need.
In the United States it is
said to have provided the
basic idea for Bernard
Baruch's War Industries
Board in World War I.
From the experience
gained under Baruch, Gen.
Hugh Johnson created the
NRA.
It is interesting to note
how the idea was seized
by American radicals as a
way to reconstruct our
economy in the 1920s and
early 1930s. A wealth of
material on that subject
has just been published in
a book by Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr., who is not
only a professor but an ac-
tive member of the ADA
and who was an adviser of
Adlai Stevenson in two
campaigns.
The central figure in
Schlesinger's account of
the early New Deal is Rex-
ford G. Tugwell. For a long
time before the depression
Tugwell brooded over what
he conceived to be the fail-
ure of the capitalist econ-
omy. He felt that what was
needed in industry as well
as in agriculture was
"unity" and "co-ordina-
tion" on a national scale.
Schlesinger says that "this
had been achieved onceâ€”
by the War Industries
Board, 'America's war-
time Socialism.' The war,
said Tugwell enviously,
was "an industrial engi-
neer's Utopia . . . only the
armistice prevented a great
experiment in control of
production, control of price
and control of consump-
tion."
*
Since I was very close to
the situation in those days,
I can vouch for this inter-
pretation of Tugwell's
thinking. In fact, his plan-
ning was worked out in
great detail, and I may say
that I always respected his
utter sincerity while I dis-
agreed with his ideas.
It is most interesting that,
just as the Kremlin is dis-
covering a road away after
nearly 40 years of experi-
mentation, our "liberals"
are still chasing the concept
of a centralized government
with economic controls of
various sorts.
It is not only interesting
but almost frightening to
see at the same time that
the Eisenhower administra-
tion is, under the name of
the "New Republicanism,"
veering in the same direc-
tion.
Is it possible that we
must pursue the concept of
central controls to its bitter
end, and abandon the tried
system of local responsibil-
ity? The idea failed in So-
cialist government in Brit-
ain in 1945-51. It is failing
in Russia. It has failed in
East Germany. Is there
nothing that "liberals" can
learn from the past?
