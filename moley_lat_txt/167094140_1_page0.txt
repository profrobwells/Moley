RAYMOND MOLEY:
'Press Lords' Did Not
Defeat Adlai; Ike Did
Adlai Stevenson in seven
different places in his care-
fully prepared speech to
the Democrats of California
complained that the news-
papers and news maga-
zines were unfair to him
in the recent campaign. In
one place he said:
"What the newspapers
and news magazines, the
advertising agencies, the
vast publicity resources of
the government, and big
business and limitless mon-
ey can do to conceal as
well as reveal facts, to di-
vert as well as to attract
attention, to mislead as
well as to lead public opin-
ion, we could, discount at
cur peril."
Also:
"I solemnly assert that
immunity from criticism
from a large segment of
the press, combined with
massive and. skillful use
of propaganda and adver-
tising, have brought us to
a crisis in the honest po-
litical communication on
which an informed electo-
rate must depend."

Similar complaints, more
sharply phrased, are pres-
ent in the labor press.
These, innumerable publi-
cations, which are pub-
lished by the unions, are
certainly under no re-
straints about their own
coloring of the news. But
they loudly complain about
the "kept," "capitalist"
press. Perhaps this outcry
is made in part to obscure
the fact that the union lead-
ers are spending plenty of
the unions' money to get
their own slant on the news
across. They also have
plenty of radio and tele-
vision time in selected
spots.
The Stevenson complaint
is similar to that which was
continually voiced by Pres-
idents Roosevelt and Tru-
man when they were in of-
fice. Roosevelt delighted in
twitting the Washington
working press about their
Republican publishers and
in assuring them that he
had no hard feelings about
them only about their
bosses. The fact was that
a very considerable propor-
tion of the Washington cor-
respondents was thorough-
ly captivated by the great
charmer and probably
voted for him at elections.
The constant complaint
by politicians about the
bias of the press is not
without a subtle purpose.
It is like the screaming at
the umpires in baseball by
managers and players
which, of course, never
changes a decision after it
is made. It is not intended
to influence a past decision
but to cause the arbiter oc-
casionally to give the
breaks to the side that
makes the loudest noise,
just in order to make life
a bit more livable. The
theory is the same with
politicians and ballplay-
ers: it is a conviction that
the squeaky wheel gets
the grease.

While no one can deny
the statistical fact that a
sizable majority of the
daily press in the North
was editorially for Eisen-
hower, it cannot be proved
that, with relatively few
exceptions, the news was
slanted on the Republican
side.
But the complaint over-
looks the fact that the time
has long since passed when
what Stevenson calls a
"press lord" might by fiat
fill the stories of his em-
ployees with bias. The
wide extent to which the
working press in both
newspapers and news mag-
azines is unionized in the
Newspaper Guild is a
strong protection of ten-
ure. Moreover, so far as I
have any knowledge, a
good majority of the work-
ing members of the press
were for Stevenson.
Indeed, in some of the
press the real problem of
the management was to
keep in the middle of the
road despite the efforts of
the people who write the
news to give it the Steven-
son slant. The word "ob-
jectivity" was used so
much that everyone grew
a bit weary of it.
It wasn't the Republi-
can "press lords" who de-
feated Stevenson. It was a
man named Eisenhower,
with a strong assist from
Messrs. Stevenson and Ke-
fauver.
