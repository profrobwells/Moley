In his pleas for Federal
aid for school construction,
including his not very suc-
cessful controversy with
the Chamber of Commerce
of the United States over
the validity of the adminis-
tration's figures on the
need, Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare
Folsom gives every assur-
ance that Uncle Sam will
just give the money and
look the other way so far as
spending is concerned.
In short, the impression
is given that there will be
no Federal control of
schools. But isn't such
control inevitable, consid-
ering the itchy hands of
Washington bureaucrats?
Would not the Federal gov-
ernment be under an ob-
ligation to be responsible
for the grants to the States
in this case?
Thus the administration
is caught in a serious di-
lemma. It must assure—
perhaps should assure—
Congress that it will see
that the money appropri-
ated is providently spent.
And it must, so far as the
political exigencies are con-
cerned, assure the States
that it will not interfere
with the operation and
maintenance of the schools.

Also involved in the
whole question is the estab-
lished fact that when State
and local agencies are
spending their own money
they are more careful to
avoid extravagance than
when they are spending
everybody's money. That
is obvious.
Secretary Folsom takes
great pains also—both in
his statement before the
House committee consider-
ing the subject and in his
letter to the Chamber of
Commerce of the United
States—to claim that while
the Federal government
for some years has been
giving hundreds of millions
for the construction and
maintenance of schools in
areas overburdened be-
cause of Federal defense
installations and other Fed-
eral activities, it has not
exercised any control over
the expenditures of those
funds.
*
According to the revela-
tions to the House by a
very useful member, Rep.
Frank T. Bow of Ohio,
somebody ought to be su-
pervising such gifts, be-
cause of evidence of
wanton extravagance. The
Congressman's interest was
aroused because of the re-
fusal of the school board of
Arlington County, Virginia,
to make public the details
of its budget for 1957-
1958.
It appears that because
of the great Federal burden
on Arlington County the
Federal government paid
about 10% of the costs of
the schools there, both for
maintenance and construc-
tion.
Upon investigation, Rep.
Bow turned up some very
interesting items. There is
in the budget, he says,
$6000 to pay expenses of
employees to conventions
and for training courses at
schools. Those attending
these conventions, whose
expenses the nation's tax-
payers are thus paying,
then pass ringing resolu-
tions in favor of Federal
aid.
*
Of course, there are
many items in school main-
tenance and construction
other than the classrooms
that the President and the
Secretary are talking about
so much. There are inci-
dentals such as school
bands. There are requested
in Arlington "several
sousaphones at costs rang-
ing from $700 to $850" and
also a harp at $1500 and
four pianos at $500 each.
The children of the Fed-
eral bureaucrats living in
Arlington will thus be
amply supplied the means
if not the reality of music.
But the abuse of those
musical instruments must
be something frightful!
For there is an item of
$1900 for piano tuning.
Bow found that a good
piano-tuning job can be
done for a nongovernment-
owned piano for $8.50.
Thus there must be 224
pianos already in Arling-
ton in 44 schools. Strange
that they should need any
more—that is, pianos.
*
A ping-pong table is
needed at $50. This seems
high. There are also items
of furniture for tea rooms
in some schools. Children,
according to Secretary
Folsom, are crowded in
unfit, unsanitary schools.
But teachers must have
their tea, perhaps so that
they can best stand the
horrible sight of crowded
children.
This delineation of what
a school seems to need
these days makes it clear
that Federal aid is not
merely to provide good,
comfortable rooms and
desks and blackboards
where children may learn
the three Rs. There must
be fringe benefits. Or are
they benefits?
