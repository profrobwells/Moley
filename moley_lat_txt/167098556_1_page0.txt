The infinite variety of
Sen. Hubert Humphrey's
contrivances to spend tax-
payers' money and to
thrust the Federal probos-
cis into private affairs is a
source of amazement, won-
der and, occasionally, of in-
nocent merriment.
No cranny of our civiliza-
tion escapes his roving eye,
and no subject flags his
energetic tongue. Recently
he unfolded to the Senate
a scheme to Federalize what
he calls the "living arts."
Since men like the Sena-
tor have little sense of
humor, they often provide
amusement for those who
have. Like John Falstaff,
the Senator bestirs humor
in other men. Thus, when
he says in great seriousness
that there must be "Con-
gressional attention to the
increasingly important role
of the arts in American
life," our risibilities are
stirred. It might be seri-
ously answered that if Con-
gress would find a way to
cut taxes, we might satisfy
our craving for the arts out
of our own pockets.

The Senator points out
that there are more arts
than there used to be. Once
there were seven. Now
there are, he says, 10: mu-
sic, poetry, drama, dance,
the graphic arts, motion
pictures, radio, television,
literature, and the craft
arts. I am glad he has
made a distinction between
television and the drama.
But the Senator would
have us lead the world ar-
tistically. Once there was
a notion that a nation de-
veloped its culture for its
own sake and out of its own
special imagination and cir-
cumstances. Thus the joy
of a person who loved cul-
ture in the discovery of a
wide variety when he trav-
eled abroad. Indeed, over
our own vast nation variety
prevailed and enriched our
minds as we contemplated
it.
Not so with the Senator.
There must be uniformity.
He expressed his desire for
the proliferation of our no-
tions of art over the world.
"Public Law 860 was de-
signed to help expand our
counteroffensive following
evidence from a number of
experts that the American
image abroad has been suf-
fering from the lack of at-
tention to cultural presen-
tations."
This rhetorical scramble
may have had repercus-
sions abroad. For a literate
Englishman might not
know from the context
whom we are intend-
ing to be counteroffensive
against.
But I seem to have for-
gotten what the Senator
wants Congress to enact.
He has three bills. First,
he wants a Federal advis-
ory commission on the arts.
This would not immediate-
ly start handing out money
to would-be artists-who
would no doubt be recom-
mended by Senators on a
state-by-state basis. But
it would plan such hand-
outs. This would provide
the nation with a soil bank
of dancers, actors, and tele-
vision comedians.
Then he would enlarge
the present commission on
fine arts, which has hither-
to concerned itself with
passing on architectural
changes in Washington,
such as the Truman back
stoop. Now this commis-
sion would expand into the
"living arts," presumably
whittling movies and the
drama to the taste of
bureaucrats.

Finally, since the Civil
Service Commission has
had to move to larger quar-
ters because of the prolif-
eration of the bureaucracy,
the Senator would estab-
lish a national art gallery in
the old building. We al-
ready have a national gal-
lery in Washington. But
since it was contributed by
Andrew Mellon, the Sena-
tor probably believes that
it smells too much of cap-
italism and harbors too
much bourgeois art.
There are, of course,
large foundations with lots
of money to spend. Ford,
Rockefeller and Carnegie
come to mind, among
others. But since these
have in recent years been
giving of their wealth to
efforts to rebuild our politi-
cal system, the arts, so the
Senator believes, must be
left to the political govern-
ment.
