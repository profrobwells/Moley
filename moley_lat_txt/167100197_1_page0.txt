ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Hon. John Kennedy,
junior Senator from Massachusetts, is at the moment
widely discussed as a possible Democratic candidate
for President in 1960.
His claim for this is his
indubitable charm, good
looks and pleasant manner.
And since the Democratic
Party, according to such an
eminent authority as the
Hon. Richard Neuberger,
has lost its appeal to the
young voter because of the
machinations of Madison
Avenue in behalf of Ike and
Dick, the possibility of Kennedy is almost a probability.
Reflecting on this current
political opinion, a politician wise in his trade as
well as versed in history
recently commented, "In
this young man is many a
Marius."
His appeal to history was
a comment attributed to
Sulla, the Khrushchev of
the dying Roman Republic
in approximately 82 BC.
Victorious over his rival,
Marius, and deep in a purge
of his enemies, Sulla briefly
considered including in the
proscription one Julius
Caesar, a nephew of Marius
and a playboy of 20. Despite his doubts, Sulla
spared the young Caesar.
The politician's parallel
with Kennedy was the
Franklin D. Roosevelt of
the 1920s, also gifted with
charm, good looks, inherited fortune, and ambition,
but—to the later consternation of conservatives—intellectually committed to centralized government, wide-
spread welfare and big
spending. The Roosevelt of
those years had the undeniable faculty of seeming
to be all things to all men.
In the flush of feature
articles about Kennedy
there is this note, written
by someone who ought to
know better: "Kennedy is
basically a moderate liberal but with many "conservative leanings."
In these days labels like
"liberal" and "conservative" mean so little that
the President has appropriated both. But people are
able to spell out what they
like and do not like from
the record. And the junior
Senator from Massachusetts, while young, has a
considerable voting record
on measures of great current importance.
He could hardly be called
"moderate" since in the selection of test votes on
which the collectivist
Americans for Democratic
Action classified members
of Congress Kennedy voted
their way 12 of 14 times.
By way of comparison, Sen.
Saltonstall, also of Massachusetts, pleased the ADA
only four of 14 times.
In the voting score of the
AFL-CIO Committee on
Political Education, of
which 15,000,000 copies
were circulated in 1956,
Kennedy was well nigh perfect. He satisfied COPE all
but once. Only Federal collectivists like Morse and
Magnuson were perfect.
Kennedy's one defection
from the COPE line was his
vote on rigid agricultural
supports, not an improvident choice for a man from
Massachusetts.
The Congressional Record reveals a rather mediocre contribution to debate. Kennedy's major effort has been a sizable
output of history and statistics against the Mundt
amendment to the Constitution. This was designed
to limit the effort of minorities in the election of a
President by having electors chosen by Congressional Districts. Opposition by minority groups in
the cities defeated the
amendment.
In an article in Life,
which distinguished the
Senator with a cover picture, Kennedy took a lot
of words to say what seems
to mean that there should
be greater and greater
strides toward a Federal
welfare state.
Despite the wide audience of his book, "Profiles
in Courage," the Senator
is not especially articulate.
His appearance in a Democratic television program in
the 1956 campaign was not
exciting. But as Roosevelt
found in his progress to
the Presidency, there are
ways of acquiring articulation.
In an address before the
New Jersey Federation of
Labor this year, Kennedy
strongly opposed any Federal right-to-work law and
indicated that labor had
nothing to fear from the
McClellan committee. He
said that the committee,
of which he is a member,
is basically "pro labor."
In short, the record indicates that the Senator
may qualify as one whom
many conservatives will
believe to be conservative,
but whom "liberals" will
know to be otherwise. A
perfect political setting for
the great adventure.
