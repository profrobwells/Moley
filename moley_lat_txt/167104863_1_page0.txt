SLANTED STUDY VS. REAL RESEARCH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There were criticisms of
the Fund for the Republic
some time ago for employ-
ing Earl Browder in some
sort of study of Commu-
nism. Perhaps those criti-
cisms were not justified.
Browder at least knows
something about the prac-
tical operations of the sub-
ject under study.
But it is not so easy to
explain a study recently
announced by Robert M.
Hutchins, president of the
Fund for the Republic. This
is designed to get at the
"basic issues" of the effect
of corporations and labor
unions on freedom and
civil liberty. For a glance
at the "consultants" who,
with Hutchins and other
fund personnel, will direct
the research, reveals an
astonishing absence of peo-
ple who have ever had any
experience with either cor-
porations or unions.
All except one are pro-
fessors or college admin-
istrators. Only one, Henry
R. Luce, the editor in chief
of Time, Life, and Fortune,
has had to grasp the hot
end of a payroll or deal
with unions at the bargain-
ing table. But his experi-
ence has not been in the
industrial climate which
conditions the problems
with which this study pur-
ports to deal.
Certainly, I raise no eye-
brows at academic people,
for I served my time my-
self. But I did serve long
enough to realize that pro-
fessors and college admin-
istrators have prejudices
just as keen as those of
corporation managers and
union leaders.
Back in 1935 I wondered
what might happen in the
U.S. Treasury when Henry
Morgenthau Jr., then Sec-
retary, told me he could
find no intellectual honesty
for his jobs except among
professors. Even then, he
reposed childlike trust in
Prof. Harry Dexter White.
Among the group select-
ed by Hutchins, the most
active will be Prof. Adolph
A. Berle. His writings have
been anything but objec-
tive toward corporation
problems. His obsession is
the enactment of legisla-
tion for Federal incorpora-
tion of companies doing
interstate business, which
would include about every-
thing but the independent
corner grocery store. Berle,
moreover, was until last
year chairman of the splin-
ter Liberal Party in New
York, which has always
been dominated by David
Dubinsky of the Ladies
Garment Workers. Berle
was also a satellite of the
late Fiorello La Guardia.
How could objectivity be
expected from him?
There is also Reinhold
Niebuhr, the left-wing
vice-president of Union
Theological Seminary.
Thus, this strange, free-
wheeling pot of Ford
money will engage in an-
other piece of slanted pub-
licity under the name of
research.
The exclusion of people
experienced in running cor-
porations and labor unions
makes certain that the per-
sonal views of Hutchins
will have no opposition.
