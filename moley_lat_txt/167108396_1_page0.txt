MR. REUTHER ON TV
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a television program,
Face the Nation, Walter
Reuther, head of the CIO
and the UAW, was able on
Sunday to exercise his ora-
torical genius to the full.
It could scarcely be called
a press conference at all,
so feeble were the efforts
of those present to elicit
anything of substance from
their wily subject.
Presiding was a mighty
serious young man who
was trying to look and talk
as much like Ed Murrow
as was humanly possible.
Three reporters were
either utterly unprepared
with vital questions or
were overawed by the
honor bestowed upon them
by being permitted to
question a man of Reuth-
er's renown.
*
They made it possible
for him to create the im-
pression that all that is
concerned in the travails
of the Teamsters is bribery
and racketeering. This en-
abled Reuther to make the
point that it takes two to
complete a case of bribery,
and that the employer is
just as guilty as the labor
leader. This is quite true,
and, as Reuther said at
great length, both should
go to jail.
But the major problem
in the Beck matter as well
as in most other union af-
fairs is the use of union
funds by union leaders
either for their own per-
sonal benefit or for such ac-
tivities as promoting the
fortunes of candidates in
political campaigns.
The questioners, by a
series of mild feints, made
it possible for the master
of the UAW to make sev-
eral speeches concerning
his new hand-picked re-
view committee of citizens,
the Kohler strike (about
which the reporters
seemed to be completely
ignorant), the Reuther
plan for an investigation of
wages, prices and profits,
the importance of political
"education," and other
topics.
Finally, at the very end
of the show, there was an
opportunity for Reuther
to expound upon the issue
involved in the pending
prosecution of his union
under the Taft-Hartley Act.
This prosecution is based
upon the presentation, on
a program over the air
sponsored and paid for by
the UAW, of a candidate
for election â€” a candidate
supported by the UAW.
The Supreme Court rein-
stated the indictment
which had been set aside
by Judge Picard in a Fed-
eral court in Michigan.
Reuther indicated that
the union's defense in this
case is (a) that the pro-
gram was "educational,"
not political, and (b) that
in the particular instance
upon which the indictment
rests the union had invited
the opposing candidate to
appear and he had de-
clined. The defense would
be "free speech" under the
First Amendment.
The trick of inviting both
candidates to a show spon-
sored by the opposition is
not new. Its political im-
port is to get the added ad-
vantage of attracting fol-
lowers of the opposition
candidate to listen to a per-
formance in which the
sponsor union poses as a
great benefactor and ex-
ponent of giving the op-
position a forum. "Just
think, folks, we are pay-
ing for time on the air to
let our opponent present
his case."
Quite properly, the op-
position candidate de-
clined to be trapped into
such a position. Then the
UAW program presented
only its own favored can-
didate.
*
If we are to argue the
matter of freedom of
speech under the First
Amendment, the right to
decide when and where to
speak is sacred, too.
Mr. Reuther's defense
will have hard going
against the declaration of
the Supreme Court that
the act involved was a vio-
lation of the law. Also,
that if the Taft-Hartley
provision prohibiting
unions from making politi-
cal contributions is over-
turned, the older law
against contributions by
corporations must go, too.
These vital points the
Face the Nation interro-
gators completely missed,
and, of course, Reuther
was not there in order to
help them out.
