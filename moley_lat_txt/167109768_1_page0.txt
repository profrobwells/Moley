RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Political Price
of Hell's Canyon Dam
SPOKANE, Wash.—The
Democratic leadership of
the U.S. Senate not only
makes a mockery of its pretensions to economy, but
must bear the heavy suspicion that it was, in passing
the Hells Canyon authorization bill, engaging in an
operation for political advantage. In passing the authorization it indicated that
it would pay hundreds of
millions of the taxpayers’
money.
Let us note at the outset
that for 10 years Congress
has refused to pass a bill
authorizing a Federal dam
at Hells Canyon, although
immense political pressure
has been exerted in its behalf. During five of those
years a Democrat was in
the White House and Democratic majorities ruled
Congress. Moreover, the
Washington State Legislature refused to pass a memorial to Congress urging
the passage of the dam bill.
Since the vote rejecting
the dam last year, however,
Sen. Wayne Morse has been
re-elected and has become
a major factor on the Democratic side. The passion of
his life has been to smite
the Idaho Power Co. and to
get a Federal dam authorized at Hells Canyon. The
realization of the Morse
dream will, it is believed,
assure the Senator’s loyal
support for Democratic
causes in years to come.
The switch of a number
of southern Senators is
openly rumored to be on
account of the possibility of
a delay in the passage of a
civil rights bill, for which
the hearts of many northern liberal Democrats have
been bleeding for a long
time. Whether or not this
rumor is true, the bill was
passed under circumstances
which bestow no credit on
many of the Senators who
voted for it,
For the matter reeks
with hypocrisy. No doubt
Senators who supported it
this year realize that the
vote was an empty gesture.
The measure, even if
passed by the House, must
go to a President who has
made his opposition to it a
major administration policy. Can anyone believe
that he will fail to veto it?
Moreover, even if the
President should sign it,
the victory would be far
from won. As they say up
here in the Northwest: “An
authorization is merely a
hunting license for an appropriation.” It would be
another year before any
such appropriation could
be passed.
Meanwhile, according to
latest reports, the Idaho
Power Co., under its license
from the Federal Power
Commission (affirmed by
the Supreme Court), has
been hard at work for more
than a year and a half and
will be producing electricity at one of its three projects in another year.
The hullabaloo about the
tax amortization write-off
has been answered by the
refusal of the Idaho Power
Co. to avail itself of this
legitimate right.
The company says it has
already spent or obligated
$57,000,000 in construction.
This and much more would
probably have to be paid in
reimbursement by Federal
taxpayers. That would
mean endless litigation.
In short, in the name of
satisfying a demand for
public power in the Northwest, the Senate majority
has tried to make certain
that the electric power
needed will be delayed for
years.
So far as cost is concerned, consider these figures: the advocates of the
Federal dam say that the
costs will be repaid with interest. That is true only of
the costs allocated to power. But the following is a
minimum estimate of the
taxpayers’ burden: $48,000,000 for the nonreimbursable items of flood control
and navigation; $5,000,000
for fish and wild life; $48,000,000 reimbursement to
the Idaho Power Co.; $282,126,300 Federal income
taxes to be paid during a
50-year period by the Idaho Power Co.; $20,000,000
nonreimbursable Federal
operation and maintenance
for the Federal dam.
This grand total of more
than $400,000,000 has no
compound-interest gimmick such as was used in
criticizing the Idaho Power
amortization write-off.
This is what the “economy-minded” Democratic
leadership is willing to
spend for political advantage.
