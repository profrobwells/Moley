CHANGING
SOUTH?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The remains of many a
departed southern states-
man, from Robert Young
Hayne to Cordell Hull, may
be tossing uneasily in their
last resting places because
of what is happening to
their principles in their
part of the nation.

A shift away from inter-
nationalism was sharply
emphasized in what a Dem-
ocratic majority did to the
President's request for for-
eign aid. Majority Leader
Johnson, aided by Sens.
Long and Ellender of Lou-
isiana, was foremost in
the fight for reduction. In
fact, the most powerful in-
dictment of the giveaway
program was Ellender's re-
port on his tour of 33 na-
tions last year.

According to a recent ar-
ticle on the South's retreat
from internationalism in
the magazine Newsweek,
69% of the South's repre-
sentatives in the years im-
mediately before World
War II voted for all inter-
nationalist measures before
Congress, while another
29% voted for three-fourths
of them. Only 14% of New
Englanders voted for all of
them.

In the early postwar pe-
riod, Southerners almost
unanimously voted for aid
to Greece and Turkey, and
the Marshall Plan. But in
1951 southern opposition to
the Marshall Plan jumped
from 3 to 21%.

In 1955, on the vote for
reciprocal trade, there
were 16 southern members
of the House who voted
against it, while two years
before there had been only
one in the negative.

Next year, when the act
comes up for renewal, it
may be doubtful whether
it can summon enough
votes to pass.

In the Newsweek article
there is summarized from
reports of correspondents
over the whole South the
consensus that these Con-
gressional votes mirror the
changing sentiments of the
people.

It is pointed out that the
basic reason for the change
is the overthrow of King
Cotton as the major con-
cern in the South. Indus-
trialization is growing with
incredible speed. Textiles,
chemicals, glass, plywood,
and other products need
protection and are going to
get it. There is, moreover,
no desire among remaining
cotton planters to have our
government subsidize for-
eign growing of that com-
modity.

Twenty years ago it was
amusing to hear two such
good friends and allies as
John N. Garner and Sam
Rayburn argue about pro-
tectionism. But the cause
of the difference was cot-
ton in East Texas and cat-
tle in West Texas. Speaker
Rayburn is not so sure now
about the virtues of free
trade.

This shift in emphasis is
coming just as the Eisen-
hower administration is be-
coming more and more
internationalist. Can it be
that ultimately the histori-
cal positions of the two
parties will be reversed?
