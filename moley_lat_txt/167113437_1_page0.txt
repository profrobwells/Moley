RAYMOND MOLEY:
Grants-in-Aid Are
Commands to Spend
Despite plenty of evi- States were paying plenty
dence to the effect that no for aid, much of which is
more commissions are for activities that they
needed to demonstrate that would not otherwise under-
the Federal government take.
ought to stop taking over
the revenues and responsi-
bilities of the States, the
President has launched his
so-called "Joint Federal-
State Action Committee."
Gov. Stratton of Illinois
has appointed himself and
nine other Governors as the
members representing the
States. And so we shall,
after a year or so, have an-
other report which will
probably coincide with a
Presidential request for
more Federal programs for
the taking away of more of
the responsibility of the
States. This may well in-
clude the twice-rejected
school construction pro-
gram. This merry rounde-
lay has been going on for
many years.
While this ponderous
new committee is getting
under way, I suggest that
it consider a new and very
serious aspect of this prob-
lem, pointed out by an en-
terprising State Senator in
Nebraska, Ray C. Simmons.
Considerably earlier this
year I described in one of
these articles a remarkable
resolution of, the Nebraska
Legislature, which pointed
ly said that Nebraska want-
ed the Federal government
to stop paralyzing State
governments through
grants-in-aid. Later, the
New Hampshire Legisla-
ture passed an identical
resolution.
Simmons realizes that
something more than reso-
lutions are needed to halt
the Federal invasion. Per-
haps he thought that if the
States could be convinced
that these Federal grants
were not something for
nothing, they might get
more courage to resist. And
so he asked the director of
the Nebraska Legislative
Council to prepare a report
showing how much more
the States themselves had
to expend in order to qual-
ify for certain kinds of Fed-
eral aid. In other words, he
wanted to show that the
The report shows clearly
that Federal grants-in-aid
not only are the deadly en-
emy of economy in the
Federal realm but they in-
duce extravagance at the
State level.

The Budget Committee
recommended a total two-
year expenditure of $294,-
000,000, of which 39% was
Federal money. Later, how-
ever, the Legislature, be-
cause of new and addition-
al Federal grants, increased
its spending program for
the two years to $334,000,-
000. Of this, 43% was Fed-
eral money. But in order
to get this Federal money,
in almost all instances, the
State was compelled to in-
crease its own taxes. For
example, in order to qual-
ify for Federal highway
money the State was com-
pelled to increase its gaso-
line tax another cent per
gallon.
The theory of Federal
grants-in-aid is an enact-
ment in real life of the car-
rot-and-the-donkey idea.
A bribe is offered to induce
greater expenditure by the
States for purposes that
the President and Con-
gress, not the States them-
selves, consider desirable.
The donkey gets the carrot
in this case, but only by
putting in more effort than
it would otherwise have
expended, and also by go-
ing in a direction deter-
mined by somebody in
Washington.

This bit of bribery hits
the taxpayer on several
sides. His Federal income
tax and his State and local
taxes are all affected by it.
Incidentally, Sen. Sim-
mons also points out that
the enormous increase in
Federal aid is reflected in
the State budget. In the bi-
ennium preceding this one,
Federal grants-in-aid funds
made up 27%. In this one
the percentage is 43.
