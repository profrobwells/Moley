THE USIA
ROLE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his press conference
last week the President se-
verely criticized the House
of Representatives for
cutting the request in his
budget for the U.S. Infor-
mation Agency. This he
called "the worst kind of
economy" and asserted
that the sort of operation
carried on by that agency
was not something that
should be diminished but
rather increased as a func-
tion of government.
The action of the House
to which he referred was a
slash of $37,900,000 in the
amount requested for fiscal
1958. This would leave
$106,100,000 for the agency.
It would be $6,900,000 less
than the agency used last
year.
What the President said
in defending the original
request concerning the ob-
jective sought is perfectly
true — "the job of explain-
ing to the world what we
are trying to do to keep
our aspirations, our activi-
ties straight before the
minds of all our friends as
well as others."
★
The point, however, is
not that the House disap-
proved of such a worthy
objective. The criticism of
the USIA was that many
of its activities were not of
such a nature as would do
much except to confuse
foreigners as to what our
"aspirations and activities"
really are.
If he would read the de-
bate in the House, in which
the major criticism of the
agency was made by Rep.
Rooney, and some of the
comments by members of
his own party, he would
realize that, before asking
for an increase of some-
thing like $25,000,000 in
the appropriation for this
agency, he should insist
that some of the nonsense
for which money is being
spent now should be elim-
inated.
If I am asked for money
to support a religious sect
in which the central figure
is a whirling dervish and
I refuse, it would hardly
be fair to say that I am
opposed to religion.
Congressmen cannot be
blamed for objecting to the
spending of $433,000 for
subscriptions to two New
York newspapers for many
prominent people. Perhaps
it would be helpful if for-
eigners were to read more
of our newspapers and
magazines. But when a se-
lection is made which pre-
fers New York papers over
all others, it is not out of
order to suggest that there
are other, equally good
newspapers published
which reflect the aspira-
tions and activities of oth-
er parts of the country.
★
Nor can members of the
House be blamed for en-
livening their dull and try-
ing job of serving the tax-
payers by discussing and,
indeed, questioning the cul-
tural value of sending Diz-
zy Gillespie abroad at $2150
a week, with 15 accompany-
ing musicians and two vo-
calists, a baggageman and
a lecturer who was unable
to speak the language of
the country to which he
was assigned.
But as some might say,
even though there are
items which are subject to
criticism, such as the Gil-
lespie item, that should not
condemn the entire opera-
tion. There is, however, a
solid mass of criticism con-
cerning the past operations
of our propaganda agencies
which cannot be rejected as
prejudiced.
It would seem that since
the President has appoint-
ed a new head for the
USIA, Arthur Larson, it
might be well to direct him
to reorganize the setup as
it is under the appropria-
tion this year, before add-
ing the many new activi-
ties which were contem-
plated by the 25% request-
ed increase.
★
It might also be said that
the best sort of way to ad-
vertise the virtues of our
country abroad is to send
better Ministers and Am-
bassadors. It would be help-
ful, too, to eliminate such
absurdities in economic aid
as were pointed out by Sen.
Ellender in his report of his
travels in many countries
since the last session of
Congress.
It is the quality of our
Information Service, not its
fundamental purpose, that
has brought such a sharp
criticism of the size of the
increase requested by the
President.
