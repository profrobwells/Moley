Laws on Lobbying
Are Hard to Write
In every session of Congress proposals are made
to limit or prohibit certain
kinds of lobbying. But so
far no one has found a way
of effectively eliminating
all bad lobbying without
impairing the rights of
good lobbying.
For good lobbying is simply a method by which the
citizens of the nation may
exercise their constitutional
right of petition.
Perhaps, however, new
conditions will solve the
problem by making direct
lobbying by representatives
of private interests in
Washington less and less
effective. There is every
reason to believe that the
most effective place to
work for legislation is at
the spot where lawmakers
are made—that is, the precincts and districts at home
—rather than at the place
where laws are made.

An especially clumsy bill
appeared in Congress this
year, sponsored by a Special Committee to Investigate Political Activities,
Lobbying and Campaign
Contributions. Sen. McClellan was chairman of
this committee. It submitted its report in May, together with a draft bill,
SB 2191.
This bill would broaden
the scope of control over
lobbying by specifying two
types of pressure: first, the
traditional method of appeal directly to committees
or members of Congress;
second, "artificial stimulation of the public intended
to produce direct communications with the Congress."
A "legislative agent," or
lobbyist, is a person who,
"for any consideration, is
employed or retained to influence legislation, in person or through any other
person, by means of direct
communication." Such a
person must register. Thus,
a person is a lobbyist who
stimulates citizens, wherever they may be, to write,
telephone, telegraph or
speak to a member of Congress.
★
This definition is limited, however. For a lobbyist under such unlimited
terms might be an editorial
writer in a remote town in
California who might suggest that his readers write
to Sen. Knowland in behalf
of a dam on Snake Oil
Creek.
The bill would require
reports to the Comptroller
General of lobbying activity only if the request to
citizens to communicate
with their Congressmen is
in writing and addressed or
distributed to more than
1000 persons, or if the person who stimulates the people to communicate with
their representatives pays
for their letters, telegrams
or what not. This makes it
clear that what is meant as
lobbying is the mass letter
or telegram crusades in
which some interest pays
for the communications and
merely inserts names of citizens.
★
The really bad part of
the bill, however, is a provision which would prohibit the stimulation of
citizens to communicate
with Congress not necessarily by a direct request
but by implication. The
definition of such stimulation is that it may be implicit as well as explicit.
This would seem to apply to anyone who publishes a paid advertisement
opposing or supporting
some matter of legislation
and which moves, by implication, 1000 people to
communicate.
The fact is that lobbying,
either by representatives
domiciled in Washington
or by people stimulating
letter-writing campaigns, is
yielding less and less for
the money spent. It is
vastly more important to
spend money and effort at
home in opposing bad
members of Congress at
the polls or in supporting
good ones.
★
The leaders of unions,
through their AFL-CIO
COPE, operate to get votes
for or against members.
Then when they send somebody to Washington to talk
about legislation they get a
very thoughtful hearing.
For politicians, in Congress,
or elsewhere, are generally moved not by abstract
arguments about legislation but by how many
votes the man who is arguing can produce.
It is my considered opinion that about 85% of the
money that businesses and
their trade organizations
spend on Washington lobbies is wasted. In short, no
cocktail party, however
stimulating, or chart or
speech, however logical,
can overcome the lack of
activity at home.
A Congressman has a
right to say to himself:
"How many votes has this
fellow got?" or "Where was
this guy when I was running for my life at the last
election?"
