In a previous article I
noted that Negro voters in
the recent election in New
York indicated no disposi-
tion to switch to the Re-
publican ticket despite the
efforts of the administra-
tion to win them. This was
especially true in the baili-
wick of Congressman
Adam Clayton Powell in
New York.
This election, compared
with the last preceding
Mayoralty balloting in
1953, shows that in two
solid Negro Assembly dis-
tricts in the heart of Pow-
ell's Congressional district
only 1276 more Republican
votes were cast this year
in a total of about 50,000
votes. During those four
years there was the mo-
mentous Warren segrega-
tion decision, the struggle
over a civil rights bill and
the recent events in Little
Rock. The Negroes simply
ignored the bait.
The results in New Jer-
sey bring home the same
lesson. When Gov. Meyner
ran before in 1953, New-
ark's Central Ward-heav-
ily Negro-gave the Re-
publican candidate 38.5%
of the total. This year the
Republican captured only
38.9%. This was despite
frantic appeals directly to
Negroes by Candidate
Forbes and various admin-
istration spokesmen ask-
ing them to support the
party which was engaged
in their betterment. The
margin by which the Dem-
ocratic vote was cut in this
large area was exactly 111
votes.
In Montclair's 4th Ward,
which is more than 80%
Negro, Meyner actually
gained 109 votes over his
1953 showing, while the
Republican gain was only
25.
The news from Louis-
ville, Ky., bears out the
same lesson.
On the other hand, con-
sider what Brownell-
Eisenhower policy tossed
away. The State of Vir-
ginia had come a great dis-
tance from the days of Re-
construction, so far as the
Republican Party was con-
cerned. In the gubernatori-
al race in 1953 the Repub-
lican candidate received
45% of the vote. The same
Republican candidate this
year was thrashed 2 to 1.
In 1953 Republican gu-
bernatorial candidate Dal-
ton carried the 6th Con-
gressional District by 5000
votes. This year he lost it
by more than 8000. If any
such Republican losses ap-
pear in Congressional elec-
tions next year, Republi-
can Congressmen in mar-
ginal and critical districts
in Southern and border
States may well go down
in defeat.
Thus, for mere handfuls
of Negro voters in a num-
ber of northern cities—
too small a number to
count in any normal elec-
tion—the Republican Lit-
tle Rock strategists prob-
ably have thrown away
several members of the
House as well as abandon-
ing any chance to carry
Southern States in a Presi-
dential election.
