RAYMOND MOLEY:
Enforced Unionism
and Political Freedom
When the Supreme Court
returns in the autumn and
resumes its work of shear-
ing away the remaining
powers and authority of the
States, it may find a problem
which will require considerable
ingenuity to solve.
The Supreme Court of the
State of Georgia, relying on
a sentence in the U.S. Supreme
Court’s opinion in the Hansen
case, which upheld the closed
shop under the Railway Labor
Act, has declared that the closed
shop cannot be enforced if the
member’s dues or contributions
are used to support ideological
issues and candidates to which he
is opposed.

This strikes directly at the
very foundation of the power
which unions exercise. That is
to use the closed shop to make
captive not only the general funds
of unions but the officers thereof,
and to use these for the promotion
of the political purposes of the
union leaders.
In fact, in such unions as the
Steelworkers and the United
Automobile Workers, compulsory
membership in the union practically
means compulsory membership in
the Democratic Party. True, the
member may vote as he pleases, but
his dollars are used to pressure
people to register and, to indoctrinate
them over the air, in print, and by
the spoken word.
While the advocates of the
administration’s civil rights bill are
working up a big hullabaloo about
the right to vote, nothing is said
about this denial of a worker’s right
to have his money used to support a
trade union rather than a political
party. This use of the general funds
of captive unions is defended under
the semantic trick of calling political
activities educational.
The sentence upon which the
Georgia court relied was: “Judgment
is reserved as to the validity or
enforceability of a union or closed-
shop agreement if other conditions
of union membership be imposed or
if the exaction of dues, initiation
fees or assessments is used as a
cover for enforcing ideological
conformity or other action in contravention
of the First and Fifth Amendments.”
The Georgia court made this
judgment based upon that dictum in
the Hansen decision: “We must render
judgment now upon this precise
question. We do not believe one can
constitutionally be compelled to
contribute money to support ideas,
politics and candidates which he
opposes. We believe his right to
immunity from such exaction is
superior to any claim the union can
make upon him.”

In March the Supreme Court
decided that the government’s
indictment against the UAW for a
violation of the Taft-Hartley Act,
because of a political broadcast paid
out of union funds, should be reinstated.
Justice Frankfurter made it fairly
clear that such activities were not
merely educational but political.
Thus, the Supreme Court may be
caught by its own admissions. But
considering the fact that new members
have mounted the bench there is no
way of telling how consistent the high
court may be. Recent decisions offer
no great hope on that score. But it
will take a good deal of rationalization
to justify taking a man’s money to
expound ideas and policies to which
he is opposed.
