COLUMBIA, S.C., -
I shall have considerably
more to report concerning
my impressions of this
crisis in the South, but it
suffices to note today that
I was struck by the calm
that prevails here and else-
where in this State.
There is a great contrast
between the headlines and
editorials in the news-
papers of both the Caro-
linas and the blatantly pro-
vocative treatment of the
issue in most of the New
York papers, even the
oracular Times. The people
of South Carolina have
much to teach New York
about history and consti-
tutional principles. They
can also teach New York
and Washington a lot
about good manners.
Everyone I have seen-
and I have seen a good
many responsible leaders
here-emphasizes the need
for restraint. Indeed, the in-
fluential Charleston News
and Courier suggests that
passive resistance of the
Gandhi type may be the
best policy for the South.
When I saw that, I re-
called the words of a Re-
publican political leader in
Harlem, who said only a
few days ago that "we
didn't really give the
South a good lesson in the
Civil War and this time
we will have to go in and
finish the job."
However, the feelings of
leaders in South Carolina
are intense. Their most
potent ground for resent-
ment is the obvious effort
of members of the Wash-
ington administration to
seize all the political ad-
vantages possible out of
this crisis.
They feel that the archi-
tect of the President's pol-
icy has been Atty. Gen.
Brownell, as cold and cal-
culating a politician as has
ever occupied high office in
the United States. It is be-
lieved that while the Presi-
dent had committed him-
self to the appointment of
Earl Warren to an asso-
ciate justiceship, it was
Brownell who engineered
the designation of the Cal-
ifornian to the Chief Jus-
ticeship in order to fore-
stall a primary fight be-
tween Warren and Good-
win Knight in 1954.
In the long legal contest
which ended in the inte-
gration decision in 1954,
Brownell's activity was re-
sented. The vacancy in
the Federal court of East-
ern Arkansas has been
permitted to remain for
months this year because
the Attorney General has
been looking for a Repub-
lican to appoint. Such in-
sistence on Republicans
for Federal courts appar-
ently does not apply to the
Supreme Court.
Brownell is also blamed
for bringing in Judge
Davies, an Eisenhower-
Brownell appointee, from
North Dakota, In the Ei-
senhower-Faubus confer-
ence, things apparently
went well until Brownell
entered the room. And
just last week the Presi-
dent had already agreed to
accept the promise of Fau-
bus, to take over, but re-
versed himself completely
after a conference with
Brownell.
There are other mem-
bers of the Eisenhower re-
gime who are blamed for
putting a political edge on
this grave episode. While
the Republican Party of
the South is lying on its
back emitting unmistak-
able death rattles, Sher-
man Adams is rushed to
Tennessee to administer
restoratives.
The selection of George
Meany to explain to the
world through the United
Nations how wonderfully
the President is doing is
bitter medicine. While
Meany was laboring to de-
feat loyal Republicans,
leading South Carolinians
were speaking and voting
for the President in 1952
and 1955.
Leaders in the South
draw the inescapable in-
ference that the White
House is deliberately mak-
ing a bid for the Negro
vote in northern cities
while rendering hopeless
any chance to create a
two-party system in the
South. This Brownell-
Adams strategy will meet
its first test in the munici-
pal election in New York
City this fall. We shall see
how permanent the alli-
ance proves to be.
