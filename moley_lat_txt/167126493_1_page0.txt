RAILS AND
ROADS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From time to time, a
suggestion has been made
to utilize railroad rights
of way in construction of
the vast network of super-
highways on which the
States and Federal gov-
ernment are now em-
barked.
Estimates of cost have
already begun to increase.
In addition, delays may
lengthen the 16-year pe-
riod planned for the pro-
gram to hook up cities of
more than 50,000 popula-
tion by something more
than 41,000 miles of super-
highways. Reports of the
shaky financial conditions
of some of our most recent
toll roads do not brighten
the vista our highway de-
partments and public
works people had bathed
with sunshine of opti-
mism.
*
The problems of acquir-
ing rights of way remain
difficult, whatever ap-
proach is made. This sum-
mer I examined the views
of D. Walter Swan, a for-
mer Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary in the Defense De-
partment, who suggested
that arrangements might
be worked out with the
railroads for the use of
practicable portions of
some of the 220,000 miles
of existing railroad rights
of way. This would seem
in many instances emi-
nently logical, economical,
and, for the railroads, a
source of welcome reve-
nue.
In recent weeks I have
received a number of sup-
plementary views from
people in the railroad in-
dustry and others, which
deserve consideration.
While it appears that the
railroads have no objection
to considering the use of
certain abandoned railroad
rights of way, they would
undoubtedly oppose vigor-
ously the use of rights of
way at ground level paral-
leling the railroad tracks
within 1000 or 2000 feet.
In many localities this is
understandable and sound.
It is not only in the rail-
roads' interest but in the
interest of the community
as well to preserve ade-
quate space for future in-
dustrial or commercial ex-
pansion. One railroad ex-
ecutive puts it this way:
"There would be many,
many instances where
such use, by a highway
would prevent the railroad
from serving an existing
industry in a satisfactory
manner, but probably
more important than that
is the fact that a highway
paralleling the railroad
track would put the track
more or less 'in the groove'
so that the railroad would
not be able to branch out
to serve prospective future
industries."
*
The railroads have al-
ready fought and won the
battle of routes. Their ap-
proaches to metropolitan
centers have strongly in-
fluenced present industrial
and urban development,
and in many places rail-
road lines lead straight to
the heart of cities. Mod-
ern technology is reduc-
ing the number of tracks
needed to handle the vol-
ume of traffic.
Where industrial devel-
opment is completed, the
modern interchange on
high-speed highways is a
vast, sprawling complex
and extremely expensive.
A highway paralleling rail-
road tracks could be con-
structed at far less ex-
pense, according to high-
way engineers, with some
stretches as elevated ex-
pressways over the tracks,
and with access ramps
over existing streets.
In areas where future
industry and commerce
are anticipated, certainly
community planning must
take into account service
by both highway and rail-
road and must avoid un-
wise proximity.
*
There remain, however,
hundreds of miles of farm-
land which will remain
farmland, and thousands
of miles of rangeland
which will remain for
grazing livestock. In rural
areas, to stretch a high-
way along a railway
would mean taking a con-
tinuous strip from back
lots of farms when neces-
sary. Cutting through a
freeway means splitting up
parcels of land. In the end,
it would be less expensive
to build overpasses.
We face the staggering
and burgeoning problems
of easier access to and
from the centers of our
traffic-snarled cities. These
are problems to challenge
the talents and reasoning
of engineers, lawyers, gov-
ernment officials, resi-
dents and businessmen,
including those whose
service is with the rail-
roads.
