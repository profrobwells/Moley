Government is a many-
headed thing in which the
acts of one head have no
binding force in law or
morals on another. Collec-
tively, we deny every prin-
ciple of right to which, as
individuals, we have given
lip service over the many
centuries of recorded his-
tory.
Soviet Russia is, of
course, the greatest present
example of government per-
fidy. Its promises through
Stalin are not only uncol-
lectible from Khrushchev,
but they were ignored by
Stalin himself.
But let us look in our
own eye and see if there is,
perhaps, not a beam, but a
mote therein. Just how
much can we depend upon
the promises of people who
happen to be vested with a
bit of temporary authority?
A fat volume could be
collected with such items
as Theodore Roosevelt's as-
surance in 1902 that the
reclamation fund would be
a revolving affair, into
which happy farmers would
pay back the government's
loan within 10 years and
then new farmers would
use that money to make
them happy.

Perhaps that is the way
T. R. planned it, and he
was a man who extolled
what he called "the ele-
mental virtues." But, the
fact is that he was barely
out of office before his
successor, the blunt Wil-
liam H. Taft, announced
that the reclamation fund
was in the red, that farm-
ers could not pay out, and
that more money would
have to come from all the
rest of us-namely, the tax-
payers.
In 1955, the last time I
checked the subject, only
one reclamation project
had paid out of the many,
many started after 1902,
and I venture to say that
when the year 2002 comes
around there will not be
more than four such.
Still, members of Con-
gress have the gall to stand
up and tell us that recla-
mation projects that are be-
ing authorized today will
pay out, although the cost
per acre averages many
times what it did 50 years
ago.
Now let us look at Social
Security. I pointed out in
an article earlier this sum-
mer what a hoax on us all
was perpetrated when the
system was established and
we were told that old-age
assistance was a temporary
matter. Sponsors of the
scheme said that when
OASI got going and retir-
ing people were getting
that form of relief to which
they had actually con-
tributed something, OAA
would vanish.
Instead of vanishing,
OAA is here and growing
every year.
Now here is another ex-
ample. As recently as 1954,
when legislation was enact-
ed "liberalizing" the pro-
gram, we were told that
no deficit financing would
be necessary for "at least
25 or 30 years."
*
Last year, when the hot
breath of an election was
blowing upon the necks of
statesmen, the system was
"liberalized" again, and it
was predicted that during
fiscal 1957 contributions to
the fund would amount to
$7,300,000,000 against pay-
outs of $6,800,000,000 with
a resulting surplus of $500,-
000,000, plus a further mar-
gin from "investment in-
come."
Now, however, the fig-
ures are out. It is the pay-
out side that amounts to
$7,300,000,000, while the
contributions may be not
more than $7,000,000,000.
The result would be, ex-
cept for $600,000,000 from
"investment income," that
the fund for the year would
show a deficit.
But even this help from
"investment income" will
be inadequate to save the
fund from a deficit in fiscal
1959. Then, in 1960, the
taxes will go up again.
And still there are doz-
ens of bills in the hopper
to "liberalize" Social Secu-
rity.
