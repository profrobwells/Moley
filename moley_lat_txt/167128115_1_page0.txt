RAYMOND MOLEY:
Knowland or Knight
---It Can't Be Both:
SANTA BARBARA -
After two weeks in California, I have reached this
point on my trip southward
without any definitive information about the major
question that is agitating
political minds in this State
and elsewhere: "Is Sen.
Knowland going to run for
Governor next year?"
This ignorance on my
part persists even after discussing the subject with
many wise Californians
and after reading the reflections of experienced
commentators in the newspapers.
★
It was written in our
textbooks, perhaps without
substantiation, that schoolmen of the Middle Ages engaged in disputations over
such special problems as
how many angels might
stand on the head of a pin.
The underlying question
here is equally difficult,
but of far greater practical
importance. It is: "How
many ambitious political
leaders can one State, however spacious, afford?"
For despite the vast territorial reaches of California
and despite the immense population that is
gathering here, the State
can have only one Governor and ultimately only
one Presidential preference.
Perhaps an omnipotent
Providence could help by
cutting the State in twain.
But even that could not accommodate the ambition of
Gov. Knight to succeed
himself, although it would
provide the opportunity for
both Vice-President Nixon
and Sen. Knowland to be
favorite sons.
★
As it stands now, Gov.
Knight is announcing at
every occasion he has to
speak—and he has a facility of creating occasions
when none is proffered—
that he intends to run for
Governor, come Knowland
or high water. Hence, Knight
is digging himself in. His
method of digging in is to
hunt out all the people of
the State whom he has offended or disappointed by
some of his utterances and
to assure them that he
didn't mean it.
The danger to party success in case of a contest
cannot daunt Sen. Knowland, who has a way of
making up his mind all by
himself, and, having made
it up, of charging head on
for his objective—Knight
or no Knight.
But he has other considerations. Would he be in
a better position to gather
delegates from the 47 other
States if he were a busy
Governor or a private citizen able to travel far and
wide? For, despite California's size and wealth of
Presidential material, it requires the co-operation of
other States to make up a
majority in the Republican
convention. Plain Mr.
Knowland would have a
real hearing in States
through the Midwest which
are weary of New Republicanism.
There is also the feeling
of many Californians that
when they hire a Governor
for four years they expect
four years of sound and dependable service. That is
what former Gov. Earl
Warren offered in 1944 as
his reason for refusing to
run for Vice-President.
There were cynics at the
time who believed that
Warren really felt that nobody could defeat a Roosevelt ticket. However, there
is that consideration which
faces Knowland.
★
Perhaps Knowland might
resort to the device adopted
by one Thomas E. Dewey
in 1942 when he offered
himself for Governor despite a widespread belief
that he wanted to run for
President in 1944. On that
occasion Dewey put together some words at the Republican State convention
which, to my literal mind,
meant that he intended to
remain in Albany four
years.
But by a sophistry—not
unusual in Dewey—they
were interpreted later as a
purely personal intention
which could be overruled
by the higher tribunal of
the Republican Party in
convention assembled.
Since the voters of the nation decided to keep Dewey
in Albany, no questions
were subsequently raised.
However, in the case of
Knowland we are dealing
with a man who indulges
in no sophistry and he will
not tell Californians that
he will not run for President in 1960 unless he
means it.
Thus the political air is
misty but stimulating. Despite a disinclination to
prophesy, I suggest that if
Knowland decides to run
for Governor he will win
the nomination and election. Somebody will, as
Knight predicts, be hurt,
but that somebody will be
no other than Knight.
