SEN. SALTONSTALL'S BUDGET BILL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When Leverett Salton-
stall was Governor of Mas-
sachusetts, he followed the
good tradition of Coolidge
economy. He believed in
paying debts.
The Senator has now in-
troduced a bill, on which
hearings were held recent-
ly, which would enforce
upon Congress and the
President a plan to reduce
the national debt system-
atically and at the same
time put a wholesome
check upon spending and
encourage tax reduction.
*
The bill is entitled Pub-
lic Debt Reduction Act of
1957. Under its provision
the national debt would be
reduced from its present
ceiling of 275 billion dollars
on July 1, 1958, by an
amount equal to 2% of the
net revenue of the United
States for fiscal year 1957.
The next year, effective
July 1, 1959, it would be
reduced by an amount
equal to 3% of the net rev-
enue for fiscal 1958. This
would continue until 5% is
reached, and thereafter
payment on the debt would
be 5% annually.
The bill would allow
three possible suspensions
of this orderly reduction: a
state of war, an economic
threat proclaimed by the
President, and a tax relief
measure which would re-
duce the revenue. In the
case of a tax reduction,
the amount of revenue lost
would not be applied to
debt reduction for a period
of not more than two years.
Sen. Saltonstall de-
scribes the purposes of the
plan as follows:
"1-To reduce the size
of the public debt and to
reduce the interest pay-
ments thereon; to create a
fiscal system which will
encourage and make pos-
sible a general tax reduc-
tion;
"2-To combat the infla-
tionary forces in our econ-
omy created by a large
public debt and uncon-
trolled Federal spending;
"3-To control the ex-
penditures of the Federal
government; i.e., assuming
that the debt limitation
and the annual debt re-
main approximately the
same, Federal spending in
any given year after this
bill takes full effect can-
not exceed an amount
equivalent to the revenue
receipts of that year less
an amount equivalent to
5% of the preceding year's
revenue, and
"4-To promote greater
economic stability to in-
sure that our nation is
fully prepared to meet the
threat of Communist ag-
gression; to reduce the debt
so as to provide an avail-
able reserve in the event
deficit spending is needed
once again to fight another
major war. Our economic
reserve and the stability
of our nation's economy
are essential to meet any
Communist threat, either
economic or military."
*
The device enables the
major objectives of debt
reduction, reduced spend-
ing and tax reduction to be
related one to the other.
This simple idea for
plain planned economy has
caught the interest of Con-
gress which, despite frus-
tration, is still anxious to
take something home which
expresses its good inten-
tions.
