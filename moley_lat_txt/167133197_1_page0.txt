RAYMOND MOLEY:
Why Larson Moved;
a Republican Joke
One of the more notable
bloopers by the White
House guard of honor,
which has conditioned
and prepared the Republi-
can Party for a difficult
1958, has been the inven-
tion of the term—it really
wasn't an idea—"modern
Republicanism."
In the first place, it
failed to impress a public
which distrusts and rejects
semantic traps. A slogan
is appropriate when
there is something behind
it. But "modern Republi-
canism" had no more
body to it than one of
those dickeys that used
to supply the appearance
but not the reality of a
shirt.
*
The phrase implied that
the President, after all,
spoke only for a single fac-
tion of the party. It also
told those regulars who,
even in years of defeat,
mustered more than 20,-
000,000 votes, that they
were seedy, useless and
expendable.
And, most important, it
provided a hunting license—
with at least the im-
plied approval of the Pres-
ident—for people like Paul
Hoffman, Stassen and oth-
ers to go forth attacking
other Republicans. For
this tendency of Republi-
cans to attack members of
their own party and to go
easy on the opposition is
an incurable habit.
*
In this atmosphere of
trigger-happy reform there
appeared in 1956 a volume
by one Arthur Larson, Un-
dersecretary of Labor, en-
titled "A Republican
Looks at His Party." No
one denied that Larson
had a right to look at the
Republican Party, for even
a cat may look at a king.
But there were many who
denied that Larson was a
legitimate Republican.
In any event, the boys
around the President made
much of this display of lit-
eracy, and "liberal" com-
mentators hailed Larson as
the most profound political
philosopher since Dr.
Townsend—and claimed a
niche in history for him
alongside such immortals
as Coin Harvey and Dan-
iel De Leon. But whereas
those departed reformers
had programs, however
crazy, a close examination
of the Larson book reveals
nothing except a miscel-
lany of egghead verbiage
in the manner of the late
Russell Davenport.
*
His chapter on labor, for
example, a subject on
which as Undersecretary
he should have had spe-
cific knowledge as well as
decipherable convictions,
is a semantic tap dance
through 35 pages in which
he skillfully avoided any
contact with the real prob-
lems with which that area
is thronged and which
confront labor, manage-
ment and government to-
day.
However, the aforemen-
tioned commentators at
once ascribed the Eisen-
hower philosophy, hither-
to unclear, to the Larson
arsenal, and Larson was
elevated to the high post
of spokesman for the
world to hear in the U.S.
Information Agency. As
spokesman for the world
to hear, however, he made
a speech in Hawaii in
which he said things
which made the Demo-
cratic Party angry. And
so, with the silent ap-
proval of every regular
Republican in the Senate,
the USIA budget was cut
by many millions of dol-
lars.
And now, as a new ses-
sion of Congress ap-
proaches, Larson has been
ousted from his post in
USIA and moved into the
already crowded White
House. The obvious reason
is that the administration
wants no further cuts in
the USIA budget on ac-
count of Larson.
*
Presumably his services
will now consist of pretty-
ing up the President's
speeches.
The cream of the jest is
that Larson's fall was not
because he offended Re-
publicans, but, because of
the unforgivable sin of at-
tacking the opposition.
That decision by the Presi-
dent epitomizes the true
spirit of "modern Repub-
licanism."
