CALIFORNIA
HALF GONE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a previous article I
noted that while the pub-
lic has been watching the
rivalries of California's
distinguished sons, Know-
land, Nixon and Knight,
the AFL-CIO Committee
on Political Education has
been concentrating its at-
tention on the election of
Congressmen and mem-
bers of the State Legisla-
ture. It has cut the Repub-
lican vote for members of
the House in eight years
from 59% to 46%, despite
two sweeps of the State by
a Republican candidate for
President.
Meanwhile, it has been
electing more and more
Democratic members to the
State Legislature. After
the election of 1952 there
were in the State Assembly
44 Republicans and 36
Democrats. There were 28
Republican Senators and
11 Democratic Senators.
However, after the election
of 1956 (in which Eisen-
hower-Nixon carried the
State by 500,000) there
were in the Assembly 42
Republicans and 38 Demo-
crats and in the Senate
each party has 20 mem-
bers.

It is not difficult to see
why there is such intense
interest on the part of the
national union in the Cali-
fornia Legislature. In the
first place, there are re-
curring threats of restric-
tive legislation such as a
right-to-work law. At all
costs this sort of limitation
must be prevented, be-
cause the union shop not
only is an enormous eco-
nomic advantage but it
gives the unions great
sums of captive money and
a multitude of disciplined
workers on election day.
The control of the Legis-
lature will give the AFL-
CIO's COPE another great
advantage after 1960.
Judging by the present
growth of the State's popu-
lation, the census of 1960
will show that the State
will be entitled to several
more members of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
It may increase the pres-
ent representation of 30 to
38.
The Legislature will draw
the lines of the new dis-
tricts, and by the ancient
art of gerrymandering can
create more Democratic,
COPE-controlled Congress-
men. Since California by
that time will be the sec-
ond State in political pow-
er, its transformation in-
to another Reuther duchy
will be significant.

The activity of COPE in
California provides a fas-
cinating picture of efficient,
practical politics. It is most
important to realize that
COPE is seeking the great-
est possible number of
members of Congress and
State Legislatures at the
smallest cost in money and
manpower. Hence, it is pos-
sible, by teaming up with
left-wing farm groups, pub-
lic power and co-operative
organizations, to win rural
or semirural seats.
The activity of the un-
ions has been especially
notable in the counties east
of the Sierras and in the
central part of the State.
All the counties that bor-
der on the east were, in
1956, Democratic in their
votes for the House.
There are also special
drives to gain specific seats.
For example, in 1954 the
unions concentrated on
defeating a Republican in
the Fresno area. They suc-
ceeded and have held the
seat since. Then, in 1956,
COPE concentrated on the
11th District, just north of
the Fresno area. This dis-
trict is primarily agricul-
tural but with growing ur-
ban areas.
★
COPE sent in workers to
get out all union members
for registration and the
primary. The drive was or-
ganized down to the small-
est detail. On election day
the cars rolled, the baby
sitters sat, the poll watch-
ers watched, and the tele-
phoners telephoned — and
lo! There is another Con-
gressman indebted to
COPE.
While people in the East
have considered Southern
California the center of
strange cults and crusades,
that area is, in fact, the
more conservative. It is in
the north, west, and center
of the State where the
greater progress has been
made by COPE. But the
south is under serious proc-
essing and will probably
show union gains in 1958.
