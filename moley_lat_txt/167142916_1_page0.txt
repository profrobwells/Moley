HALF THE U.S. IS MORTGAGED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When the President of
the United States and his
competent Secretary of the
Treasury admit that a pro-
posed budget is the best
they can make of the finan-
cial affairs of the govern-
ment and that they hope
Congress can make sense
out of it, we should be wary
of danger.
And when, after months
of hullabaloo and messing
around, Congress makes no
progress in the job of im-
provement, the fact should
be known to all that under
present conditions the
whole business is out of
control.
This fact has been evi-
dent to informed people for
some time, but nothing has
been done about it. The
first Hoover Commission
said as much eight years
ago. The second Hoover
Commission repeated the
warning two years ago.

Congress has been eager
to buy political advantage
by authorizing projects for
which there is no money to
execute. It has thus piled
up an immense mountain
of vague obligations. It has
also appropriated billions
that have not been spent.
Presidents, who are not
without blame, have had a
series of budget directors
who have not really di-
rected anything, while the
great office of the Comp-
troller General has not been
able to do much controlling.
Meanwhile, there has
been legislation more or
less in the dark.
Under a system which
uses the rather ambiguous
term "obligational author-
ity" there is no means of
reviewing annually all past
fiscal commitments. In ad-
dition to money appropri-
ated at the current session
of Congress, there are "un-
expended balances" greater
than the total amount re-
quested by the President
for the next fiscal year.
These come to a figure
somewhere between 70
billion and 80 billion dol-
lars. On the first of next
month, even with all pro-
spective economies de-
ducted, the executive
branch of the government
will have authority to
spend something like 140
billion dollars.
This staggering sum, ac-
cording to Sen. Byrd, is
probably almost equal to
"half the full assessed value
of all the land, all the
buildings, all the mines, all
the machinery, all the fac-
tories, all the livestock, ev-
erything of tangible value,
in the United States."
It is not only half of all
that the United States is
worth in dollars but the
complication is compound-
ed by the fact that, in addi-
tion to this mountainous
commitment, the govern-
ment owes its people 275
billion dollars.
That is not the whole
story. There are also 250
billion dollars in "contin-
gent" liabilities. These are
obligations which the gov-
ernment has guaranteed in
case they materialize, in-
cluding, Sen. Byrd reminds
us, 40 billion dollars in pos-
sible losses in public hous-
ing.
Consider, if you will, an
individual in a mess like
this. He owes more than
he owns. He has gone on
notes for friends for half
of what he owns. And he
is already making contracts
to spend another half of
what he owns. Such an in-
dividual would, if there
were any power over him,
either be denied any fur-
ther control or authority,
or be put in jail. For he
is not only bankrupt but he
makes out new checks and
piles up additional debts.

A partial corrective for
this dreadful condition was
recommended by the Hoo-
ver Commission and was
enacted by the Senate last
year. The House failed to
act.
A similar bill has again
been passed by the Senate.
It had the sponsorship of
48 members on both sides
of the aisle. It now goes
to the House. In another
article I shall outline the
nature of this proposed re-
form.
