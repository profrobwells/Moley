RAYMOND MOLEY:
Conservative Ouster
in Britain Unlikely
When Aneurin Bevan
visited us a few weeks ago,
he was widely billed as
"the next Foreign Minister
of Great Britain." This, of
course, gave him the free-
dom of public platforms
and audiences that he
could not otherwise have
enjoyed. And his behavior
hardly justified the interest
bestowed upon him. It
was, however, rashly and
prematurely assumed by
many Americans that the
Labor Party was on the
verge of forcing the Conservative
government's fall
and the calling of another
election which Labor was
sure to win.
*
A very considerable
change has taken place in
the state of British politics
since then. A recent
smashing by-election victory
for a Conservative
candidate merely reflected
what shrewd newspaper
observers saw as confusion
and weakness in the Labor
Party's Parliamentary
leadership. For a while it
was possible to exploit
the Macmillan government's
fumbling as the result of a
new Prime Minister's Suez
policy. But the Gaitskell
Labor leadership soon
demonstrated incapacity to
offer popular alternatives.
It then appeared that
Conservative losses in by-
elections had been more in
the nature of a protest
than an expression of confidence
in Labor. Generally, as
the London Economist
notes, the small vote at by-
elections for both parties
reflects the dullness of
British political life at the
moment, caused in no small
part by the dullness that
characterizes the leadership
in both parties.
Labor is not eager to
precipitate a general election
for several reasons. One is
that the Labor Party lacks a
real issue. Another is the
fact that Gaitskell and others
realize that by-elections are
not an infallible means of
predicting what will happen
in a general election. A general
election arouses the entire
country and brings out the
semi-indifferent vote. It
resolves itself in a series of
alternative propositions
quite unlike what may happen
when a single constituency
goes to the polls.
Another reason is that an
election costs the parties a
lot of money, and the trades
unions, which are the major
financial support of the Labor
Party, are not in any position
to indulge in spending money
to demonstrate very little of
direct interest to them.
*
Most important, however,
is the undeniable fact that
the Labor Party showed lamentable
weakness in its basic organization
in the election of 1955. At
the party conference which
followed its defeat, the chief
subject of concern was the
improvement of the grass roots
organization of the party. For
in the election of 1955 Conservatives
had almost exactly twice
the number of full-time
"constituency agents" that
Labor could afford. In fact,
the Labor Party was nonexistent
in many constituencies. This
grave deficiency has not yet
been corrected, and the party
is in no position to fight an
efficient and well-financed
Conservative organization.
For success in politics
depends as much, if not
more, on efficient organization
as on issues or candidates.
It may be more than two
years before we see another
general election in Britain.
Meanwhile, those who fear
Bevan at the helm of foreign
affairs there may rest quietly.
