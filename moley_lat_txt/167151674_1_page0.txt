'NYE' BEVAN'S NEWEST SONG
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Not since the wily,
loquacious, untruthful ego-
tist Harold Laski used to
charm pinkish college
groups have our eggheads
had the prospect of a finer
feast of Socialistic double
talk than during the cur-
rent visit to these shores
of Aneurin Bevan. It is
generally recognized that
Bevan, Minister of Health
and later Minister of Labor
in the disastrous British
experiment with Socialism
from 1945 to 1951, has an
ambition to be Foreign
Secretary if the Labor
Party attains power in the
next election.
For that reason, Bev-
an has become consider-
ably more circumspect in
his utterances and more
global in his interests.
Hence it will be eagerly
wished and ardently spo-
ken by our "liberals" that
this firebrand from Mon-
mouthshire (just over the
border from Wales) has
become an elder states-
man, with the mellowing
conservatism that becomes
age. He has the talent to
confirm this error in the
minds of many Americans
who think they are trudg-
ing along with President
Eisenhower in the middle
of the road. For no Brit-
ish statesman in our times
except Winston Church-
ill has had more capacity
to capture support by
clothing hard doctrine in
soft garments. Nor has
any member of the So-
cialist movement in Brit-
ain ever held so fervently
the fallacies of that faith.
His theme now will be
foreign affairs. In his tel-
evised interview last Sun-
day he indicated that he
had turned away from sal-
vation through Socialism
on the national level only
long enough to make peace
with the Soviet. And the
peace he proposes is as
complete a sellout as was
Neville Chamberlain's
"peace in our time" before
the great war. All Bevan
wants us to do is to quit
testing the bombs and to
embrace Communist China
as a member of the family
of nations. What could
there is no real compro-
mise with capitalistic soci-
ety in this man. His hatred
of British and American
political and economic tra-
ditions is very real and
utterly enduring.
In his confession of
faith, embodied in his
book "In Place of Fear,"
he tells of his reflections
when a young man work-
ing in the mines in South
Wales:
"My concern was with
one practical question,
where does power lie in
this particular state of
Great Britain, and how
can it be attained by the
workers? Individual
ambition was overlaid by
the social imperative.
Conflicting social forces
are in the main three: pri-
vate property, poverty and
democracy. Among them
no rest is possible."
Therefore, when Bevan
reached Parliament his
hatred of all that repre-
sented the traditions of
the nation welled up with-
in him. The first thing that
he said a new Member
must bear in mind was
that "these were not his
ancestors. His forebears
had no part in the past, the
accumulated dust of which
now muffles his own foot-
falls."
The destruction of pri-
vate property must be
through "collective spend-
ing." This means the same
thing as Marx and Engels
expressed as the need for
confiscatory income and
death taxes.
In my 1950 talk with
Bevan I asked what would
happen if a trade union
should attempt to strike in
a nationalized industry.
He said he would put the
leaders in jail and the
workers in the army.
Then I asked him what
American labor leaders he
admired. "John Lewis, the
Welshman, perhaps?"
"No," he answered,
"Lewis is a compromiser,
passe, outdated. The only
American labor leaders
worth their salt are the
Reuther brothers."
There is an old proverb:
"Beware of the horns of
the oxen, the heels of the
ass and the smiles of the
Saxon."
Bevan is not a Saxon.
But in his case we might
extend the warning a bit.
