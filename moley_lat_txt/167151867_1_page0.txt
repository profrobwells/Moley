NIXON'S DEFENSE OF THE BUDGET
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his speech before the
American Iron and Steel
Institute last week Vice-
President Nixon went all
out for the President's
budget.
In so doing he made full
use of the claim, so com-
mon in the President's de-
fenses of spending, that the
size of the appropriations
asked for fiscal 1958 is al-
most entirely due to the
fact that Congress has au-
thorized these programs in
the past and that there is
no alternative but to con-
tinue them. Specifically,
the Vice-President said on
this point:
★
"I suggest we examine
the reasons why the budg-
et is as large as it is . . .
The increased size of the
budget is not due to the
initiation of new, so-called
New Deal spending pro-
grams. If all the new pro-
grams which had not pre-
viously been approved in
the Congress were taken
out of the budget less than
$300,000,000 would be
saved. And the size of the
budget cannot be attribut-
ed to increases in foreign
aid. The amount requested
is actually $4,100,000,000
less in 1958 than in 1953."
Now, in judging this
statement, we have a duty
to remind ourselves that
this speech was not made
by a candidate for Alder-
man, casting his oratorical
bread at a casual crowd of
idle people on a street cor-
ner. Nor was it made by a
candidate for the House of
Representatives speaking
from the Courthouse steps.
This was a speech by a
man who occupies the office
of Vice-President of the
United States. It was made
to a responsible and impor-
tant group of business and
professional people who
are, in their own right,
versed and experienced in
financial affairs.
But it is a tricky state-
ment which is subject to
serious challenge on vital
points. Nor was this state-
ment made without ade-
quate information and
Vice-President Nixon
without full knowledge of
the true picture of what
this budget means. In
short, it is guile and not ig-
norance that characterizes
it, as I shall show.
The statement about for-
eign aid selects 1953 as a
comparison. Why did not
the Vice-President select
the estimate for 1957, which
was an Eisenhower year,
and compare it with 1958?
If that were done, it would
show a sizable increase in
1958 over 1957.
The statement about new
programs needs very care-
ful reading. The actual fact
is that the 1958 budget asks
for 24 new programs and
18 expanded programs. If
we take the total of the
sums asked to be appro-
priated for the 24 new pro-
grams, the sum is not "less
than $300,000,000," but
$625,000,000.
But note that the Vice-
President has shrewdly al-
lowed himself an out on
this point. For he says that
he is speaking of new pro-
grams "which had not pre-
viously been approved in
the Congress." This out, if
it be an out, means that
some of these matters have
been covered in earlier au-
thorizations by Congress,
but without any appropria-
tions by Congress. But
there is neither a moral nor
a legal obligation on the
President to recommend
appropriations for these
previous authorizations.
For example, there are al-
ways several hundred mil-
lions in past pork-barrel
authorizations that are ig-
nored both by the Presi-
dent and the head of the
Army engineers.
★
The fact is that with the
42 new and expanded pro-
grams recommended of his
own free will by the Presi-
dent in his budget, approv-
al of the budget will mean
spending 2 billion dollars
more in 1958 and 9 billion
dollars altogether.
This is the true meaning
of the "new program" situ-
ation. It is not in keeping
with the high office held by
Mr. Nixon to offer a dis-
torted and deceptive expla-
nation of the situation. If he
is going to be responsible
for the President's budget,
he should act in a responsi-
ble manner.
