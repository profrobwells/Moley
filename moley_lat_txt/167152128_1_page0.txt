A BUDGET
SHOCK
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For the purpose of indis-
creet publication in the
press, the news is being
discreetly leaked by ad-
ministration sources in
Washington that the Presi-
dent is really bound by
past legislation enacted by
Congress to include in his
budget almost all of the re-
quests made by him this
year. Moreover, according
to this leaked report, the
Budget Bureau is compil-
ing a list of these obliga-
tions, and when it is pub-
lished the public will be
shocked to learn that it is
Congress, and not the Pres-
ident, that is responsible
for the swollen estimates
for 1958.

There is nothing espe-
cially shocking about this
aspect of the present battle
of the budget. The Byrd
Joint Committee on the Re-
duction of Nonessential
Federal Expenditures has
such a study under way
and will in due time report
its findings. The Budget
Director is a member of
that committee, as is Treas-
ury Secretary Humphrey.
The shocking thing
about this so-called sensa-
tional report is that the
Budget Bureau should
need to make an elaborate
study to find such obliga-
tory spending items. It
ought to have such infor-
mation ready at hand at all
times.
Moreover, the impression
being given that the Presi-
dent's hands have been vir-
tually tied by past legisla-
tion of Congress is utterly
without foundation.
Let us start with an ex-
planation of what a Con-
gressional authorization
really is. It is an enactment
by Congress that sets forth
plans for an expenditure
for which money is to be
appropriated at some fu-
ture time. It is, as former
Interior Secretary McKay
put it, a "hunting license
for an appropriation."
In law or morals, an au-
thorization has no binding
force on the President un-
less it establishes a con-
tractual obligation on the
part of the Federal govern-
ment with a State or an
individual.
*
There are such certain
continuing obligations for
which money should be ap-
propriated every year, and
there are also appropria-
tions which are not limited
to a single year. There are
also a few obligations not
included in the President's
budget at all.
As an example of such
continuing obligations,
there is the authority giv-
en to the Commodity Credit
Corporation to draw upon
the Treasury. There are
also certain programs un-
der which farmers may get
loans, etc.
However, such compul-
sory obligations are not de-
signed to become auto-
matic. Nearly every one
should be reviewed annu-
ally, and if there is no
longer, in the opinion of
the President, any need for
such an expenditure he
should not make a request
for it.
*
The whole basic princi-
ple of responsible govern-
ment is that its financial
affairs should come under
review at orderly periods,
presumably every year. To
shirk this responsibility is
a very serious matter. And
it should be the function of
the Budget Director to ad-
vise the President of his
duty annually.
A study of these so-called
obligations to spend would,
I believe, reveal that most
of them are not at all bind-
ing in morals or law upon
the President. His budget
is a President's budget. He
and he alone is responsible
for it. The effort to pass
the responsibility to Con-
gress for the size of this
budget has no justification.
The real situation is that,
due to the huge unexpend-
ed balances, amounting to
more than 70 billion dol-
lars, and the loose manner
in which many appropria-
tions have been made, Con-
gress is almost helpless to
influence, to any important
degree, the amount of ex-
penditures in any given
year. It is the President,
not Congress, who is hold-
ing the trump cards in the
spending game.
Therefore, it would be
well to take the rumors of
shocking news to come
with a grain of salt. The
"shock" was administered
last January when a Presi-
dent pledged to economy
submitted this budget to
Congress.
