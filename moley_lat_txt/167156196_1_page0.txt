FIGHT FOR
THE ATOM
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A bitter fight in Con-
gress is likely over the de-
velopment of atomic power
plants by the government
under some such legisla-
tion as was placed before
the last session under the
names of Sen. Albert Gore
and Rep. Chet Holifield.
The argument for this
sort of emergency opera-
tion will be that the Rus-
sian scientific achieve-
ments, plus the alleged
slow rate of private con-
struction, make such a
government monopoly
necessary. Meanwhile,
heartening progress is be-
ing made by private com-
panies in their construc-
tions now under way and
in their plans for the fu-
ture.

A big meeting was held
for three days early in De-
cember with officials of the
Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, attended by a very
considerable number of
representatives of private
and public power organiza-
tions which are interested
in nuclear power develop-
ment, and also by repre-
sentatives of the big manu-
facturing companies in
that field.
A signal step was cele-
brated in private develop-
ment in November at the
dedication of the Vallecitos
atomic power plant, built
by General Electric for the
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
This was a historic event,
for it was the first atomic
power plant in the United
States built entirely by pri-
vate capital.
Speaking on that occa-
sion, Lewis L. Strauss,
chairman of the AEC, said:
"This plant and the elec-
tricity flowing from it to
the homes and industries
in 47 California counties is
a symbol of the atomic fu-
ture—and not a far-distant
future—when larger and
more advanced nuclear
power plants will be in op-
eration up and down and
across our nation, pat-
terned after this and other
promising reactor con-
cepts.
*
"That future is no mere
dream or fantasy. We are
already on the threshold,
witnessing its beginning.
There is rising impressive-
ly now, on a site some 45
miles southwest of Chica-
go, the massive steel and
concrete foundations of a
nuclear power plant for
which this reactor serves
as the pilot plant, provid-
ing design and operating
data.
"That full-scale Com-
monwealth Edison plant in
Illinois, with an electrical
output 35 or 40 times the
capacity of this develop-
ment plant, is one of some
18 or 20 nuclear power
plants which we expect to
see in operation in the
United States by the mid
1960s, representing a total
investment of close to a
billion dollars with a large
part of that sum to be sup-
plied by industry itself. In
fact, planning or negotia-
tion has already been an-
nounced for six other large
plants which—like Com-
monwealth Edison's Dres-
den plant—will be fi-
nanced entirely by private
capital."

It is true that the kilo-
watt capacity of the Valle-
citos project is not large.
But it is a pilot operation
which will yield valuable
knowledge for other larger
projects already planned or
started. The point is that
the United States has time
to experiment with many
kinds of reactors and, in
considerable part, with pri-
vate money. For our need
of this sort of electric ener-
gy is not immediate. Our
supply of coal, oil and fall-
ing water is adequate for
two or more decades to
come. And while the cost
per kilowatt of power de-
veloped by present reac-
tors is prohibitive except
on an experimental basis
now, there can be and will
be means of reducing that
unit cost in those precious
years to come.
However, any attempt at
a crash program by the
government would not
only be excessively expen-
sive to the taxpayer, but
would threaten private
companies with a crushing
government monopoly.
Thus, any such program as
is in the minds of public-
power-minded members of
Congress might well delay
rather than accelerate the
progress which should be
achieved in 1970 and after.
