A WORTHY
DRIVE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
An item in the news last
week stirred a measure of
hope in the minds of 300,-
000 sufferers from multiple
sclerosis and their relatives
and friends. A new discov-
ery in research, however,
should not establish any as-
sumption that the mystery
of what cripples and kills
so many every year has
been solved. The best that
in honesty can be said is
that the solution may be
somewhat closer to attain-
ment.
The disease itself, as
more and more Americans
are learning, is basically a
deterioration of myelin,
which is the substance
coating and, in a sense, in-
sulating the nerve fibers
of the body.
The cause of the deterior-
ation of the myelin is un-
known, although scientists
are working on many hy-
potheses.
Miss Rose Ichelson, a
scientist working in St.
Luke's Hospital in Phila-
delphia, has been working
for some years on an effort
to isolate and culture
something called spiro-
chetal organisms from the
spinal fluid of patients suf-
fering from MS, as it is
commonly known. Miss
Ichelson reports that in a
study of the spinal fluids of
76 cases she obtained a
positive culture of the or-
ganisms in 59 of the cases.

The society also an-
nounces this year the fact
that another hopeful bit
of information has been
found. It has been deter-
mined that the myelin,
which is the center of con-
cern, is produced by what
is known as the glial cell.
This, of course, directs at-
tention to the search for
possible interruptions in
the production of the sub-
stance which may cause
the subsequent deteriora-
tion.
Above all, the society,
which is conducting its an-
nual drive for funds, em-
phasizes that many scien-
tists must be employed in
many fields of inquiry be-
fore this deadly enemy of
people in the prime of life
(mostly between 30 and
45) can ever be understood
and exposed to efforts to
find a cure.
Ten years ago the dis-
ease was hardly recognized
at all except among scien-
tists. Now it is coming to
be known as a major hu-
man concern. Contribu-
tions may be made to the
National Multiple Sclerosis
Society at 257 Fourth Ave.,
New York, N.Y., or to any
one of the society's 100
chapters in cities through-
out the nation.
