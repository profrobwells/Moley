RAYMOND MOLEY:
Reversing the Trend
of Federal Power
Once more the President
has returned to the homely
truth that centralized gov-
ernment is the enemy of
human liberty. He never
has phrased it so well as in
his speech to the State Gov-
ernors at Williamsburg.
His conclusion was that
the dark underground of
Eastern Europe should
give us "renewed determi-
nation to hew to the prin-
ciple of the diffusion of
power, knowing that only
thus will we ourselves for-
ever avoid drifting irre-
trievably into the grasp of
some form of centralized
government."
The fatal trend in this
country toward centraliza-
tion in the Federal govern-
ment the President believes
to be largely due to the in-
action of the States in the
face of some "undeniable
needs," plus, in some in-
stances, such as housing,
the swarming to Washing-
ton of Mayors and other
municipal people asking
for Federal help.
All this is true. But his
interpretation of who is
the judge of "undeniable
needs" is open to some
question.
*
In the case of school con-
struction, which he cites
as an example of such
need, he has accepted the
interpretation of pressure
groups of professional ed-
ucators, such as the Na-
tional Education Associa-
tion. This is despite the
denial that Federal aid is
needed, not only by the
Governors of many of the
States, but by the task
force of his own Commis-
sion on Intergovernmental
Relations and by his own
White House Conference
on Education.
The President suggests
that a practical means of
stopping the Federal gov-
ernment's war of occupa-
tion against the States
should be the creation of a
committee of representa-
tives of the States and Fed-
eral government. This
committee should specify
activities that should be
returned to the States and
also the tax sources now
taken over by the Feder-
al government which
should be returned to the
States.
There is, however, plen-
ty of information already
assembled which might be
acted upon by the Presi-
dent and the leadership of
Congress, with or without
such a committee. There is
the report of the Presi-
dent's own Commission of
Intergovernmental Rela-
tions with its various task-
force researches. There are
the reports of the two
Hoover commissions, also
with task-force contribu-
tions of great value.
*
Notable among these
was a report in 1949 by a
task force headed by T.
Jefferson Coolidge on ex-
actly the point made by
the President at Williams-
burg. The magnificent re-
port by Adm. Ben Moreell's
group on water resources
in 1955 was studied by a
Cabinet committee ap-
pointed by the President.
The Cabinet committee
submitted an excellent re-
port.
There was also a monu-
mental study by the Na-
tional Association of
Manufacturers which spec-
ified many activities
which might be taken over
by the States, and the tax
sources, seized by the Fed-
eral government, which if
returned might enable the
States to do their jobs.
All these masses of infor-
mation have been gather-
ing dust for years.
*
There are those who have
suggested that instead of
initiating new Federal in-
vasions of the States, the
administration and the
responsible leaders of Con-
gress might have made
some use of these plans for
decentralizing government
before this. These critics
see in the new committee
only the vision of new de-
lays and new reports to
gather the dust of years to
come.
What is needed, they
say, is the will to stand up
against some of the pres-
sure groups that infest
Washington and the gov-
ernment bureaucrats who
are allied with them, and
to start cutting back Fed-
eral activities. There is
plenty of knowledge. What
is needed is the will to do.
