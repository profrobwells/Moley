'INDISPENSABLE' ITEM
IN THE BUDGET
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the President's sharp
criticism of the efforts of
Congress to cut his budget,
he seemed to say that "pro-
grams" once established
are untouchable.
This ignores the fact
that under his administra-
tion a number of commis-
sions and committees have
been appointed to review
such "programs." The most
notable of these was the
second Hoover Commis-
sion, which submitted its
report in June, 1955.
A major item in that re-
port was its analysis and
recommendations concern-
ing water resources and
power. The engineer who
was employed by the Hoo-
ver task force on that sub-
ject was Charles D. Cur-
ran. Last month, in a com-
prehensive review of the
Federal programs on water
resources, Curran pointed
out that after 19 months
not a single recommenda-
tion of the commission or
the task force in the field
had been adopted, either
by the administration or by
Congress.
Meanwhile, the Presi-
dent's own Cabinet advi-
sory committee on water
resources policy, estab-
lished for the express pur-
pose of reviewing the rec-
ommendations of the Hoo-
ver report, has made sev-
eral very constructive
recommendations. That
committee, too, has been
ignored.
Are we still to regard as
"fatuous" all those who
suggest that occasionally
the administration should
stop, look, and listen?
★
Even the specifications
of some of the authoriza-
tions of programs have
been ignored, and, despite
that, the President's budget
calls for full steam ahead.
Consider, for example,
the gigantic Upper Colora-
do River Storage Project
which was jammed through
last year by the White
House.
The bill that was passed
was obviously a half-baked
affair because many of the
items in the project had
not been investigated.
The bill provided that a
thorough financial analysis
should be made before work
should start. No such anal-
ysis has been made, al-
though the increased cost
of interest and of materials
obviously would now knock
the roof off any past esti-
mate.
The largest single item
in the Upper Colorado
Project is the proposed
Glen Canyon Dam. The
argument for this was that
it is essential for the stor-
age of water. However, the
conditions in the Colorado
River indicate quite clearly
that storage capacity is not
needed at all. It should be
noted that the Glen Canyon
Dam would be largely a
duplication of the Hoover
Dam and reservoir down-
stream. But Lake Mead,
the storage reservoir above
Hoover Dam, is now about
one-third full. In fact, it
offers unused storage ca-
pacity for all time to come.
And if Glen Canyon is built,
Lake Mead will never have
a full supply of water.

There have always been
engineering doubts about
the Glen Canyon Dam proj-
ect. For a long time the
walls of the canyon were
of questionable strength to
hold a 700-foot dam. Ap-
parently the Bureau of
Reclamation satisfied itself
that it would be safe. But
the present plans call for a
dam of much less massive
proportions than the Hoo-
ver Dam, which raises seri-
ous question whether it
could hold a full load of
water.
But the real purpose of
the Glen Canyon Dam was
to be the development of
hydroelectric power. This,
in turn, was to provide
revenues with which to
pay for several irrigation
projects. The cost of ir-
rigating the land in ques-
tion would be vastly more
than the production of the
land would justify. The cost
of irrigating this land has
been variously estimated,
but the conservative figure
placed upon it by Curran
is $1500 per acre.

Meanwhile, the valley of
the Colorado is producing
enough uranium to provide
ultimately many times the
amount of energy that is
needed in the region. This
suggests that Glen Canyon
may be a $500,000,000
monument to the foibles
and fallacies of politics.
But an "indispensable"
item in the 1958 budget is
$25,000,000 for construction
on the Upper Colorado
Project.
