RAYMOND MOLEY:
Another Roosevelt
Stirring Up Trouble
For the very important
reason that it highlights
the problem facing the Re-
publican Party over the
nation, I shall devote this
and a succeeding piece to
an intraparty Republican
fight now going on in New
York City.
Largely because of his
name, a central figure in
this squabble is John
Roosevelt, youngest son of
F. D. R. and a Republican
of some years' standing.
There is, of course, noth-
ing new about a Roosevelt
raising Cain with a regu-
lar party organization in
New York.
Back in the 1880s, when
Theodore Roosevelt was in
the State Assembly, he was
conspicuous by his politi-
cal irregularity. Later, in
the reform administration
of Mayor William L.
Strong, he was a scourge
to the city organization,
which had been content
for many years to play
second fiddle to Tammany.
Still later, he played a
high hand with Bosses
Platt and Barnes.
â˜…
Even after the crafty
Platt thought he had per-
manently deposited the
troublesome Teddy in the
Vice-Presidency, the death
of President McKinley
started the trouble all over
again. It was an on-and-off
affair between T. R. and
New York Republicanism
over most of his years.
Sometimes, when it suited
his interests, he was as
regular as the next one,
but at other times he was
able to cause great worries
to his party's leadership.
Cousin Franklin D. hit
the headlines first with
his opposition to Tam-
many, and it was a sullen
organization which, under
the lash of Alfred E. Smith,
accepted him as its candi-
date for Governor. He was
never popular with Tam-
many, which is technically
the organization in New
York County, or, in New
York City terms, the Bor-
ough of Manhattan.
For a short time after
the death of F. D. R., his
son, Franklin Jr., aspired
to the Governorship and,
as a beginning, became a
Congressman from Man-
hattan. But in the final
test, in 1954, the organiza-
tion saw to it that Frank-
lin Jr. was sidetracked in
favor of W. Averell Harri-
man. As a candidate for
Attorney General that
year, he was the sole cas-
ualty among the candi-
dates for State office, and
it is no secret that organ-
ization Democrats had a
hand in extinguishing a
career that might have
caused trouble for them.
And now there appears
another Roosevelt, the Re-
publican John, who for-
sook the party of his fa-
ther. In the two Eisenhow-
er campaigns the Republi-
can National Committee
and the White House polit-
ical masterminds, happy
to snatch this brand from
burning democracy, made
John's part in those cam-
paigns prominent and ef-
fective. Now, however,
they must realize that they
have created a source of
pain and suffering in the
regular Republican organ-
ization in New York.

Earlier this year, John
Roosevelt sought to estab-
lish a Republican club
which was to be the center
around which young and
"modern" Republicans
were to gather in an effort
to take over the party in
New York County. This
was frustrated by court ac-
tion by Thomas J. Curran,
county chairman.
Curran is a conservative
Republican who loyally
and effectively helped
Thomas E. Dewey attain
the Governorship three
times. He served Dewey
in the office of Secretary
of State, a sinecure which,
beginning with the admin-
istration of Franklin D.
Roosevelt as Governor,
had been assigned to an
outstanding political lead-
er of the Governor's party.
At the moment the office
is filled by Carmine de
Sapio, Tammany boss.
*
Curran has no trouble
in holding his chairman-
ship because the county
district leaders are at-
tached to him by ties both
personal and political. He
is a conservative who
might have been a Taft Re-
publican had there been
no Dewey involved. So, in-
deed, are most of the lead-
ers under him.
This intraparty fight is
exactly what Tammany
loves. It has prospered for
many years on this sort of
Republican discord. In an-
other piece I shall outline
what Tammany is doing
about it. And thereby will
hang one of the oldest
truths in politics, a truth
which seems to elude Re-
publicans, especially mod-
ern Republicans.
