When, in early July,
1955, the news of Senate
Leader Lyndon Johnson's
heart attack appeared,
the most formidable can-
didate that the Democratic
Party could nominate in
1956 was removed.
I still believe that if po-
litical logic were to pre-
vail, this able and experi-
enced Texan would be the
man most likely to suc-
ceed for the Democrats in
1960. But nature has its
ruthless way with political
availables, and no doubt
the Johnson heart will be
a lasting bar to the ulti-
mate pinnacle of a states-
man.
This is especially true
after the medical history
of Presidents Roosevelt
and Eisenhower has
taught the electorate that
Presidential mental en-
dowments and experience
must be fortified by a
rugged constitution.
It is true that two other
Democratic hopefuls, Sens.
Kennedy and Symington,
will be subjected to a rigid
consideration of their
state of recovery from
serious illnesses before a
national convention will
dare nominate one of
them.

For the moment, how-
ever, Sen. Johnson is
vigorously directing the
destinies of his party in
the Senate and, to a de-
gree, in Congress general-
ly and stands as close to
being the opposition lead-
er as anyone in his party.
His advantage in being
a bond of unity in an oth-
erwise divided Democratic
Party comes not only from
his fortunate Texas con-
stituency but from his
somewhat moderate ideo-
logical status.
For Texans are quick to
say that they are as much
midwestern as southern.
The longitude of Austin is
not far from that of Lin-
coln, Neb., or Kansas City.
Political considerations
must also note the vast
number of former Texans
in the pivotal State of Cali-
fornia.
Compared with Demo-
cratic colleagues such as
Morse, Douglas and Hum-
phrey, the voting of
Johnson is somewhat to-
ward the moderate side.
"Moderate," however, can
hardly be attributed to the
Johnson who, in late 1955,
proclaimed a comprehen-
sive program for his party
in the election year ahead.
There were 13 points in
that schedule, 10 of which
involved Federal finances.
Of these, one had to do
with tax reduction, and
nine involved heavier Fed-
eral expenditures. His
formula for reduced taxes
would have benefited only
the low-income group,
which was a familiar vote-
catching device of Demo-
cratic leaders at that time.
But since the remaining
nine would have required
higher taxes for someone,
the entire program was
bound to be inflationary.
Johnson at that time
would have met increased
highway expenditures
from general taxation
rather than from the road
program itself. He would
have increased Social Se-
curity payments by low-
ering the age limit for
women, presumably from
the Social Security trust
funds. Both of these would
have to fall on the taxpay-
er eventually.
The remaining seven
points were medical re-
search and hospital con-
struction, 90% parity,
more money for housing,
a large water resources
program, including Hells
Canyon and Passamaquod-
dy, special relief for de-
pressed areas, and disaster
insurance.
This program seemed to
be a part of the philosophy
of the earlier Johnson who
was, as a member of the
House, an ardent Roose-
veltian.
Today his attention is
directed at the alleged de-
ficiencies of the Eisen-
hower defense program,
with a strong implication
that more should be spent
than the administration
will recommend.
Perhaps as a party lead-
er it is to be expected
his course follow the
waves of public opinion.
But when all the factors
are considered, he stands
well to the left of even the
more "liberal" Eisenhower
supporters.
However, even with this
plain sympathy for spend-
ing programs, he is not
without serious opposition
in his home State. There
is a gathering power,
largely created by labor
elements in Texas, which
is opposed to him. This is
mainly embodied in what
is called Democrats of
Texas, a group which is
not a specific part of the
Democratic Party but
which threatens to take
over the party in the near
future.
The new Sen. Yarbor-
ough is the embodiment
of this liberalism, and his
re-election will be a test
of its strength.
Thus, despite his logical
position as a leader in his
party nationally, Johnson
is without secure footing
in his State. This, even
more than his physical
problem, may doom any
ambition he may have for
higher office.
