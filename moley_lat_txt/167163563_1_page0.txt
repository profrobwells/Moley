RAYMOND MOLEY:
Wisconsin Factions---
an Election Autopsy
Someone with an eye to
the baseball news remarked
after hearing of the sur-
prise election of a Demo-
crat to the U.S. Senate in
Wisconsin that the Dairy
State is "the land of the
free and the home of the
Braves."
No State has been more
independent and selective
in its political decisions.
The record shows no fail-
ure to keep up with the
political times. Indeed, in
many respects its history
since the turn of the cen-
tury has shown an extraor-
dinary capacity for political
innovations, some good and
some bad.
*
It is, to use an expres-
sion with some currency
these days, modern Repub-
lican, but it insists upon
its own interpretation of
the meaning of "modern."
After hearing a number
of opinions from people in
Wisconsin who know their
politics I venture to sug-
gest a number of factors
which materially contribut-
ed to the election of Wil-
liam E. Proxmire, a Demo-
crat, over Walter J. Kohler,
modern Republican. The
order in which I list these
has no bearing on their rei-
ative importance:
The wounds opened in
Republican ranks by the
bitter fight last year be-
tween Sen. Alexander Wi-
ley and Glenn R. Davis,
now an ex-Congressman.
Tremendous affection
among people in all walks
of life for the late Sen. Mc-
Carthy, who would prob-
ably have been re-elected
in 1958.
The effort to run Koh-
ler's campaign by the Cit-
izens for Eisenhower group
-a group cordially detest-
ed by regular Republican
leaders.
*
Kohler's utter depend-
ence upon the popularity of
President Eisenhower â€” a
popularity which has con-
siderably ebbed in Wiscon-
sin since last year.
Unhappiness among reg-
ular Republicans with the
new Governor, Verne
Thompson, who has, espe-
cially with respect to the
sales tax issue, won the re-
sentment of advocates of
that measure.
The rapid ebbing of for-
mer Gov. Kohler's popu-
larity because he gave his
support to Sen. Wiley
last year. Also the feeling
among those who have
sympathized with Indus-
trialist Herbert Kohler's
long and courageous fight
against Reuther's UAW
that his kinsman Walter
Kohler as Governor failed
to take a stronger hand in
the disorders attending the
Kohler strike.
All of these factors would
tend to keep the Republi-
can vote low. And in fact
it was low. Kohler had con-
siderably fewer votes than
were cast for the Republi-
can candidates at the pri-
mary. This means that
many Republicans sat it
out and possibly that some
Republicans voted for
Proxmire.
The net of it all was that
little organized effort was
made to get out the Re-
publican vote; while many
would not have voted even
if there had been activity
by the Republican organ-
izations.
*
Against this stay-at-home
and disaffected Republican
vote the Democratic candi-
date had the powerful get-
out-the-vote machine of the
AFL-CIO Committee on Po-
litical Education. Proxmire
was reluctantly accepted as
a candidate by the union
politicians. But once he was
nominated, the smooth
operation of the COPE
brought out thousands of
union members and their
wives. It is interesting to
note that this turnout of
the union vote was espe-
cially notable in the small-
er industrial cities rather
than in Milwaukee. That
of course is the essential
strategy of COPE. It strikes
most heavily not in the
big industrial areas where
it might be expected to be
strongest but in smaller
places and even in semi-
rural districts.
Nothing in this election
can be taken to indicate
that there will be anything
of the same nature in 1958.
It may well be that organ-
ization Republicans, luke-
warm this year, will be out
in force to elect Davis or
some other conservative
Republican in 1958.
