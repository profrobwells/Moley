RAYMOND MOLEY:
President's Disability
in the Wilson Era
The nation has now been
reminded for the third time
in two years that it lives
in a fool's paradise. There
has been no clear determi-
nation of what should be
done if a President finds
himself unable to perform
the duties of his office.
For years the matter has
been a subject of ivory-
tower speculation. Many
proposals have been made
and have gone nowhere.
Only a few who have pon-
dered the lessons of history
and who possess not only
a keen imagination con-
cerning what might happen
but a profound sense of re-
sponsibility for their coun-
try's welfare have con-
cerned themselves with the
problem.
The lessons of experience
are sufficiently recent to be
vivid, not to say unpleasant
memories for many adult
Americans.
The first instance of a
crisis in our time had to do
with the incapacity of
President Wilson. History
has been tender with that
situation, but at this late
date, with most of the ma-
jor figures concerned in
their graves, the facts can
be faced.
*
From the time when
President Wilson had his
second and more severe at-
tack in October, 1919, he
was incapacitated. There
was not only the deadly
thrombosis but also intes-
tinal disorders. At times
he was in a coma. Occa-
sionally he could dictate a
few minutes but, accord-
ing to his personal stenog-
rapher, never for more
than five minutes at a time.
There can be differences
of opinior about the qual-
ity of his judgment and
mental coherence but there
is no doubt that great emo-
tional instability prevailed.
No other than Franklin D.
Roosevelt told me that
when he and James M. Cox
called upon Wilson after
they were nominated for
President and Vice-Presi-
dent in 1920 his sole re-
sponse to their pledge of
support for the League of
Nations was to say "Thank
you, gentlemen," and to
burst into tears.
John M. Blum in his
book, "Joe Tumulty and the
Wilson Era," quotes the
following from an article
written by Dr. Walter C.
Alvarez (in the journal
"Geriatrics," I, 189-216)
which gives special atten-
tion to the illness of Wil-
son:
"One of the commonest
ways of dying is to take 10
or 20 years to peter out
with cerebral arterioscle-
rosis and occasional epi-
sodes of thrombosis of a
small intracranial artery
the first episodes can
come on in the 40s, or even
in the 30s...some become
somewhat psychopathic...
some fall unconscious.
Some are overly emotion-
al."
From October, 1918, to
the end of Wilson's term
on March 4, 1921, Presiden-
tial power was held by Mrs.
Wilson, Dr. Grayson and
one or two intimates who
were not in official posi-
tions. Even the faithful
Tumulty was shut out. He
was compelled to communi-
cate through Mrs. Wilson.
The entire Cabinet and the
Vice-President were out-
side the bedside curtain.
Congress was not told the
truth, and only such vague
but optimistic bulletins as
Dr. Grayson. chose to give
out were issued by Tumul-
ty.
*
The Vice-President and
the members of the Cabinet
were kept in the dark
about the President's con-
dition but were too loyal to
the President to act. And
so the ghastly business of
government by a head of
state who was utterly in-
capacitated went on for 18
months.
It was the danger of that
sort of thing happening in
the midst of a great war
that caused a great many
people to have the urge to
speak out, after seeing
President Roosevelt, in the
campaign of 1944. But any
warning would have been
regarded and stigmatized
by the people around the
President as dirty politics.
And only the size of the
stroke that came to Roose-
velt in April, 1945, saved
the nation from another re-
gency, perhaps in this case
Mrs. Roosevelt, Harry Hop-
kins and the President's
personal physician. And
this grim business might
have gone on for nearly
four years.
Isn't it about time that
something was done to pre-
vent such a situation in the
future?
And in considering what
should be done, note that
the only plan at present by
the administration is the
Attorney General's scheme
for a constitutional amend-
ment to permit the Vice-
President and the Cabinet
to make the judgment. This,
of course, is nonsense, as
the Wilson experience
proves. For these people
are the President's people
and if a President has peo-
ple around him who, like
those around Wilson, will
not relinquish the reins of
office, the Vice-President
and the Cabinet would be
powerless to act.
