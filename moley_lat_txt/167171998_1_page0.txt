MEETING IN ST. LOUIS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
We see by the papers
that Sherman Adams,
White House Pooh-Bah, is
going to St. Louis for a Re-
publican fund-raising din-
ner. Anyone who can be
cozened into giving to the
party under such solicita-
tion will indeed be a stal-
wart, never-say-die Repub-
lican. Certainly, Adams is
the last man who should
be cast in such a role.
What is happening un-
der his leadership in
Washington, according to
information known to ev-
ery correspondent in that
city, will make sure that
this Republican, admin-
istration will present to
the opposition almost ev-
ery opportunity that can
be conceived to score
heavily during the coming
sessions of Congress and
to sweep the elections next
fall.
★
With faltering and con-
fused executive leadership
there will be no one to
bring pressure on Con-
gress to enact essential
legislation, no one to speak
with authority to the coun-
try on the merits of such
legislation, and no one to
bring firmly to a satisfac-
tory solution the many
conflicts and overlappings
in the executive depart-
ments, especially in the
Department of Defense.
But it is reported that
Adams intends in his
speech to press for legisla-
tion to permit some body
or bodies to determine
when a President is dis-
abled and when the Vice-
President should take over
the powers and duties of
the office.
★
The plan favored by the
administration and proba-
bly formulated by the po-
litically minded former
Atty. Gen. Brownell, is to
permit the Cabinet to be
the judge of that matter
when the President him-
self is unable to make such
a determination. This is
absurd. For the Cabinet
is the creature of the Pres-
ident and even in the total
disability of President Wil-
son the Cabinet members
were not only unable to
make any such determina-
tion but were blocked from
seeing the President by
Mrs. Wilson and Dr. Gray-
son.
★
Moreover, such a plan
neglects the essential pro-
cedural tradition in juris-
prudence and public law
—that when such a grave
decision is to be made con-
cerning the functions of a
public official or even of a
private individual, two
steps are in order and two
agencies are to be con-
cerned. The one is an
agency to bring the claim
or charge; the other and
entirely different one, to
make the judgment. In im-
peachment the House
brings the charge; the Sen-
ate makes the judgment.
Generally, in declaring a
private person incapacitat-
ed, members of his family
make the charge, but a
judge makes the decision.
It is, however, futile to
discuss methods here be-
cause there is small chance
that Congress under its
present leadership will
take any action, especially
in the present emergency.
Speaker Sam Rayburn is
quoted by a responsible
reporter as saying:
“We’ve gotten along for
168 years and I don’t think
many bad things have hap-
pened.”
★
The fact that the second
in the line of Presidential
succession could utter
such a ridiculous state-
ment is in itself frighten-
ing. We have now had
four “bad things” happen
—to Wilson, to Roosevelt
and two to Eisenhower.
How many more can this
country stand?
But there is no prospect
that Congress will take
any definitive action, since
the Democrats stand to
gain so much through a
Sherman Adams regency.
The only hope I can see
is that the President him-
self will break through the
censorship of his palace
guard and learn how deep-
ly the country is disturbed.
True admirers of the
President, and there are
millions of them, must
wish that he would take
such a course and delegate
all, not a part of the pow-
ers and duties of his office
to the Vice-President.
★
It is shocking to read,
however, a report by the
White House Boswell,
Robert J. Donovan of the
New York Herald Tribune,
who says that the Presi-
dent will go to the NATO
meeting in Paris as a test
of his capacity to carry
on. This can mean only
that if the stress and strain
of such a critical interna-
tional conference fails to
bring another and more
terrible physical break, he
will return and face the
immense burdens of the
coming months as a full-
time President.
Can it be possible that
these doctors, any doctors,
would permit any such in-
vitation to death—assum-
ing, of course, that they
can control the President’s
action?
