RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Modern Voltaire
in Bankruptcy Court
It is a matter of front-
page news in Cleveland
and elsewhere in Ohio that
Judge Carl D. Friebolin,
Federal referee in bank-
ruptcy in the northern dis-
trict of Ohio, eastern di-
vision, has reached the age
of 80. This sort of man
should be news every-
where, for within the
ranges of his calm philoso-
phy of life, public and pri-
vate, and under the sharp
lens of his perception, the
world around all of us
might take on more agree-
able and less pretentious
meaning.
Long ago he made his
choice against a political
career, which with his tal-
ents would have been of
high public note. Perhaps
he would say that he drift-
ed from law into a State
judgeship from which he
escaped and became ref-
eree in bankruptcy under
a judge long since gathered
to his fathers.
There he has remained
these 42 years reviewing
the material tragedies of
his district through wars,
booms and depressions.
The flare of prosperity may
blind us to the fact that
piping times may come
and go but failures never
falter. In the past 10 years
bankruptcies have in-
creased 370%.

Americans-imaginative,
energetic, resourceful
Americans persistently
gamble with their material
means. Since the flush days
of the 20s they have flut-
tered toward the light of
more luxury at easy pay-
ments "creeping consum-
erism," Friebolin calls it.
Then they have been
singed by the reality of the
ultimate reckoning.
Referee Friebolin says
that 90% of bankrupteies
now involve individuals,
not companies. The lure of
advertising is a narcotic
ever more skillfully com-
pounded. Business writes
off the loss as a part of the
cost of production. In his
profession Friebolin faces
the disillusioned debtor.
Political, even profes-
sional, promotion has nev-
er tempted him. Twenty
years ago he declined a
Federal judgeship. For his
role as a foremost citizen
in his community was a
big job, too. The robes of
a judge, he must have
thought, would inhibit his
avocation as a satirist and
gentle commentator on the
frailties, fads and phonies
of politics.
Thus for 33 years he has,
with some collaboration
from friends, been the
writer, director and pro-
ducer of the annual "Anvil
Revues," which is a high-
light in the life of the city.
It suffers nothing by com-
parison with the shows of
the Gridiron Club in Wash-
ington.

He is, however, quite
aware of the responsibility
inherent in his office. He
seeks to thwart, if possible,
heedless tampering with
the law which he adminis-
ters. He was near 80 when
he used his scalpel on one
of the works of Rep. Eman-
uel Celler, busybody chair-
man of the House Judici-
ary Committee. It was an
amendment to the bank-
ruptcy code which less
perceptive lawyers
thought to be a mark of
progress. In a powerful
legal article, fully docu-
mented and illuminated by
the distilled wisdom of
long experience, Friebolin
portrayed the amend-
ment's fallacies.
Friebolin's perception
that political ambition and
a sense of humor make a
bad marriage saved for
Cleveland the incompara-
ble value of his lyrical
commentaries on public
affairs. If politics amuses
you, behold, analyze, com-
ment, never practice. Prac-
tice is for stony hearts and
number nerves and the
sweet oblivion of incon-
sistency.

It will be a shock, I
know, for Friebolin and
many of his friends to sug-
gest Voltaire. For Voltaire
hated and hurt. But to bor-
row from Edgar Lee Mas-
ters, he "kept Europe in
laughter," and Europe was
the better for it.
What Friebolin did in
those past decades, like
Voltaire in his day, "was
to plow up the quack
grass, and turn up the
roots to the sun, and let
the sun kill them. For
laughter is sunlight, and
nothing of worth or of
truth needs to fear it."
