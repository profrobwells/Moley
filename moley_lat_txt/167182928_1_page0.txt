NATIONAL
GOLD RUSH
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If the eerie screams of
political medicine men and
the porcine squeals of spe-
cial interests go on for a
few more weeks and the
President's patience can
hold out, a time will arrive
for him to read the nation
a blasting lesson in sim-
ple patriotism.

For simply because he
has eliminated a few stops
on the route of the gravy
train he is being accused
of strangling the nation's
progress and neglecting
its essential resources. No
one among his critics
seems to realize that the
most precious resources
we have next to freedom
are our national credit and
solvency. None of those
who complain admits that
the state of international
affairs requires priorities.
And not one will admit
that considering all things
the President has present-
ed a pretty fair budget.
Nearly everyone is for his
own little bite, here and
now, without delay.

A notable commentator
finds everything wrong
with the budget requests.
He bewails the absence of
a Federal school construc-
tion program. But never,
and I am a regular reader
of his comments, over the
past three years has he
presented anything to jus-
tify such aid except the
phony figures of the Bu-
reau of Education. He also
bitterly complains about
"no new starts on water
resource developments."
But I'd doubt whether he
has been west of the Mis-
sissippi River in 15 years
except to go to the San
Francisco convention.

Another commentator
arguing for the National
Education Association's
plan for $25 to $100 a child
from Federal funds notes
the fact that the Depart-
ment of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare request
is for about $2,750,000,000
for fiscal 1959, while "the
total cost of the planned
highway progress is to be
40 billion dollars."

This is like feeling sor-
ry for a chicken because a
horse eats more. It is also
comparing one year with
several years.

Various pressure asso-
ciations interested in wa-
ter resources have made a
great clamor over the "no
new starts" proposal in the
budget.

Then, of course, farm
Senators are engaging in
the annual head-hunt
against Secretary Benson,
who is trying to rational-
ize supports.

After these special in-
terests have carried on a
bit longer the President
should really put the case
before the country, a case
for the priority of national
over local purposes and for
safety over pork. He could
very well turn the tide of
popularity that at the be-
ginning of his sixth year
seems to be running
against him. There is
enough common sense and
patriotism left in the coun-
try for a warm response
to such an appeal.
