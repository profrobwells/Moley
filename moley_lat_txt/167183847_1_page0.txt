Unions' Political Arm
Aims at Sen. Holland
BILOXI, Miss.-All over
the nation, on a scale
much greater than is gen-
erally believed, the polit-
ical machine of the unions,
crystallized in the AFL-
CIO Committee on Polit-
ical Education, is out to
liquidate conservative
members of Congress of
both parties. This power-
ful, experienced political
organization is set to ac-
complish AFL President
George Meany's determi-
nation to win for "lib-
erals" in 1958.

Evidence that this drive
will extend into the South
has been clear to me
everywhere on this trip-
in Virginia, in North Caro-
lina and in Northern Flor-
ida. It will also make a
heavy fight in Texas,
where I go from here.
Sen. Spessard Holland,
a notable, respected con-
servative who has repre-
sented Florida for several
years, is especially obnox-
ious to the political labor
bosses. They fought him
unsuccessfully when he
ran for Governor 18 years
ago-and have regularly op-
posed him since. Unlike
some "modern" Republi-
cans who would turn one
battered cheek after an-
other, Holland openly ac-
cepts the challenge.
"They don't seem to be
able to carry their own
people with them," he said
recently. "Members of la-
bor organizations are just
like other American cit-
izens; they have their own
views and convictions and
like to follow them."
For a while there were
indications that three fair-
ly well known Florida
Democrats were enter-
taining the idea of con-
testing with Holland in
the primary. But they
seem to have decided that
this would be a waste of
effort. It was believed for
a time that William G.
Cramer, a young Repub-
lican who represents the
Tampa district in the U.S.
House of Representatives,
would essay to oppose Hol-
land in the election.
But the judgment is
quite general over the
South that the bayonets
in Little Rock did much
more than prevent disor-
der there and effectively
ruined Republican chances
except in a few isolated
spots. Cramer occupies
one of those spots in his
district which he carried
with 56.4% of the vote in
1956 and which will prob-
ably return him this
year.
*
And so the portents
now point to that veteran
"liberal," Claude Pepper,
who was defeated by
George A. Smathers after
a terrific fight in 1950,
Since Pepper refrained
from a return match with
Smathers in 1956, it would
seem that this year pre-
sents his last chance for a
comeback. His philosophy,
thoroughly exposed in
1950, would meet the
Meany test perfectly. 'In
fact, his solid core of
strength was always cen-
tered in the political labor
leaders of the State. And
this year they are able to
give him much more sup-
port than ever before. It
is believed that he looks
forward eagerly to this
contest with such power-
ful national support. His
career was rooted in
hard times, which he at-
tributed to Republicans.
And now it looks as if such
a break of fortune in the
economy would tempt him
again.
