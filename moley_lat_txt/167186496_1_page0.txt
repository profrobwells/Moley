Arthur Miller's lawyer
had good cause to say, after
the Supreme Court deliv-
ered itself of the Watkins
decision, that the case
fitted his client "like a
glove."
Subsequently the Fed-
eral judge who had con-
victed Miller for contempt
set aside the verdict. He
had no option. The two
cases were precisely alike
in principle. Neither Wat-
kins nor Miller took the
Fifth Amendment, but sim-
ply refused to answer cer-
tain questions concerning
people with whom he had
been associated.
It will be interesting to
see what the Supreme Court
will do about the remaining
count upon which Miller
was convicted and which
the judge did not set aside.
That one involved the fact
that Miller knew of the
misuse of American pass-
ports by Communist con-
spirators.

Miller, being a philoso-
pher of a kind, no doubt
sees himself as a great de-
fender of human rights.
When he and his wife were
in England recently he pre-
pared for television an
adaptation of Ibsen's "An
Enemy of the People." This
talky, dreary play portrays
a man who, because of his
views, incurs the vehement
displeasure of his neigh-
bors. Miller provided a dis-
cursive essay as an intro-
duction for this adaptation.
In it he wrote:
"I believe this play can
be alive for us because its
central theme is, in my
opinion, the central theme
of our social life today.
Simply, it is the question of
whether democratic guar-
antees protecting political
minorities ought to be set
aside in time of crisis. More
personally, it is a question
whether one's vision of the
truth ought to be source of
guilt at a time when the
mass of men condemn it as
a devilish and dangerous
lie."
Since not only the lan-
guage used by Miller, but
the time and circumstances
under which the foregoing
was written plainly invite
a personal interpretation,
let us see how this applies
to Miller's refusal to co-
operate with a Congres-
sional committee.

First, he raises the ques-
tion of minority rights "in
time of crisis." This cer-
tainly applies to the peo-
ple with whom he had
associated. So far as the
application of minority
"rights" is concerned, they
can and should be circum-
scribed in time of crisis.
There is a paramount in-
terest involved-the safety
of the state and its mil-
lions of loyal citizens. Abra-
ham Lincoln answered that
point when he suspended
the writ of habeas corpus
in certain places in the
Civil War. Moreover, so far
as Miller's shady, shabby
pals were concerned, they
and their masters in the
Kremlin have created the
"crisis."
Miller's reference to a
personal "vision of the
truth" in the third sentence
quoted above indubitably
refers to the people whose
names he refused to di-
vulge. Clearly, he believes,
therefore, that Communism
is a "vision of the truth"
and that one who adheres
to the Communist faith is
guilty of no wrong and
should be subject to no
penalties, legal or other-
wise.
But Ibsen's hero at least
was willing to pay the pen-
alty for a deviation, just as
were the early Christians.
Miller would not only spare
his associates that penalty,
but he would in his asser-
tion of their right to be
protected place his so-
called conscience above and
in defiance of the govern-
ment under which he lives.
The tragedy is that the
Supreme Court in the Wat-
king case permits the wit-
ness to be the judge of what
is appropriate for Congress
to seek in its constitutional
task of law making.

The Miller and Watkins
cases did not involve the
personal right of a witness
to protect himself. In that
case, the situation might be
different, for the Congress
is neither a prosecuting
agency nor a court. Its pur-
pose in both cases was to
reveal the nature and per-
sonal identity of a con-
spiracy against the security
of the nation. Hence, it is
of the utmost importance
that the apparatus be re-
vealed, and since the ap-
paratus is made up of in-
dividuals, it is vital that
their identity be revealed.
This effort of Congress is
now frustrated by the Su-
preme Court.
