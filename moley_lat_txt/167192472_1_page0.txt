A CAUTIOUS CONGRESS
BUT WISE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The respective national
chairmen of the two parties
will offer differing views
as to the value of legisla-
tion passed and rejected
in the recent session of
Congress. That is standard
practice in politics. The
President said he was "dis-
appointed."

But after a careful ap-
praisal of what was passed
and what was rejected it
is quite clear that in some
mysterious way the col-
lective wisdom of the mem-
bers of Congress was better
for all of us than the am-
bitious program submitted
by the President.

Once more, the Presi-
dent's program was more
honored by its rejection
than in its acceptance. In
fact, the acceptance of the
program as presented by
the President would have
been a serious threat to na-
tional solvency and to the
constitutional balance be-
tween State and nation.
High on the list of "ac-
complishments" for which
both parties will claim
credit was the revised civil
rights legislation. In its
original form it would have
been a flagrant invasion of
the rights of the States and
would have given birth to
ill feelings, disorder and
disunity. Presumably, the
ambitious version of the
original bill—drafted by
an Attorney General who
was appointed not because
of legal eminence but be-
cause he masterminded
the nomination of Gen. Ei-
senhower—was an open
and palpable bid for votes.
The bill finally passed,
while accepted with reluc-
tance by those who believe
in States' rights, will do no
great harm.

The President's program
for Federal aid for schools
would have flung wide
open the way to control of
the schools of the nation
by a Federal bureaucracy,
dominated in all probabil-
ity by such pressure groups
as the American Federa-
tion of Teachers, the Na-
tional Education Associa-
tion and the lobby of the
AFL-CIO. Moreover, it
would have poured out
Federal money for some-
thing which the States
and local districts can well
afford to provide for them-
selves.

The House, once more,
prevented the authoriza-
tion of the Fryingpan
Project, which would have
cost the nation's taxpayers
close to $200,000,000 for a
very doubtful benefit.

In the field of interna-
tional meddling with the
national economy, a sub-
ject for which the Presi-
dent seems to have an
affinity, there was blocked
an effort to have the
United States participate
in the organization for
trade co-operation. This
would have been a step
toward giving to an inter-
national authority power
which should always be
carefully kept in the hands
of Congress.

While the amount of
spending authorized for
1958 varies according to
how you compute it, the
fact is that Congress did
actually reduce the budget
request of the President
something between 3 bil-
lion dollars and 5 billion
dollars.

It is true that with the
vast bulk of unexpended
balances held over from
appropriations in former
years the administration
will spend almost as much
as the President requested.
But the House—always
in recent years more
economical than the Pres-
ident or the Senate—did
well in its reduction. Only
a drastic revision of fiscal
methods, by which the
slate can be wiped clean
this year and all former
appropriations which are
not spent can come up for
review, will enable Con-
gress to control spending.
It would have been well
had Congress conceded to
the President's request for
permission to veto items in
appropriation bills.

The President was up-
held in his effort to estab-
lish a partnership with
local and private agencies
in resource development
when the House killed the
Hell's Canyon bill already
passed by the Senate. This
was a net gain for econ-
omy. A compromise was
reached on the Niagara
Development Plan by
which the New York State
Power Authority, with re-
strictions, will build the
project.

Once more, Congress
frowned upon the efforts
of the administration to ex-
pand the foreign aid pro-
gram. The final figure will
have little relationship to
what will be spent because
of huge unexpended bal-
ances. But slowly there is
being established a national
policy which opposes the
effort of internationally
minded bureaucrats to buy
friendship and national
security with money.

Altogether, this was not
a do-nothing or phony
Congress. It proved itself
to be a watchful and wary
Congress.
