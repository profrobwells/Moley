RAYMOND MOLEY:
Prof. Schlesinger's
Change of Attitude
To modify the form but
not the substance of a fa-
miliar bit of scriptural ad-
vice, there should be more
rejoicing when a brand is
snatched from the burning
than in the comforting
presence of several cords
of unburned sticks.
If anyone has ever glori-
fied the philosophy of so-
cial rather than individual
responsibility more than
Prof. Arthur M. Schlesing-
er Jr., I have not known
that person. But in a no-
table address to the Amer-
ican Historical Association,
that politically minded
Harvard professor admon-
ished his hearers and the
big foundations generally
against current overem-
phasis on group research
projects in the social sci-
ences. Great history, he
said, will never be writ-
ten by a committee. I
might add that the same
might be said of any great
novel or painting or
speech or play.
*
Prof. Schlesinger should
know how that truth ap-
plies to the preparation of
speeches for a national
candidate, since he accom-
panied Adlai Stevenson on
his lost crusades.
I had a part in a crusade
some years ago which, in-
cidentally, did not end in
disaster. In that experi-
ence, invaluable to my
own education, the actual
formulation of a speech
was never done by a group
of eggheads collectively.
There could be innumera-
ble contributions, but
when the facts were all
gathered it devolved upon
only two persons to shape
the product—the man who
was to speak it and the
man who was to put the
words together.
On only one occasion did
I bring the so-called brain
trust together to formu-
late a speech for Candidate
Roosevelt. The result was
disastrous. Everybody ob-
jected to the ideas or the
expressions thereof of
everybody else. Endless
argument resulted. Final-
ly, the product was the
least common denominator
of all, which was verbal
dishwater. And after that
horrible evening, two of
the group betook them-
selves to the ephemeral
but relieving narcosis of
alcohol and were-not seen
for a week. The final prod-
uct I had to do alone the
next morning—a product
which ignored all the ideas
of the night before.
In 1948 I saw on Candi-
date Dewey's train a high-
ly organized group sitting
in a Pullman car and doing
a speech for the candidate
at a round table fringed by
experts. I had then a clear
explanation of why the
nation found so little in-
spiration in the candi-
date's utterances and why
a disgusted electorate
turned to crude extempo-
raneous Trumanisms.
*
The same principle ap-
plies to the writing of
history. True, the great
Cambridge histories were
written by many scholars.
The plan was the work of
Lord Acton. But as his-
torical literature these
products are not as out-
standing as, for example,
Bryce's "Holy Roman Em-
pire." They are reference
material, generally dull
and often unreadable. This
applies also to the vast
poll taking and head-
counting that goes into so
many of the foundation-
subsidized studies in polit-
ical science, sociology and
psychology.
A master may have cer-
tain help (even Michelan-
gelo had a little) but the
final work is done by a
lonely man expressing an
individual's concept of
truth.
*
The reason why Schle-
singer's warning is most
important, however, is
that it represents a drift
against what in egghead-
ese is called "groupism."
Turned into the area of
public policy, it consists
of tossing responsibility
for individual wrong onto
a vague collectivism called
society. It also interprets
great events as the mani-
festation of collective, in-
stinctive and generally
materialistic movements,
never as the manifestation
of the prodigious influence
of an individual.
If Prof. Schlesinger will
apply his rule to his his-
torical writing, we shall,
perhaps, have a valuable
worker in the cause of re-
turning sanity.
