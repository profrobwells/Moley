RAYMOND MOLEY:
President's Financial
Estimates Justified
Back in the Truman
years I often consulted Dr.
Julius Hirsch, an econom-
ic consultant who prior to
the Hitler regime had high
standing in the economic
and university life of Ger-
many. Invariably, his pre-
dictions of spending and
of tax income were much
more accurate than those
of the President. Indeed,
the various revisions of
estimates by President
Truman as the year wore
on were always moving
toward what Hirsch had
estimated in January.
This year I have con-
sulted Oracle Hirsch again.
His verdict on this year's
budget estimates is not
unhappy. He calls atten-
tion to the size of the
budget estimates com-
pared with the gross na-
tional product and shows
that the percentage of the
It is true that there is
plenty of fat in the re-
quests for civilian pur-
poses. But in a number of
respects the President has
taken bold steps notably
in holding back the de-
mands of school propa-
gandists and public power
zealots. But if the line can
be held business should
have some reassurance
from this prospect.
That there will be a defi-
cit Hirsch readily admits.
But he says that any defi-
cit such as may be con-
templated will not greatly
contribute to inflation.
Back in the Roosevelt days
when the administration
was deliberately attempt-
ing to induce rising prices
by deficits the effort was
not successful. A wave of
wage increases such as
Reuther is demanding

GNP represented by the
budget estimate for fiscal
1958 is not much above
1956 and 1957 and is be-
low 1952, 1953, 1954, and
1955.
His figures, in which the
GNP data are based on the
President's Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers publica-
tion Indicators for Janu-
ary, 1958, are shown in
current dollar values in
the accompanying table.
I am quite familiar with
the inadequacy of the
method employed in calcu-
lating the GNP. But for
comparative purposes and
and in this context they
are useful. The President
and members of his ad-
ministration are going to
be quite justified in call-
ing attention to this com-
parison and, for the most
part, in placing the re-
sponsibility on a Demo-
cratic Congress for any
large increases in spend-
ing beyond the estimates.
There may be increases
for which subsequent re-
quests by the President
may be made as condi-
tions require them.
flationary than a deficit of
a billion or two.
Hirsch further urges
that in this budget are
certain capital expendi-
tures, such as the building
by the Atomic Energy
Commission of prototype
plants for the production
of power, which might
well be spread over a pe-
riod of years. These would
amount, Hirsch estimates,
to somewhere between 5
and 9 billion.
Above all Hirsch points
out that business and con-
sumers' confidence to
which much of the pros-
perity of the past few
years is due must play a
large part. That confidence
may well come with a re-
duction in the rate of in-
crease in the unemployed
and from vigorous Presi-
dential assurances of con-
fidence himself in the ca-
pacity of a free economy
to regain its equilibrium
if relieved of threats from
hostile government action.
In short, this is no time to
lose that assurance which
is justified by past experi-
ences with slowing busi-
ness activity.
