FEDERALISM
ADVANCES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last week, while attending the annual meeting of
the Oklahoma Public Expenditures Council, I was
impressed by the firm
stand of that State taxpayers'
group against the further
growth of Federal
handouts to the States.
These local and State taxpayers
know that for every dollar they
get in that way they must pay
back more than a dollar, now or
ultimately.
They know also that these
grants are possible only because
the Federal government is stealing
their tax sources, in excises and
the like. They realize, too, that
the growth of matching grants
means that they must impose
more local and State burdens
upon themselves. And, finally,
they know that as the Federal
establishment grows, their own
power and independence diminish.
For wherever a Federal dollar
goes, a bureaucratic busybody is
close behind. Proof of this is in
every telephone book in the cities
over the land. There you will
find listed dozens of the local
offices of this or that Federal
bureau.

There are 35 of these State
taxpayers' groups in this country,
and 22 are active in opposing
extravagance at the Federal level.
They have their own National
Taxpayers' Conference, which
meets in Washington at intervals.
Steve Stahl of the Oklahoma
group has been chairman of the
national conference for 11 years.
Last year they adopted the
campaign theme: "I'll take less
from government if government
will take less from me." These
groups had most to do in stimulating
the famous 1957 economy uprising
in the States. For their voices are
heard, however reluctantly, by 44
Senators and 22 Representatives
in Congress.
They are still in there fighting,
despite the relentless Federal tide.
Federal handouts to States continue
despite all the brave words and
earnest recommendations of
President Eisenhower. In the first
year of his administration the
budget asked for $2,875,000,000
in aid to States. Congress, however,
went on adding programs until the
figure for 1959 is $6,259,000,000.

The amount of these grants in
1956 was 25 times that of 1934.
The President has brought about
the creation of two commissions to
deal with this alarming increase.
The first one, named after its
chairman, Meyer Kestnbaum,
submitted a good report, which was
almost entirely ignored by Congress.
Then the President brought
Kestnbaum into the White House to
work on the subject, and at the
1957 Governors' conference proposed
a joint Federal-State action committee.
At a meeting in Chicago this year,
the committee recommended to
Congress that the States take over
the older vocational education
programs, at a saving for the
Federal Treasury of $37,000,000.
It also proposed that the Federal
government stop its payments to
cities for waste treatment, that the
Federal-State responsibility for
disaster relief be "clarified," and
that some of the local telephone
taxes be turned over to the States.
★
Then this "action" committee
appointed some subcommittees and
called it a day. All this rigmarole,
even if adopted by Congress, would
cut grants to the States only 3%.
It does seem that with vast
international programs, defense at
home and abroad, and the recession
before it, the Federal government
might forgo fussing with garbage in
Podunk, Johnny's vocational choice
between life as a carpenter or
veterinarian, and the like.
The 10th Amendment is still in
the Constitution. It provides that
powers not delegated to the United
States shall be "reserved to the
States respectively, or to the
people." Perhaps Congress regards
itself as "the people."
