A GUIDE TO USEFUL LIVING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If any youngster expects
to learn an easy way to
riches by reading the first
volume of Bernard M. Ba-
ruch's autobiography he
will be sadly disappointed.
If, on the other hand, he
wants to get a few pointers
on how to live usefully and
happily, with or without
great wealth, he could find
no better guide than "Ba-
ruch: My Own Story," just
published.
For Baruch's unique con-
tribution has been that he
found success in remem-
bering a few homely mat-
ters that most of us be-
lieve are too obvious to
bother with.
First and foremost in the
Baruch mentality is an ex-
ceedingly large amount of
caution. When he was serv-
ing as chairman of the War
Industries Board in World
War I President Wilson,
who had a way of likening
the characteristics of people
he knew to those of certain
animals and birds, said that
Baruch reminded him of an
elephant. That large and
intelligent animal, so Wil-
son said, would come to a
bridge and stop and test
its strength by trying one
front foot and then anoth-
er; then, after some ele-
phantine cogitation, would
say to itself: "It's perfectly
safe all right. But I will
wait and let some other
animal cross first."
Baruch, in his book, says
that Wilson was in the
habit of calling him "Dr.
Facts," because of his in-
sistence that nothing he de-
cided until all available in-
formation had been col-
lected and digested.
Baruch was popularly
known as a "Wall Street
speculator." With a mind
finely adapted to the ne-
cessity of good public rela-
tions, Baruch insisted on
providing his own defini-
tion of "speculator." He
was, in fact, a speculator,
he said, but in the philo-
sophical senseâ€”a person
who cogitated on the mean-
ing of things and drew con-
clusions and principles
from known facts and ra-
tional inferences therefrom.
In his book he makes it
clear that his success in
the market was not due to
chance or to mysterious
"hunches." It was due to
the fact that when he
bought or sold securities
his decision was based upon
a careful examination of
the companies involved, the
market for their product,
the competition which they
were likely to encounter
and the other innumerable
components which are in-
volved in business success
or failure.
Those who have drawn
the conclusion that because
Baruch has had a better
"press" than any public fig-
ure in his generation, he
has vainly imagined he
could portray himself as a
man who never made a
mistake, will be surprised
at the candor of this book.
His shortcomings as a boy
and young man, his mis-
takes of judgment in the
market, which on more
than one occasion were
catastrophic, he frankly
set forth.
Perhaps this frankness in
facing up to his mistakes is
one of the primary reasons
for his success. He learned
from his errors of judgment
and he refused to be in-
toxicated by his successes.
He has always made it
clear to his friends and in-
timates that he is not as
rich as rumor would have
it. This I believe is alto-
gether true. His worldly
assets are not small. But
certainly they are far, far
less than a person of his
talents and habits of cir-
cumspection could have ac-
quired in such lush times
as he has seen.
This limit on what he ac-
cumulated has been due to
a number of factors, cau-
tion and the good sense to
realize that mere accumu-
lation is neither wise nor
moral nor patriotic.
There is in his nature a
fine sense of proportion.
Wealth in his mind should
be related to one's general
plan of life, not necessarily
to one's capacity to get it.
Another limiting factor
was his love of public serv-
ice, which took him away
from the market to serve
President Wilson in the
very prime of his life.
He is known as an ad-
viser of many Presidents
but his abiding affection
and admiration have al-
ways remained with Wil-
son. After the Wilson pe-
riod his most lasting and
interesting relationship was
with Franklin D. Roosevelt.
This relationship, while al-
ways marked by outward
cordiality, was never warm
and intimate.
*
There were many rea-
sons for this lack and for
the consequent failure of
Roosevelt to use Baruch in
large official capacities.
One was Baruch's distaste
for so many of the poli-
cies which Roosevelt adopt-
ed. Another was his dis-
like of so many of the
Roosevelt intimates.
But most important of
all was the reason once
given to Baruch by a
friend who knew both the
men. Commenting on
Roosevelt's failure to call
on Baruch for more im-
portant tasks, this friend
said, "You are just too
luminous a figure." In short,
F.D.R. was more com-
fortable in the company of
men of lesser stature.
Despite his willingness
to serve even under un-
pleasant conditions, Ba-
ruch's relations with Presi-
dent Truman ended in a
rancorous and boorish at-
tack by the man in the
White House.
The high repute in which
Baruch is held by Ameri-
cans has outlived that of
scores of statesmen who
have held offices more emi-
nent than any he occupied.
That at 87 is his deserved
reward.
