RAYMOND MOLEY:
Battle of the Budget
May Still Be Lost
At the moment it seems who actually believe that a
that the battle of the budget
has been won. Not by the
President, not by Demo-
crats in Congress, but by
the forgotten and despised
taxpayer.
I say "seems," for we
shall not know for a year
whether the cut of 2 bil-
lion dollars ordered by the
President will actually be
made. There have been
threats and commands to
the bureaucrats before on
this subject which have
been ignored.
But before we leave the
subject, it may be well to
offer a comment on one of
the major arguments of
the administration for the
amount of spending asked
for in January-the argu-
ment that the Republican
platform of 1956 pledged
the administration and the
Republican Party to the
items in the budget.
Just what sort of moral
obligation can a political
platform impose upon a
party? Or, to put it in phil-
osophical terms, can a
document immoral in itself
create a moral obligation in
anyone?
This document, like all
such, was written by a
group of harassed dele-
gates, hounded on all sides
by cranks and special inter-
ests, and intent on seeing
that nothing was omitted
that might snare a vote.
*
Normally, a platform is
an amalgam of perspiration
and inspiration. Inclusion
is the order of the day, and
hence the inordinate length
of the document. Compro-
mise is its nature, persua-
sion its purpose, noncom-
mittal its import and vague
its promises. A perfect plat-
form says all things to all
men.
Ordinarily, professional
politicians say as little as
possible about a platform
after the election. But, ex-
cept for the Vice-President,
this is not an administra-
tion of professionals. Most
of them are naive people
platform is taken seriously.
A generation of students
in school and college have
been amused by their
teachers' exposure of the
inconsistencies and banali-
ties of political jargon. A
political platform, says a
standard political witti-
cism, is like a platform on a
railroad car-something to
get in on, not to stand on.
This 1956 affair was
neither better nor worse
than the average; perhaps
duller than many and less
vitriolic than some. But it
yields to none in inconsist-
ency.
*
It would put into effect
the Hoover and Kestnbaum
commission recommenda-
tions. It would reduce
spending, balance the budg-
et, cut the national debt and
-so far as consistent with
a balanced budget-lessen
the burden of taxation. But
it would also help small
businesses, accelerate the
vast highway program,
build schools all over the
country, replace the war-
built merchant fleet with
modern types, provide all
sorts of benefits to farmers,
pour money into dams and
irrigation, and give eco-
nomic aid for "the under-
developed areas of the free
world."
The pressure of opinion,
however, sometimes pre-
vails over the platitudes
and promises of politics. In
this case, after months in
which we were assured
that the original budget
represented the indispen-
sable minimum for, fiscal
1958, we are now told that
2 billion dollars can be
saved.
*
And now it is the turn
of the Democrats to mani-
fest the infinite capacity of
politicians to be inconsist-
ent. Their outcry is that
this Eisenhower command
to reduce spending is rank
treachery. It takes away
their one issue, and that is
that, for a few months at
least, they were to be the
party of economy.
