AMERICAN
HERITAGE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the midst of alarms
concerning Soviet superi-
ority over the United
States in one line or an-
other, a politically or per-
sonally inspired canard
persists to the effect that
Russia has already pushed
ahead in the development
of electric power from
nuclear energy.
There is little actual
evidence to base this upon
except the undeniable fact
that a small pilot plant ex-
ists near Moscow, and an-
other with similar capac-
ity is under way. There are
vast plans, of course, and
these will involve many
types of reactors. Specific
information about these,
however, is most indefinite.
*
It takes little knowledge
of the facts to assume that
since information about
the many types of plants
is common knowledge in
the United States and Brit-
ain, it is easy for the
Soviet propagandists to say
that they are planning
such types. But between
the concept and the com-
pletion of operations, a
vast area of practical ap-
plication stands in the way.
And in that area of know-
how, the United States is
far ahead.
Our advantage is open
for all to see. A prototype
plant has been operating
at Oak Ridge for some
time which produces more
kilowatts than the Rus-
sian reactor.
Another such pilot plant
has been built and is in
operation at Vallecitos,
Cal. This one is the first
of the kind entirely fi-
nanced and built by pri-
vate industries.
The Shippingport plant
in Pennsylvania is a part-
nership arrangement with
the government, the Du-
quesne Light Co. and
Westinghouse participat-
ing. This one alone has a
dozen times the capacity
of the Soviet plant.
*
The Vallecitos plant is
a small edition of a Chi-
cago Commonwealth Edi-
son-General Electric plant
under construction at
Dresden, III. Just as this
enormously larger plant
is enjoying the lessons
learned at Vallecitos, so is
the New York Common-
wealth Edison copying the
model at Shippingport
with a 250,000-kilowatt
plant, and so also is the
Yankee Atomic Electric
in New England, with a
134,000-kilowatt establish-
ment.
This method of using
small prototypes or pilot
plants as models for larger
ones is an old one with us.
As Charles Kettering once
pointed out, mass produc-
tion consists in creating a
model with great care and
precision, and beyond that
the production in quantity
is relatively easy.
The lessons learned by
pure science are general-
ly the world's property.
But the application of
these is a practical mat-
ter in which experience
plays a predominant part.
The United States with its
vastly decentralized and
competitive industrial sys-
tem has been building ex-
perience since that remote
date when Russia was a
medieval peasant econ-
omy.

Every mechanic who
plumbs the mysteries of
your automobile motor or
your television set is
standing on the firm
ground of that experi-
ence. So, in a more ad-
vanced and systematic
way, are the engineers and
designers who plan and
execute the new improve-
ments on every yearly
automobile model. The
development of the in-
ternal combustion engine,
the refining of oil, the
shaping of electrical ma-
chinery, and the extrac-
tion of useful materials
from ores have all created
the heritage which goes
into nuclear progress.
I simplify the subject to
say that the problem of
safe and useful manage-
ment of nuclear energy is
a vastly enlarged and
complicated plumbing op-
eration.
There is no reason to
be complacent, but it is
well at times to seek the
reassurance of such an in-
comparable advantage as
is ours in the practical ap-
plication of knowledge
tested over the genera-
tions to the new discov-
eries of science.
