DECISION
IN TEXAS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the course of this
year Texas will seriously
lest the Federal govern-
ment's effort to integrate
all schools in the South. A
comparison of the Texas
situation with that in
South Carolina shows how
greatly the problem varies
from State to State.
In South Carolina the le-
gal defenses against forced
integration were worked
out in great detail even be-
fore the Supreme Court
rendered its momentous
decision in 1954. The most
important part of South
Carolina's legal plan is to
cut off State funds from
any school affected by the
order of any court. This
has not been tested in the
Federal courts and may
not be for some time.
★
In Texas, on the other
hand, the problem is not
State-wide, as in other
Southern States. In 125
Texas school districts seg-
regation has been abol-
ished since 1954. These
districts have no serious
problem because relatively
few Negroes are involved.
The big problem will be
in the more populous cen-
ters, and Dallas may well
be the most serious test-
ing ground.
Under a law passed in
the regular session of the
Legislature last spring, no
Texas district can inte-
grate without a favorable
vote in a local option elec-
tion. If the school authori-
ties in any district permit
integration without such
an election, State financial
aid can be cut off forth-
with. In Dallas this would
mean the loss of $1,500,000
in State funds.
In November, Gov. Price
Daniel called a special ses-
sion of the Legislature to
consider some additional
legislation. A bill was spon-
sored by the Governor and
passed which gives the
Governor power to close
any school on certification
by the local Board of Edu-
cation that violence or the
danger of violence could
not be prevented except
by the use of military force
or occupation. Out-of-class-
room instruction could be
conducted while such a
school remained closed.
This is called the "anti-
troop" law.
★
Another law was passed,
not sponsored by the Gov-
ernor, which is aimed at
the NAACP. It would re-
quire any organization
which participates in ac-
tivities designed to "hin-
der, harass and interfere
with" the operation of
public schools to disclose
its local membership.
Since the special session
of the Legislature, the
Federal Court of Appeals
sitting in New Orleans re-
versed a Federal District
Court, which had ordered
that the Dallas School Dis-
trict abolish segregation
by midterm 1958. The
higher court declared that
the district judge had gone
beyond the "all deliberate
speed" rule, as stated by
the Supreme Court and
later in New Orleans that
they were working out
plans which would be com-
pleted by midsummer.
Even though granted
this delay, Dallas is con-
cerned whether integra-
tion can be successfully ac-
complished by next fall.
