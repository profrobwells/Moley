RAYMOND MOLEY:
Lessons for GOP in
Tammany's System
In a previous piece I de-
scribed the feud that is at
present shaking the Re-
publican Party in the city
of New York. To a degree,
the leadership in a revolt
against Thomas J. Cur-
ran's regular organization
in New York County (Man-
hattan) is John Roosevelt,
youngest son of F. D. R.
and a Republican of some
years' standing, and Rob-
ert K. Christenberry, the
most recent sacrifice in
Republican efforts to win
the Mayoralty of the big
city.
John Roosevelt has been
feuding with Curran for
some months, and Chris-
tenberry, who believes that
Curran's organization
failed to help as it should
in the recent campaign, has
organized what newspa-
pers call the "Secret Sev-
enteen," a group intent
upon taking over the lead-
ership.
It is not clear what these
rebels want, but vaguely
they are making sounds
which suggest that they
believe the old Republi-
cans are not "modern"
enough. In other words,
the thing is based upon a
belief that by espousing
some ideological adapta-
tion of New Dealism-per-
haps as Thomas E. Dewey
attempted in his cam-
paigns for President-vot-
ers will flock to the GOP.
This symptom is com-
mon to much of the so-
called "modern" Republi-
canism over the nation.
Some people fail to realize
that the mustered vote is
the pay-off in politics and
that issues are secondary.
At any rate, this funda-
mental lesson is not lost
on Tammany, nor has it
been overlooked by that
organization. And except
for occasions when corrup-
tions become so hideous
that voters elect a reform
ticket, Tammany gets the
votes.
At this moment of Re-
publican discord over
vague differences in ideol-
ogy, a calm man who wears
dark glasses and speaks
softly has had something
really vital to say. He is
Carmine De Sapio, Tam-
many leader, Democratic
National Committeeman
and Gov. Harriman's po-
litical mastermind. Ignor-
ing matters of ideology,
which never have merited
anything but some windy
phrases from Tammany,
De Sapio tells how he in-
tends to build up a major-
ity for the Governor next
year:
"I predict that Gov. Har-
riman will be re-elected
by a minimum plurality
of 300,000, no matter who
is nominated by the Re-
publicans."
This is the first year of
permanent registration in
New York City, PPR, as it
is called. The results of
getting eligible voters to
register this year under
this system were fairly
good, but De Sapio is not
satisfied:
"Now that the system
has been installed success-
fully," he says, "and all the
fears about it have evap-
orated, I am confident that
we can add another 300,-
000 to our present PPR to-
tal. If we achieve that goal
Gov. Harriman will un-
doubtedly garner about
200,000 of those potential
voters. With the opposi-
tion getting 100,000 there
would be a net gain of
100,000 Democrats. This
would hike Harriman's
plurality to 400,000."
It should be understood
that he is not talking
about fussing with regis-
trations upstate. Demo-
crats waste no time getting
people to register in places
where they are not likely
to get the tiger's share for
themselves. They work in
areas where past experi-
ences and the expert
knowledge of district lead-
ers indicate that the ma-
jority are inclined to be
Democratic.
Thus, the race for a ma-
jority is between two cr-
ganizations getting out
their own vote. Real poli-
ticians never bother much
about converting the oppo-
sition. That takes too much
effort and time. They aim
to get those who lean their
way to register and vote.
And the contest is at the
precinct and door-to-door
level. Because Tammany
has this lesson in mind, it
wins election after elec-
tion.
Unless Republicans—
from the White House to
the village clerk of Pos-
sum Hollow—can learn
this lesson, their party will
never prevail for long.
Last year a "young Re-
publican," referring not
just to New York but to
the national picture, asked
me, "When are the Re-
publicans going to be the
majority party?"
I answered, "You are a
majority now if you get
the vote out and stop fuss-
ing about issues and ide-
ologies."
