THE COURT'S SOCIALIST MENTOR
In the publication
"U.S.A." an article by Alice
Widener summarizes some
of the international views
of a man who has since
1954 become fairly well
known in the United
States, Gunnar Myrdal, a
Swedish Socialist and
economist.
Before 1954 Myrdal was
well known among a lim-
ited few in the so-called
intellectual class of Amer-
icans and he had received
a number of high distinc-
tions therefrom. For ex-
ample, he was selected in
1954 for high honors at
Columbia University on
the occasion of its bicen-
tennial. In 1949 he re-
ceived a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation.
Early in the 1930s he re-
ceived a grant from the
Spelman (Rockefeller)
Fund. And he was later
invited by Harvard to de-
liver the Godkin Lectures.

Amid this shower of at-
tention he was commis-
sioned by the Carnegie
Corp. to make a study of
the Negro problem in the
United States, the findings
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
of which were published
under the title, "The
American Dilemma."
This enormous tome,
some 1400 pages long,
would probably have been
consigned to gathering
dust, had it not been of-
fered as a major "author-
ity" for the segregation de-
cision in 1954. The book
offers many contemptuous
comments concerning this
country, its Constitution,
and Americans generally.
These references have
been pretty well aired in
the last three years.

Two years ago, as chief
of the U.N. Economic Com-
mission for Europe, Myr-
dal was responsible for a
violently critical report on
the "monopolistic" prac-
tices of American oil com-
panies operating in the
Middle East. This report
was for a considerable
time kept from American
distribution, but was well
publicized by the Europe-
an press and did little to
promote our popularity
among our allies there.
The Widener article dis-
cusses a series of lectures
by Myrdal in Cairo in
1955. The gist of his argu-
ment in these lectures is
to promote not only a
class struggle within
capitalistic nations but
within the non-Communist
nations—a class struggle
in which the "lower class"
nations would band to-
gether against the more
developed and wealthy
ones to wipe out inequality
among nations and lead
to a world-wide welfare
state. Thus, to use his
words, he is showing how
"I could see world solidar-
ity coming to us and the
gradual emergence of . . .
the world state."
The following quota-
tion from Myrdal's lec-
tures is almost precisely
the prescription for inter-
national Socialism written
several years ago by Stalin
himself:
★
"No society has ever
substantially reformed it-
self by a movement from
above; by a simple volun-
tary decision of an upper
class, springing from so-
cial conscience, to become
equal with the lower class-
es and give them free en-
trance to the class mo-
nopolics. Ideals and the
social conscience do play
their very considerable
role, which should not be
forgotten, but they are
weak as self-propelled
forces, originating reforms
on a large scale; they need
the pull of demands being
raised and pressed for.
When power has been as-
sembled by those who
have grievances, and the
storm is gathering, then
is the time when ideals
and the social conscience
can become effective."
It is now easy to see
what intellectual support
this sort of thing gave to
the operations of Nasser
and to suggest that Nasser
in seizing the Suez Canal
six months later was mere-
ly implementing what is
coming to be called Myr-
dalism.
Which suggests again
that Socialism will not
come by a direct means. It
will come through the
gradual weakening of the
fabric of nations like the
United States and Britain
by the relentless extension
of welfarism and at the
same time by the mach-
inations of international
commissions designed to
bring in Socialism through
international action.
