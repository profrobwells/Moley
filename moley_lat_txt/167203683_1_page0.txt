The widely publicized
tidy bit of cash to Farmer
Eisenhower on what he
didn't grow is one more re-
minder that the soil bank
program was a matter of
expediency rather than
considered policy.
It helped the Republi-
can administration to off-
set a troublesome political
crisis characterized by fall-
ing farm income and it
helped measurably to re-
lieve the burden of sur-
pluses. So far as the fur-
ther publicized fact that a
great deal of money went
to large corporate farming
operations—67 farms re-
ceiving more than $50,-
000—the conclusion was
drawn by weary taxpayers
that the program was not
really going to the needy
alone.
However, the large item
in the current budget for
farm subsidies reminds us
that the soil bank is no
answer to the basic diffi-
culty.
This fact is readily. ad-
mitted by Secretary Ben-
son himself.

William B. Camp is one
of the best known and
most sensible farmers in
the United States. He lives
in Bakersfield, Cal., and
carries on a considerable
agricultural operation
there while at the same
time he owns and operates
farms in his native State
of South Carolina.
In a recent speech greet-
ing his fellow South Caro-
linians after his return
from a visit in Europe, he
had several things to say
which deserve attention
not only in Congress but
by taxpayers generally.
He noted the rapid de-
crease in the number of
family-sized farms. In the
past four years alone the
total number of farms has
declined 10%. That means
that 120,000 farms a year
are losing their identity
either by consolidation or
by abandonment. How-
ever, according to Camp,
the family-operated farm
is not dying out. It still
comprises 97% of the to-
tal. It is the small, ineffi-
cient farms that are van-
ishing, and the former op-
erators are either turning
to industrial jobs or are
working for operators of
larger units.
What is happening is
that agriculture is com-
ing to be a much larger
economic entity than the
mere planting and harvest-
ing of crops. And that in-
tegrated part of our econo-
my is very large. Of 62,-
000,000 employed Ameri-
cans, 25,000,000 work
somewhere in agriculture.

A favorite topic with
Farmer Camp is the de-
vice of irrigation. This is
not just the irrigation of
desert places at the ex-
pense of the Federal gov-
ernment—although that
method has moved the cen-
ter of cotton production
from the Southeast to
California, Arizona and
New Mexico.
In part because of the
energetic preaching of
Farmer Camp himself, the
idea of irrigation has be-
come widely adopted in
places like South Carolina,
where a generation ago no
one would dream of a
shortage of water. True,
there is plenty of water
in such humid and semi-
humid States. But to get
the highest efficiency,
farmers must take meas-
ures to see that it is prop-
erly distributed over the
growing season. Such sup-
plemental irrigation, at a
small fraction of the cost
of irrigating arid land, is,
according to Camp, "the
most important thing now
offered for the improve-
ment of agriculture in the
rainfall belt, especially in
the Southeast. In my
opinion, the time is not
far distant when all the
better farmers will accept
irrigation just as readily
as they accept tractors
and electricity today."
This expert testimony is
another piece of evidence
supporting the conclusion
that while subsidies may
be expedient they can
never be a permanently
successful policy.
