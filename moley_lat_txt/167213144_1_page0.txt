RAYMOND MOLEY:
Sherman Adams' Blast
at Democrats' Tactics
On Monday, Jan. 20,
Sherman Adams, assistant
to the President and erst-
while White House goat,
was probably the most un-
popular member of the
administration among Re-
publicans in Congress. On
Tuesday he was a hero
in his party. No figure in
the GOP, excepting the
President and Vice-Presi-
dent, is so much in de-
mand as a speaker to in-
spire Republican gather-
ings. The Republican Na-
tional Committee is
swamped with demands
for his ringing oratory.
Here is, in part, what
he said to a Republican
crowd in Minneapolis on
the evening of the admin-
istration's fifth anniver-
sary:
"They (the Democrats)
ought to know better than
to keep on politicking
with national defense. As
a matter of fact, they
ought to be called strictly
to account by the Ameri-
can people for using this
subject for party glue.
"I'll say simply this: We
Republicans greet the op-
position on this battlefield
with as much anticipa-
tion as any other they can
conjure up. In such a con-
test we have abundant
ammunition.
*
"We do not need to
bring up the military ca-
tastrophe of Pearl Harbor
nor the scientific ca-
tastrophe of losing our
atomic secrets. (Which
means in political oratory
that the subject is really
being brought up.) Nor do
we need to dwell on pol-
icies that led to the Red
invasion of Korea, nor the
plight of our defenses
when the invasion began,
nor the handcuffs put on
our conduct of that war.
"We need not even re-
fer to the tragic loss of
China, nor the surrender
of positions of freedom
throughout the world. We
can also ignore, at the mo-
ment, the crippling de-
fense planning between
World War II and the fol-
lowing war they couldn't
end. Right now, checking
back only a year is
enough."
This is the sort of talk
that makes for real two-
party government, which
in the last analysis is the
bulwark of our political
freedom.
*
To be sure, this speech,
contrasted with the Presi-
dent's mild remarks in
Chicago, had evoked a tor-
rent of complaint. Demo-
crats know how to fight
political battles and their
tactic is to blame the Ei-
senhower administration
for real and alleged weak-
nesses in our defenses in
one breath and, in another,
to scream that any attack
upon their record is un-
fair. That is the sort of
thing that brings Casey
Stengel stamping from the
dugout to protest against
an umpire's decision that
he knows is fair and that
he knows he cannot
change.
The lamentable thing
is that such complaints
from Democrats about
such fighting talk have
hitherto had a softening
effect upon so many Re-
publicans. Such acquies-
cence in the opposition's
complaints is the tranquil-
izing drug that saps the
muscle of a party and
tends to its disintegra-
tion. Parties in a healthy
political system are there
to criticize and oppose.
The record is there. Why
should it be ignored?
*
We can all remember
the theme of the Demo-
cratic Party for two dec-
ades. It was to pillory
Herbert Hoover and to
point with fervent pride
at the recovery that fol-
lowed March 4, 1933. This
was the theme of Presi-
dents Roosevelt and Tru-
man. To this day many
Democrats are still run-
ning against former Presi-
dent Hoover.
An epochal fight is
ahead for party suprem-
acy. This is serious busi-
ness. The Republicans
need fighting spirit and
need it badly. Adams, the
hitherto meek, has grasped
the standard and held it
high.
