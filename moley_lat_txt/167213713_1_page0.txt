OLD SCHOOL 'YEAR'
TIES US UP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Integrated or segregated,
Federally supported or lo-
cally supported, we must
have school facilities to ac-
commodate our burgeon-
ing population. At the
same time, apparently, we
must anticipate creeping
inflation and higher costs
for school-building.
That excellent watch-
dog over government
spending, the Citizens Pub-
lic Expenditures Survey of
New York State, tells us
in alarming figures what
practically every State in
the Union must face this
year, and the next, and the
next, and on until some-
thing drastic is done to use
more efficiently what fa-
cilities we have.
*
For the current school
year, people in the State
of New York must spend
$1,300,000,000 for public
schools alone. That is an
increase of 10% over last
year. Last year, the sum
spent was 15% more than
the year before. This is a
pace which even a big, rich
State like New York can-
not endure for long.
Four conditions create
this growth—more chil-
dren, less for each dollar
spent in school construc-
tion, more interest on mon-
ey borrowed by School
Boards and rising teach-
ers' salaries because of
competition for good teach-
ing talent.
A New York State "edu-
cational conference," after
studying needs and means,
has estimated that the
State government must in-
crease its aid to local units
of government approxi-
mately 25% over last year.
To qualify for this aid, lo-
cal districts would have to
raise an amount which
would mean increasing the
tax rate on every dollar of
taxable property by 30%.
In the face of the grim
fact that this would be only
a part of the increased tax
bill because of higher costs
for street maintenance,
fire and police protection,
and other local necessities,
this would be an unbeara-
bly expensive luxury.
The conclusion of the
Citizens Public Expendi-
ture. Survey is exactly
what I have suggested a
number of times in these
articles-a reorganization
of the school year.
There are many possible
ways to accomplish this,
some of which have been
successfully tried. Basical-
ly, all of them would make
use of the school plant
more months of the year.
At the present time it is
estimated that the school
plant is in actual use only
about 15% of the hours in
the year. No one suggests
that this be increased to
anything like full time.
But by lengthening the
school year only a few
weeks and with adjust-
ment of the daily schedule,
perhaps by staggering the
school population, tremen-
dous economy would re-
sult.

The more common sug-
gestion is to break the year
into four quarters, with
25% of the pupils taking
their vacations in each
quarter, and with teach-
ers taking an option of
full employment or three-
quarters employment, with
salaries adjusted accord-
ingly.
Some modification of
this might be found, such
as the plan at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, where
there are four quarters
based upon an 11-month
year. September is a
month for a complete shut-
down for repairs, vaca-
tions, and other essentials
in a well-managed plant,
and provision for a breath-
er for students and facul-
ty. Public schools might
use August or some other
month for the complete
shutdown.
The old school year, a
product of rural America,
is an anachronism.
