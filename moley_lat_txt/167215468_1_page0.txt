TROOPS IN
A CITY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
BILOXI, Miss.—Biloxi, a
most interesting spot on
the Gulf Coast, has found
problems. Its experience
well illustrates what is
happening in many American
cities since our military
establishment has attained
such enormous proportions.
No American city has a
greater sense of history
and no city has a more cosmopolitan
population than
Biloxi.
It has lived under eight
flags: French, Spanish,
West Florida Republic,
Mississippi Magnolia, Confederate
States, Mississippi
State and the United
States before and after the
War Between the States.
Established in 1699, it was
the capital for a time of the
vast French Louisiana Territory,
stretching from the
Gulf to Canada. In 1722
the seat of that government
was moved to New
Orleans.
*
It felt the direct impact
of two wars, in 1812 and
in 1861-65, in addition to
several Indian affairs.
Biloxi occupies the end
of a peninsula so that its
capacity for expansion is
limited. And this is at the
root of its problems with
the Keesler Air Force
Base, located within the
city limits. Very close to
the base is a VA installation
with a very large acreage.
The community has
no problem with the VA.
The city welcomed the
air base, which originated
as a much smaller technical
installation. But when
it was greatly enlarged
(12,000 Air Force personnel)
the difficulties began.
At first the problems were
concerned with the competition
of the post exchange,
its branches and commissaries
with local merchants.
Prices of a very
wide variety of goods in
the military stores were
far, far below what private,
taxpaying enterprise
could afford. It was alleged
that there were abuses
in reselling and in sales
to unauthorized persons.
Verbal exchanges between
Mississippi members of
Congress and the
base brass were not always
productive of results. One
rather curious military
contention was that the
city stores were small and
in a congested city it was
difficult for the personnel
and family to trade in the
town. Ironically the city
had given lavishly of its
limited land space for the
base and housing developments.
*
After the Hoover Commission
reported some of
the inequities in military
competition with private
enterprise the 84th Congress
passed legislation
more strictly regulating
military stores. Since then
the problem has become
less important. Official efforts
are in evidence on
the base to put an end to
all sources of irritation. I
even saw a big sign in the
post exchange enjoining
customers: “Don’t brag
about post exchange
prices.”
Two very serious problems
of another sort have
arisen more recently. The
city is in direful need of a
through highway from
east to west to relieve
Coast Highway 90, over
which an immense
through traffic passes. The
ideal place for another
highway would be along
the edge of the air base to
accommodate the townspeople
and the military,
too. But a commandant
built a big warehouse in
the way.
*
Now there is a controversy
over a piece of land
formerly ceded by the city
to the VA and later returned
to the city. The
military took this over, at
the time to extend a long
runway. It slaughtered the
oaks thereon and then decided
that it was needed
for military housing. The
city, which wanted the site
for a school, is very unhappy
about the turn of
events and the matter may
end in the Federal courts.
American cities are
patriotic enough to welcome
and support strong
defense in this cold war
but the marriage of military
and civil life could be
improved by the various
branches of the service.
