RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nixon's Program
for Aid to Schools!
Vice-President Nixon, in
a speech at DePauw Uni-
versity in May, 1957, made
two points that deserve
emphasis. One was that a
"dedicated teacher" is en-
titled to compensation
which will enable him to
maintain the standards
which his position re-
quires."
This cannot be assured
by indiscriminate Federal
handouts to school author-
ities which may find their
way into extravagant
building programs. Great
education comes from
"dedicated teachers," not
bricks and mortar. In an
earlier article I discussed
favorably a proposal to
give teachers tax equality
by permitting them tax
deductions for outlays
made to improve their pro-
fessional training.
Nixon also said on the
same occasion:
*
"I believe that when
the fiscal situation of the
Federal government can
afford a reduction of taxes
we should give serious
consideration to vari-
ous plans which have been
suggested for allowing
tuitions and fees of both
public and private insti-
tutions to be treated as
tax deductions."
Fair-minded people can
agree with that, too—
with one reservation. The
fiscal situation can well af-
ford both of these ideas. As
I indicated, the teacher-
improvement plan would
involve $15,000,000 to $23,-
000,000. The relief-for-par-
ents plan as embodied
in the best of the pro-
posed bills on the sub-
ject would cost about $150,-
000,000. Compare this
with the hundreds of mil-
lions urged by both the
President and Vice-Presi-
dent last year for school
construction which was
unwise and unnecessary
and which the administra-
tion has now abandoned.
The best relief-for-par-
ents plan among the many
before Congress has been
sponsored by Reps. Mc-
Carthy, Boggs and others.
It was carefully worked
out in 1954 by the taxation
section of the American
Bar Association. It was
described in detail before
the House Ways and
Means Committee last
month by Vice-President
Meck of Dartmouth Col-
lege.
It would provide that
30% of the student's fees
might be used as a tax
credit on the tax bill of the
person paying the fees.
This would usually be a
parent but it could apply
to any relative, neighbor
or employer. The plan
would not discriminate
against taxpayers in low-
er brackets. A ceiling of
$450 would be placed on
the amount of the tax
credit.
Among other virtues in
this plan is the fact that
it would tend to bring out
more money for scholar-
ships.
The credit would not ap-
ply to support for the stu-
dent's expenses other than
tuition and fees. It would
not apply to food, lodging
and other expenses.
The Treasury is lending
no aid to such a plan. Nor
are those pursuing the
mirage of general tax re-
form.
★
Nor is the National Edu-
cation Association. Appar-
ently this group wants all
or nothing in the way of
aid to education.
The American Council
on Education, which in-
cludes 142 educational or-
ganizations and 1007 col-
leges, junior colleges and
universities, the Ameri-
can Alumni Council,
the Association of Ameri-
can Colleges and the State
Universities Association
are in favor of this plan.
Such a proposal involves
no question of Federal con-
trol of education, it is
relatively inexpensive and
it gives aid where aid is
needed—to the hard-
pressed taxpayer and par-
ent and the worthy stu-
dent who deserves a high-
er education.
