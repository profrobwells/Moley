CALIFORNIA
OMENS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The expected contest for
the Governorship of Cali-
fornia has loosed the per-
verted genius of an army
of punsters. Perhaps the
most accurate if not the
most provocative comment
is "Knight must fall."
The omens and oracles,
as well as the inflexible
hand of history, point to
the defeat of Gov. Goodwin
J. Knight by Sen. William
F. Knowland in 1958 if
both men enter the contest
for the Governorship.
The most recent and
most startling piece of evi-
dence on this point is a
State-wide poll conducted
for the Los Angeles Times
by Facts Consolidated.
Among the Republicans
questioned, 50% preferred
Knowland, 28% favored
Knight. The overwhelming
preference astonished even
people who had believed
that the Senator would win
such a contest. Among all
people of both parties ques-
tioned, the ratio favoring
Knowland was 46 to 31.

A major argument by
friends of Knight is that
such a contest in the pri-
mary would injure the
chances of the Republican
candidate in the sub-
sequent election. This was
put to the people inter-
viewed, and the main re-
sponse of the Republicans
was that it either would
make no difference or
would help Republican
chances in November. The
figures were that 32%
thought that a contest
would hurt Republican
chances at election, 27%
thought it would make no
difference, while 16%
thought it would help Re-
publican chances.
Since Atty. Gen. Brown
is most prominently men-
tioned as a Democratic
candidate for Governor, the
poll included a question
asking for preferences be-
tween each of the Repub-
licans and Brown. The fig-
ures show a preference for
Knowland over Brown by
46 to 31 and for Knight
over Brown by 40 to 37.

The poll shows that
Knowland would get more
Democratic support than
would Knight. This com-
pletely refutes a belief,
seemingly shared by
Knight himself, that the
big concessions made by
Knight to union leaders
would make him strong
with Democrats. Apparent-
ly these concessions, which
have alienated many Re-
publicans, have not helped
in getting Democratic
votes.
The historical precedents
are all against Knight suc-
ceeding himself. Kyle
Palmer of The Times has
pointed out that in the last
half century only two Gov-
ernors have been re-elect-
ed. These were Hiram
Johnson and Earl Warren,
each unbeatable in his re-
spective era.
After Johnson went to
the Senate, a Republican
named Stephens was elect-
ed in 1918. He was uncere-
moniously ousted by an-
other Republican named
Richardson in 1922. Then
Richardson was defeated
by another Republican,
named Young, in 1926.
Young was ousted by May-
or Rolfe of San Francisco,
a Republican who died in
office. Merriam succeeded
Rolfe, and was elected to a
full term in 1934. Olson, a
Democrat, was elected in
1938 and was defeated by
Warren in 1942. Thus, the
way of the State with its
Governors is a hard one.
*
There has been specula-
tion concerning the possi-
bility that Knight might
avoid the Governorship
race and try for the Senate
seat to be vacated by
Knowland. However, in a
statement breathing defi-
ance of those who would
use the Governorship as
a "steppingstone" to the
Presidency, Knight vows to
run, willy-nilly.
Despite the clear indica-
tion that Knowland is more
popular now, it must not
be forgotten that Knight
has distributed the favors
available to his office with
great sagacity. Moreover,
he is an indefatigable
stump speaker and his
charge that Knowland will
not serve out his term will
help him.
But the polls, portents
and precedents weigh heav-
ily against him.
