Enough hypocrisy was
revealed in the battle to
put the Hells Canyon bill
through the Senate to fill
a book.
Perhaps the greatest deceit was to give as a reason
for its passage the urgent
need of the Northwest for
power. There is no question
about the needs of that
growing region. But to
wipe out, by act of Congress, the project under
construction by the Idaho
Power Co. and substitute
a higher Federal dam
would be to defer for at
least eight years a supply
of power which, if the Idaho
company is to be permitted to complete its first
dam, will be flowing off the
generators in a year.

However, Sen. Morse all
along has perpetrated a bit
of double-talk which is almost as bad. He knows
quite well, because his own
State is largely dependent
upon private companies for
electric power, that the
preference clause governing the distribution of power
generated by Federal
projects will, to a greater
degree, give a disproportionate amount of power to
the neighboring State of
Washington.
Hence, he has been at
pains in his speeches over
the past two or three years
to tell his constituents that
they will be assured a plentiful proportion of the energy
created by the various
new Federal projects which
he advocates. In a pious
Christmas message to "fellow Oregonians" last December, on stationery fes-
tooned with holly berries
and issued from the Loyalty
Building in Portland, he
said for their reassurance
that one of his basic principles was that "private
utilities should be guaranteed a fair share of power
supply from our Federal
projects."
But on various occasions
since, he has refused to
commit himself concerning
any change in the preference law.
In his Hells Canyon bill,
introduced in the Senate
"for himself" and 26 other
Democratic Senators and
one misguided Republican
named Wiley, there is this
promise to the State of
Idaho:
"In order to facilitate the
development of the Central
and Upper Snake River
Basin (the most populous
part of Idaho and a barren
fringe of Eastern Oregon)
... 500,000 kilowatts (of a
total of 900,000) ... shall
be made available for use
in Central and Upper Snake
River Basin and to all other
parts of Idaho lying outside the Central and Upper
Snake River Basin."
That was to give the
Morse proteges in Idaho,
Rep. Pfost. and Sen.
Church something with
which to beguile their fellow citizens.
*
The passage above is
taken from Section 3A of
the bill. But in Section 3B
it is provided that "electrical energy available from
Hells Canyon Dam
shall be marketed by the
Secretary in accordance
with Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 and 7 of the Bonneville
Project Act of 1937..."
The act to which reference is made definitely contains the preference
clauses, which means that
in case public power agencies and co-operatives in
Washington and elsewhere
do not demand the kilowatts, Idaho—dependent
upon private power—can
have them.
Thus Morse giveth and
Morse taketh in the same
section of his bill.
