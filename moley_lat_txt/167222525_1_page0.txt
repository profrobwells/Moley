FINANCIAL
FOLLY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

OKLAHOMA CITY â€” I
am finding a great deal of
interest in attending the
annual meeting of the
Oklahoma Public Expendi-
tures Council. The secre-
tary and moving spirit of
this organization of cit-
izens is Steve Stahl, who,
almost more than anyone
else, stimulated the tax-
payers' revolt last year and
checked the attempt to
pass a poorly conceived
school-construction bill in
the last session of Con-
gress.
These taxpayers' groups,
close to the grass roots,
provide the most effective
check we have against the
headlong rush to spending
in the nation and the
States.
The principal speaker at
this meeting was Herbert
Miller, executive director
of the Tax Foundation, an
organization dedicated to
sound fiscal policies in the
States and nation and to
stimulating and helping
many taxpayers' organiza-
tions. The message that
Miller brought from Wash-
ington was the most alarm-
ing we have yet received
in any of the scattered re-
ports that have come out
since this Congressional
session began. The budget
submitted by the President
only two short months ago,
he said, is as dead as the
reckonings of an ancient
Egyptian Pharaoh.
That budget, based upon
an optimistic estimate of
tax receipts for the present
calendar year, predicted
nothing like the situation
now facing us.
In contrast with an esti-
mate in the President's
budget of a surplus of
$100,000,000 in the current
two-year period of fiscal
1958-1959, it now looks like
a two-billion-dollar deficit
in the fiscal year ending in
June, 1958, and in fiscal
1959 at least a $3,500,000,-
000 deficit, even if the cur-
rent recession rebounds
this year.
*
But the Sputnik and the
decline in business have
stimulated hysterical
moves in both Congress
and the administration to
attempt to spend us out of
recession. Miller said: "If
the bulk of new and ex-
panded spending proposals
now before Congress
should by any chance be
approved, it could mean
a first-year appropriation
increase of as much as 10
billion dollars, with large
additional amounts for fu-
ture spending. On this
huge amount, not more
than one-third might be
for national security pro-
grams."
Miller further pointed
out that for the first time
in our history the govern-
ment is seeking to use Fed-
eral spending to support
simultaneously a cold war
abroad and an economic
recession at home. More-
over, for the first time in
the memory of Americans
we are in for recession and
mounting unemployment
while at the same time we
are going to have no de-
flation in price levels. On
the contrary, we are fac-
ing the unprecedented
prospect of inflation and
recession at the same time.
In view of this, the in-
crease of Congressional au-
thority for a debt ceiling
of 280 billion dollars is a
vain hope. The better fig-
ure for debt ceiling in the
not-too-distant future
would be nearer 290 bil-
lion dollars or 300 billion
dollars.
It should be emphasized
that State and local ex-
penditures will also rise.
There will probably be in
the next two years, if
present trends continue,
an increase altogether of
something like 20 billion
dollars in State, local and
Federal expenditures.
*
Meanwhile, the pros-
pects of Federal income
must not be estimated at
more than the current 70-
odd billion dollars a year.
No more can be squeezed
out of our economy.
The proposals now be-
fore Congress, born of this
hysteria, run between 16
billion dollars and 20 bil-
lion dollars more than the
President estimated in
January. Meanwhile, we
hear of a tax cut. But a tax
cut without corresponding
reductions in spending is
a fool's device. The result
is inflation, uncontrolled
and indeterminate.
