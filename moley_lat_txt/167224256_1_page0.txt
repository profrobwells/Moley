RAYMOND MOLEY:
Tax Reduction as
Antirecession Move
The statement by Vice-
President Nixon that a tax
cut would be the first ad-
ministration move in its
fight against the recession,
the repudiation of this
idea by the administration,
and Nixon's subsequent
qualification of his predic-
tion reflect the confusion
in the official family con-
cerning what should real-
ly be done. Once more we
see the ordeal that the
Vice-President endures
when he is trying to inter-
pret confusion without
leadership. It is like try-
ing to make a music score
for a traffic jam.

Hence, in the public
prints there appear all
sorts of privately advanced
plans, criticisms, opinions
and nostrums. As always,
economists are rushing
into the papers with round
robins, including some
fairly well known names.
To say that these repre-
sent the collective thought
of American economists is
absurd. For there is no
such thing as a consensus
of economists' beliefs. Al-
most any professor can
write a plan and, after cir-
culating it among the
members of the American
Economic Association, get
enough signers to make
the headlines.
The Committee for Eco-
nomic Development comes
out with a statement ad-
vocating tax cuts and no
reduction in spending.
*
Then the industrial un-
ion department of the
AFL-CIO comes out with
more of what Master
Reuther has been saying
all the time.
And, finally, there are
as many plans in Congress
as there are members.
A close examination of
the ideas in just one Sun-
day paper makes it clear
that there is a sharp dis-
tinction between two
schools of tax-cutters, not
only as to the form that
reductions should take but
the results anticipated
thereby.
One school admits, by
inference at least, not only
that deficit financing and
inflation are expected in a
tax cut, but that such a tax
cut would cause bene-
ficiaries to spend their own
money. This really means
that since a big deficit
would result in the in-
crease of money not only
in the hands of taxpayers
but in the number of dol-
lars actually in existence,
inflation would be inevi-
table. Thus people would
rush to buy things be-
cause they would be afraid
that much higher prices
would come shortly after.
This is simply a way of
scaring money out of the
pockets of the American
people. It is hardly a way
to create confidence of the
value of people's money.
And, as always, the blow
would fall upon the savers,
the fixed-income groups,
including pensioners, and
others. But the AFL-CIO's
industrial union depart-
ment calls this "the road
to confidence."
My space does not per-
mit the elaboration of the
plain fact that a few dol-
lars more for each tax-
payer after taxes would
have a negligible effect
upon the economy as a
whole. Millions would
simply hoard the little
nugget with other savings
on the theory that a dol-
lar, even a 50-cent dollar,
is better than nothing.

The contrast in views
held by those who would
cut taxes is well illustrat-
ed by the IUD and by Dr.
Arthur F. Burns, former
head of the President's
economic advisers. The
former holds that tax cuts
and more spending would
be useful in getting many
programs under way that
are "needed" in the indefi-
nite future. Burns holds
that such cuts should be
permanent and would have
the sound effect of check-
ing spending this year and
in years to come. In short,
Burns sees a cut as a
means of bringing the lev-
el of the budget down by
several billion or so.
All, however, admit a
very important truth by
inference. Their belief that
a tax cut would be wise
means also that they be-
lieve a part of the reces-
sion's cause is high taxes.
This is what a small mi-
nority of conservatives
have been saying a long
time. For when taxes take
away a large part of the
people's income, the peo-
ple have less to spend.
