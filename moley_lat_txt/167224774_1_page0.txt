SHOCKING
GAME
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Recent utterances by
Clyde T. Ellis, general
manager of the National
Rural Electrification, Co-
operative Association, in-
dicate that his pressure or-
ganization, which original-
ly found a means of living
by exploiting farmers'
need for electricity, now
seeks to perpetuate itself
by exploiting a new part
of the population which
lives in exurbia.
He is proving, once
more, two of the most un-
fortunate characteristics of
our political and govern-
mental life. First is the
fact that the political out-
fits created for the purpose
of getting aid for farmers
outlive the alleged needs
which gave them birth.
And, second, that a bu-
reaucratic governmental
institution created for an
emergency lives on after
the emergency is past.
Thus, the pressure group
without and the agency
within the government
join in finding new ways
of perpetuating themselves
when old slogans fail.

Rural electrifica-
tion originated in the lusty
youth of the New Deal. It
was a device which, by
means of government sub-.
sidies, extended electric
service to farming areas
which were so sparsely set-
tled that private compa-
nies were unable to pro-
vide service.
Back there in the begin-
ning of the REA, Ellis
says, only 10% of the na-
tion's farms were getting
central station electricity,
but the amount that is
used by each farm is grow-
ing. Again citing Ellis,
consumption of electricity
has increased from 900,-
000,000 kilowatt-hours in
1941 to an estimated 21
billion in 1957.
Another reason for the
fear of Ellis that his Op-
eration Uplift may be near-
ing its demise is the ebbing
potential of farm politics.
Eighteen months ago I
made the point that the Ei-
senhower regime need not
fear the political danger of
farm unrest. This was not
because the farmers' gripes
were not a reality or not
because the political ex-
ploitation of those gripes
would not be vehement. I
made the point, backed
with some figures, that
there were not enough sur-
viving farmers seriously to
threaten the President's
re-election.
â˜…
The dropping of only a
handful of Congressional
seats in the November
election showed that this
estimate was right.
Ellis admits this is cit--
ing a recent statement of
our politically alert Vice-
President that "when he
came to Washington 11
years ago about 300 mem-
bers of the House had to
pay attention to the farm
needs and the farm vote."
Now, according to the
Vice-President, only about
100 are directly affected by
the farm vote. I might call
attention to the some-
what cynical inference that
unless "need" is accom-
panied by "vote," states-
men are not greatly con-
cerned.
But Ellis is going to
hunt for votes elsewhere.
"We must keep in mind,"
he said, "that the rural
electrification program is
the child creature of poli-
tics-not partisan politics,
but politics." Hence, his
conclusion that only as his
organization succeeds in
"keeping our consumer
members supplied with...
low-cost electricity" can
his political influence be
maintained.
*
Broadly paraphrased,
this means that the mobil-
ization of votes must go
hand in hand-or shall I
say hand in pockets-with
getting something for
nothing from the govern-
ment. The Ellis organiza-
tion, it claims, has suc-
ceeded in getting tax ex-
emption and 2% money for
expansion from a govern-
ment that must pay be-
tween 3 and 4%. This sub-
sidy attracts votes. But to
continue to get the money
to attract the votes, some
heroic effort is essential to
mobilize voters.
Hence, Ellis proposes to
create a rural electric min-
ute-man program to drum
up a demand for subsi-
dized electricity in the
new nonfarm population
of rural areas. Thus we
shall see a drive for Social-
ism in exurbia.
