A LONELY
BATTLE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Little note is being giv-
en a development which
should make proud one of
the President's earliest ap-
pointees, Felix Edgar
Wormser of New York,
who served as Assistant
Secretary of the Interior.
He assumed office at a
time when no one around
Washington expected any
new men to accomplish
policy changes in the
overgrown bureaucracy.
The State Department
and other sectors of a
sprawling government
were a bewildering jungle
through which even the
natives knew no path, a
tangle that might be pene-
trated only by ax, machete
and bulldozer.
*
In 1954 Wormser faced
dangers to the freedom of
our economy which were
very real. These had to do
with international raw-
material agreements nego-
tiated by our foreign ser-
vice bureaucracy. Already
the international wheat
agreement had cost the
United States $600,000,000.
Tin and rubber were up
for consideration. Artifi-
cially high support prices
would be established for
producers of these com-
modities, export quotas set
and a pool for each main-
tained to take up surplus
production. The State De-
partment was determined
to go along with certain
tin-producing countries on
an international tin agree-
ment which would have
cost Americans, particular-
ly housewives, about $45,-
000,000 a year.
Largely by Wormser's
persuasion the Treasury
Department and the De-
partment of Commerce sid-
ed with his and Interior's
stand. The case was argued
before a large group of
businessmen at the De-
partment of Commerce,
where Wormser won his
points against the State
Department's representa-
tive. Among those points
were that "stabilizing the
world tin market," largely
at U.S. expense, was a de-
nial of the fundamental
principle of allowing sup-
ply and demand to deter-
mine the world price of tin
(something that eventual-
ly would prevail), that
U.S. participation without
Congressional approval
was an intrusion by the
State Department into our
domestic economy and that
basically the scheme was
unsound.
Now we see the wisdom
of Wormser's position. In
London the International
Tin Council, which has
been trying to achieve its
untenable objectives for
five years, shows signs of
falling apart. As in the
wheat agreement, when a
nation sees it to be to its
interest to pull out, the
structure collapses.
*
With tin glutting the
market as a result of the
failure of the "buffer pool"
to absorb the surplus,"
Malaya due to exceed her
export quota," Russia ex-
porting tin and U.S. de-
mand diminishing, it is
probably just a matter of
time before this interna-
tional cartel fails.
Wormser's stand on
principle, which dictates
that a free market should
be encouraged, is thus
justified.
He has also the rare sat-
isfaction of knowing that
views he urged in 1954
have been adopted in the
State Department. At the
recent Buenos Aires eco-
nomic conference with
other Latin American
countries, Assistant Secre-
tary of State Roy Rubot-
tom made the following
observation:
â˜…
"Among the measures
most often mentioned for
attempting to stabilize
such commodity prices are
intergovernmental com-
modity agreements. While
the United States fully
recognizes that many
countries rely heavily
upon exports of primary
products and do face spe-
cial problems in the form
of relatively wide fluctua-
tions in the world market
prices for some of their
major products, it does not
believe that the cure is to
be found in mechanisms
for international price sup-
port or stabilization.
"In the view of the
United States, there is too
strong a probability that
such a cure would be at
least as harmful as the
disease. In general, it is the
conviction of the United
States that maximum reli-
ance upon competitive
forces in free markets will
best promote international
price relationships condu-
cive to optimum allocation
of economic resources and
the advancement of eco-
nomic welfare."
