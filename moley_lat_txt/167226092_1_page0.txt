A SIGNIFICANT VETO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is probable that no
Presidential veto since
President Cleveland's re-
fusal to approve pension
bills in his first adminis-
tration has greater signifi-
cance than Mr. Eisenhow-
er's exposure of the $1,
704,028,300 rivers and har-
bors omnibus. Authoriza-
tion bills of this kind,
passed by politically hun-
gry Congresses under the
prodding of local interests,
have assumed scandalous
proportions.
The rivers and harbors
racket goes back into the
distant past, and one of
the reasons a Presidential
budget was established
was to prevent just this
sort of action by Congress.
In this case, the Presi-
dent turned the barrel up-
side down and exposed the
pork piece by piece. To
begin with, he pointed out
the patent dishonesty of
the claim that this author-
ization bill could possibly
have any effect on the
present recession, even if
any public works bill
could accomplish that end.
Under similar bills there
is a backlog of public
works projects estimated
at 5 billion dollars.

To indicate how many
projects that are author-
ized in pork-barrel legisla-
tion are unnecessary and
perhaps never built, a
chief of Army Engineers
told a committee a few
years ago that his organi-
zation separated the al-
ready-authorized projects
into three classes: one-
third were works that
were either under way or
should be undertaken im-
mediately, one-third were
projects that could be de-
layed, perhaps indefinite-
ly, and one-third were
totally unnecessary proj-
ects which the Army En-
gineers could not recom-
mend at all. This rule
would probably apply to
the vetoed 1958 bill.
Specifically, the Presi-
dent pointed out that in a
good many of these proj-
ects the alleged benefits
to the community were
not compensated for by
contributions from the lo-
cal governments. This has
to do with what are known
in government language
as benefit-cost ratios. In
much of the bureaucratic
bookkeeping the benefits
are either problematical
in size or are impossible
to put into figures. On the
other hand, the costs are
in actual dollars spent. To
be blunt, the President
vetoed these bills on the
ground that if the benefits
are so great to a commu-
nity, it ought to pay a rea-
sonable part of the cost.
He is calling the bluff of
the local interests that
clamor for these projects.

Another large group of
projects proposed by Con-
gress, amounting to more
than $100,000,000, has
been condemned by the
Army Engineers them-
selves as of no economic
value. One of the small but
absurd items was an ap-
propriation for a small-
boat harbor, in spite of the
fact that adequate harbors
were located nearby.
Another batch of items
was payments for alleged
damages in certain in-
stances where it had al-
ready been determined
that there was no merit in
the claims.
Another group had to
do with municipal and in-
dustrial water-supply
shortage, without any
standards for payment of
an appropriate share of
the costs by water con-
sumers. Even reclamation
projects, many of which
are not justified, do re-
quire, on paper at least,
payment by the users.

It begins to look as if
President Eisenhower,
serving his last term and
ineligible for re-election,
intends to strike out with
genuine courage at these
raids on the public treas-
ury. Nothing could inspire
confidence in this country
more than such action by
him.
It is to be hoped that he
will take the same attitude
if and when the billion-
dollar bill for public works
is passed. For this also
reeks with politics, sugar-
coated by the false justi-
fication that such projects
can possibly get under
way in time to help em-
ployment now.
