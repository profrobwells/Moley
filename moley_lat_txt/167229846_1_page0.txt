RAYMOND MOLEY:
New Federal Loan
Scheme Proposed
A group, including some
of our most profligate
Senators, are pushing a
radical scheme which only
the Federal government
could be expected to en-
dure. For it prompts the
Federal government to
sponsor and underwrite
"national investment com-
panies" to make capital
more readily available for
financing small businessâ€”
in other words to advance
taxpayers' money to in-
dividuals or businesses
who for perhaps very good
reasons are unable to se-
cure desired credit in their
own communities or
States.
After approval, should
this legislation pass Con-
gress, a company must ac-
quire a paid-in capital and
surplus of $5,000,000, sub-
scribed in whole or in part
by Federal Reserve banks.
The pivotal feature of the
idea is Federal participa-
tion.

But the financing of
small business with equity
capital is a very difficult
and extremely tricky
phase of financing. Ex-
perts in the field of finance
emphasize that the best
and most logical method
of building a structure of
companies to finance busi-
nesses which may have
difficulty in borrowing
funds is first to encourage
local development corpora-
tions, then build on that
foundation State develop-
ment corporations.
Already State develop-
ment corporations are ac-
tive in Maine, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecti-
cut, New York and North
Carolina. Others are au-
thorized in Arkansas,
Georgia, Michigan, South
Dakota, Wisconsin and
Vermont. Legislation is
pending in other States,
among them Florida, Min-
nesota, Mississippi, Mon-
tana, New Jersey, South
Carolina and West Vir-
ginia.
State corporations have
a technique of operation
far superior to the pro-
posed national investment
companies. Where the cap-
ital is subscribed, a State
corporation may call on all
banks in the. State for a
pro-rata participation in
a given loan, normally 2%
of capital and surplus. Al-
though the lending activ-
ity of State corporations
is brisk, thus far it is far
below the potential call
on member lending institu-
tions. Such a sound solu-
tion is not to be gained
by legislation now pend-
ing in Congress.
The Federal government
could best exercise its in-
fluence by permitting the
Small Business Adminis-
tration to make loans di-
rectly to State and local
development corporations
regardless of the size of
the beneficiary.
Contributions to the
paid-in capital and surplus
of development corpora-
tions could be given spe-
cial tax treatment, since
special risk is involved
and they may be consid-
ered in the public interest
this would obviate the
need for any contributions
by Federal Reserve banks.
*
Experience has shown
that in the case of State
and local development
corporations where the
capital of private corpora-
tions and individuals is in-
volved and where funds
are raised from State and
local banking institutions
and where the evaluation
is made by persons famil-
iar with local business, the
situation is such that the
investment risk can be
very carefully sifted. Un-
der such circumstances,
the course of discretion is
to give much further in-
tensive study to the estab-
lishment of national in-
vestment companies and
meanwhile to strengthen
Federal measures to en-
courage private, State and
local credit pools.
