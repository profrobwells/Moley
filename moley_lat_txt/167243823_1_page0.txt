TVA'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
While the Tennessee
Valley Authority is cele-
brating its silver anniver-
sary, it may be well to con-
sider a very important
financial aspect which con-
cerns every taxpayer in
the United States, as well
as every beneficiary of that
institution.
Just what is the status
of the investment that the
United States as a whole
has made in the TVA in
the course of its quarter-
century of life?
This investment, if that
is what it is to be called,
according to a report of the
Comptroller General of the
United States covering the
fiscal year 1957 is about
2 billion dollars. The gov-
ernment's equity in the
power assets of the TVA is
approximately $1,614,000,
000.
*
On this outlay from the
U.S. government, no in-
terest is or has been paid.
The law specifies this ex-
emption. Under the Gov-
ernment Corporations Ap-
propriation Act of 1948
the TVA should pay $87,-
000,000 into the U.S. Treas-
ury during the 10-year
period ending June 30 of
this year, and an equiva-
lent amount during each
10-year period following
until about $350,000,000
has been paid. It is also re-
quired that new Congres-
sional appropriations for
power facilities be repaid
over a period not to exceed
40 years after the facili-
ties go into operation.
The TVA makes a very
large profit on power sales,
but stands a loss on many
other activities. The net is
still very large. Comp-
troller General Campbell
says in the report to which
I referred:
"Therefore, we are con-
tinuing our recommenda-
tions that the authority be
directed to pay interest on
the investment of Federal
funds allocated to power,
including construction in
progress and investiga-
tions for future projects,
at a rate adequate to re-
imburse the U.S. Treasury
for cost of providing funds
and, if necessary for the
sound conduct of the pow-
er program, that the statu-
tory repayment require-
ment be modified."
There are two quite dif-
ferent ways of characteriz-
ing the status of the Unit-
ed States so far as its so-
called "investment" in the
project is concerned. One
is that the United States is
a creditor. If that be true,
then the TVA is a very de-
linquent, not to say a bad,
debtor. Another character-
ization of the relationship
is that the United States is
a stockholder or investor.
If that be true, it is a neg-
lected stockholder and an
unfortunate investor.
If the Kerr bill, which
would permit the TVA to
issue its own securities,
should be finally passed
and approved by the Presi-
dent (it has already passed
the Senate), the United
States will no longer be the
sole investor. There will be
private individuals who
have bought the securities
on the ground that there
are ample "profits" to cov-
er the investment and to
pay interest. Then, under
the present law, the United
States will be relegated to
an inferior status as com-
pared with the new inves-
tors. This is a strange way
to compensate the taxpay-
ers of the United States
who gave so generously in
days when the Tennessee
Valley was in dire need.
