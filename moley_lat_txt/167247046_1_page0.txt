A BEST SELLER THAT DESERVES TO BE ONE
It is a good sign that J.
Edgar Hoover's book
"Masters of Deceit" has
moved up to third place in
the best-sclier list in the
month since it was pub-
lished. For it shows a
warm public response to a
subject which must never
be taken lightly: The ulti-
mate determination of
Communists not only to
destroy our institutions
but to dominate the world.
There has been a dis-
turbing trend in American
opinion of late. It is the
growing disposition of
many of us who are weary
of tension to regard the
problem of coexistence
lightly and to accept with
at least a moderate dis-
count the seductive mur-
murs of the sleek Khru-
shchev. We haven't got to
the point of embracing
him. And certainly we
know he needs no pity. But
some of us are prone to
endure and perhaps he-
lieve him. Hoover con-
vinces any reasonable
reader of his book that our
vigil should never be re-
laxed.

In Hoover's comments
regarding those who were
deluded into turning to
Communism in the. 1930s
he lays down two great
tenets of Hebraic and
Christian ethic. The one is
that it is human to err. But
the second, inexorable con-
dition is atonement. The
moral obligation, Hoover
says, is "help the United
States." This, however,
does not conform to the at-
titude of some mushy
"liberals" concerning those
who skulk behind the Fifth
Amendment.
These people compound
their folly and sin. They
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
have grievously erred and
have done their bit, how-
ever small, to undermine
their own nation's securi-
ty. Then, in spurning
atonement, they are guilty
of the moral offense of dis-
loyalty. They refuse to
help their country in its
need to protect itself.
Hoover's chapters on
"Who Are the Commu-
nists?" (in the United
States) and "The Commu-
nist Front" should con-
vince anyone that there
lies more peril in a dupe
than in 20 rogues.
It is interesting to re-
flect upon the fact, not re-
vealed in this book, that
the year 1933 marked the
greatest ordeal of Hoover
himself and the greatest
threat to his FBI, as well
as the beginning of his real
J. Edgar Hoover
tussle with the Communist
conspiracy.
When the Roosevelt ad-
ministration took office in
the spring of 1933, a tre-
mendous drive began to
displace Hoover and to put
some "deserving" Demo-
crat in the job. The White
House was assailed by all
sorts of accusations against
the FBI chief, mostly be-
plinarian. A number of
hack police chiefs over the
country and the political
bosses who controlled
them were on the prowl for
the Hoover job. Fortunate-
ly, Roosevelt was prevailed
upon to hold off a while.
Meanwhile, Homer Cum-
mings became Attorney
General and before long
was one of Hoover's
strongest supporters.

Later in that year, in
November, the President
was induced to recognize
the Soviet Union, and the
slick Litvinov convinced
him that the Soviets were
friendly to us and that
there would be no more es-
pionage in the United
States.
This was utter non-
sense because after that
day, as Hoover points out,
the Communist Party
U.S.A. grew rapidly. In
1930 it had 7500 members.
But by 1933 it had jumped
to 30,000, and it had 80,000
in 1944. So neither the
moist palm of friendship
in 1933 nor the joining of
our arms with theirs in
war halted their determi-
nation to poison our body
politic and destroy us.
Nor, as Hoover says, has
the intent slackened even
after the party, bereft of its
leadership, dwindled to a
handful. It has merely
gone into hiding and, while
unseen, its tentacles reach
many parts of American
life.

have said, wish to teach
students about Commu-
nism, here is a text by our
greatest expert on the sub-
ject.
