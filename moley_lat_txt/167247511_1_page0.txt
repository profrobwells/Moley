Walter Reuther's long-
term plans for building a
powerful political machine
seem, for the moment at
least, to be justified by
success.
Apparently they took
shape when he returned
23 years ago from his so-
journ in continental Eu-
rope. They were, first, the
penetration of the labor
movement by a small, com-
pact, dedicated minority;
then the acquisition of cap-
tive money and manpower
through the union shop.
After that, the penetration
of the flabby Democratic
Party in selected States by
another minority of his
union forces.
In an interview with a
British newspaperman
which appeared over here
in the New Republic in
July, he tells of what he
sees ahead.
He admits that automa-
tion in industry will mean
a decline in union mem-
berships. But to offset that,
he would press for the or-
ganization of clerical and
other white-collar workers.
He recognizes that the
great mechanical "brains"
are displacing clerical
workers, but solaces him-
self by asserting that
shrinking job opportuni-
ties will result in those
workers "organizing to
protect themselves."
It is hard to follow his
logic here. For if automa-
tion is destined to shrink
the power of industrial
unionism, how can it be
assumed that unionism
will increase in the white-
collar field where it has
only a frail beginning
now?
As far as industrial
workers are concerned,
he speaks of the decline in
what has been called "the
instinct of workmanship."
No one gets a "sense of
creative achievement"
making Cadillacs, he says.
Workers are "being
starved" by machinery. In
this respect his philosophy
follows that which was hi-
lariously depicted by Char-
lie Chaplin's movie, "Mod-
ern Times."
And so, to check the
starvation, the creative in-
stinct must be channeled
into what he calls "crea-
tive leisure."
It is a pity that the man
who was asking the ques-
tions failed to suggest that
if the way were open to
factory workers to pro-
gress up through the ranks
of foremen into the man-
agement group, there
would be sufficient incen-
tive to stimulate the
"starved" creatures mak-
ing Cadillacs. It would be
interesting to pin the ques-
tion on the CIO-UAW head
whether union rules and
practices are not in them-
selves standing in the way
of such opportunities.
If the policies of union-
ism create a sort of class
war between workers and
management, with empha-
sis on standard returns for
the efficient and inefficient
alike, there is little chance
for outlet for the ambi-
tious.
Reuther gets himself in-
to a difficult corner when
he advocates more and
more money for education
which will teach people to
play and at the same time
advocates, as he does in
this interview, that the
United States should help
India by providing great
quantities of machinery to
move earth, and build
dams, highways and trans-
portation facilities. Isn't
the net of what he is say-
ing that we should adopt a
policy of scarcity for our-
selves, while we keep on
working for our friends—
warm, lukewarm and cold
—abroad?
And if his solution is to
turn from educating for
workmanship to training
people to enjoy more and
more leisure, how are we
ever to prevail in a world
contest with nations that
are working harder and
harder, with more and
more to work with?
