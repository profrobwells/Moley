RECESSION
FALLACIES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The best news coming
out of Washington for a
long time is the indication
from the President. Economic
Adviser Hauge,
and Treasury Secretary
Anderson that there will
be a good look at the
economy before any anti-
recession program is
adopted, either through a
big public works program
or by hasty tax cutting.
Democratic members of
Congress in considerable
numbers will clamor for
them for perfectly obvious
political reasons.
First, a public works
program will serve as a
pork barrel for local advantage
to certain Congressmen and
Senators. It
will make small difference
next fall whether an authorized
project is under
way or will get under way
for months. It is sufficient
for a politician to tell the
home folks that he has
gotten them a slice of the
pie.

The advantage of a dam
or highway or bridge is at
the site, because it brings
money into the specific
community. The indirect
employment that results
from the production of
materials would go elsewhere,
perhaps hundreds
of miles away.
The stark fact is that,
despite the number of
economists and politicians
who believe that a public
works program would materially
affect a sinking
economy, the fact has
never been proven.
A revealing bit appears
in the "Secret Diary of
Harold Ickes" under date
of Sept. 13, 1935. This was
more than two years after
the 1933 works legislation
had authorized spending
3.3 billion dollars, and
Ickes had been given the
job of spending it. Ickes
was then in the midst of
his long feud with Harry
Hopkins, who had ideas
about spending other than
for stopping a recession.
★
Ickes wrote: "No one
has been able to mention
indirect employment to
the President for a long
time. He simply has no
patience with the thought."
Hopkins has finally convinced
him that the goal
ought to be put men to
work, regardless of what
they are being put to work
at, and if there is no legitimate
work, to put them to
work notwithstanding."
This means two things:
first, that Roosevelt was
no believer in the theory
of indirect employment,
and, second, that the whole
Hopkins operation was
making jobs at anything,
regardless, simply as a
stopgap relief measure.
And there is a world of
difference between make-
work and pump priming.
The fact is that Roosevelt
never believed in
pump priming, apparently,
until late in his second
term, if then. In 1933 he
opposed it and yielded to
the $3,300,000,000 appropriation
only after his
crafty mind had planned
to put Ickes at its head.
Ickes, he knew, would be
slow and suspicious in
spending it.
★
A simple formula like
pump priming with its
connotation of indirect employment,
even if it had
some relevance to a single
recession, should not in
all common sense be applied
in every recession.
For every recession differs
in nature from every other.
This one has several
characteristics peculiar
only to itself. In the first
place, there is or has been
falling employment along
with inflationary prices.
In the second place, the
distressed areas are not in
the spots where public
works would be likely to
be built. No one thinks of
building a dam in Detroit.
There is also the astonishing
fact that life insurance
and savings are rising.
This proves that
there is money to spend,
billions more than any
possible government appropriation
would provide.
Perhaps the administration
has come around to
believing that the way to
loosen this money already
in the hands of people is
to give them confidence in
the future soundness of
their country's credit and
the wisdom of the people
who are running it.
