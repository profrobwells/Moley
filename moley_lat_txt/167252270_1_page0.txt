James A. Farley has
been in the business of
foreign trade for Coca-Cola
for 18 years. When he re-
linquished the chairman-
ship of the Democratic
committee in 1940 he was
known mostly as a very
smart and successful po-
litical manager. But from
boyhood he had been in
business and knew his way
in trade. There is nothing
essentially inconsistent be-
tween business and politi-
cal management. Both are
management of men and
are concerned with human
behavior. In the interests
of his party he traveled
and learned.
Now, with 70 around the
corner, he has also trav-
eled the pathways of the
world. And he has learned
things that Americans both
in government and in for-
eign trade might well
heed.

Recently he made a
speech at a world trade
dinner that rose far above
the usual platitudes about
"world peace through
world trade" and "trade
not aid." The meat of his
message was this:
"We, of all people,
should recognize that pri-
vate, competitive, free cap-
ital can do most jobs in
foreign lands more effec-
tively, more quickly than
can otherwise be the case.
(Farley no doubt meant
"than the government.")
We have not established
the conditions that would
accelerate the flow of cap-
ital. To provide those
conditions our govern-
ment should... make cer-
tain changes necessary to
induce the maximum flow
of private capital to those
countries which create and
maintain fair standards of
reception to foreign capital
investment."
Such changes should be
by legislation or treaties.
These changes should,
according to Farley, be as
follows:.
1-Foreign operations of
American interests should
be exempted from the laws
of the United States except
stockholders, thus increas-
ing the amount of capital
available for foreign in-
vestment.
3-Since taxes abroad
sometimes fluctuate there
should be a credit here for
carry-forward or carry-
back.
4-When foreign gov-
ernments waive or reduce
taxes to attract American
capital we should reduce
our taxes accordingly. If
this is not done the benefit
of such friendly foreign
concessions is nullified.
This constructive advice
from Farley has received
a warm response editorial-
ly and otherwise.

Notable among Farley's
responses is a letter from
the president of the Amer-
ican Bar Association,
Charles S. Rhyne, who
says that the ABA has un-
der consideration the fram-
ing of a code to cover these
points. Such a code would
include a provision that
any foreign country which
nationalizes American
property without fair com-
as their products are pro- pensation should have its
duced abroad and returned
to commerce here.
2-Taxes, a heavy bur-
den on foreign investment,
should be overhauled.
Specifically with refer-
ence to taxes, Farley rec-
ommended:
1-In no case should
American companies be re-
quired to pay American
taxes when their foreign
taxes equal or exceed the
presently applicable tax
here.
2-Give American inves-
tors the right to defer tax-
es here until profits are
distributed to American
assets here frozen. This
would, Rhyne believes,
force most of the free na-
tions under such a code,
presumably through a
multilateral treaty.
It is about time to quit
wringing hands about the
lack of international trade
and to take steps to assure
the safety of such trade.
Farley's formula would
provide a practical pro-
gram. No amount of gov-
ernment giveaway could
be a substitute for such
private action with real
backing from the govern-
ment.
