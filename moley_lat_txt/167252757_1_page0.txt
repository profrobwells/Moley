Communists Get New
Cause to Rejoice
A few days ago a de-
cision by the United States
Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia gave
cause for celebration in
Communist and Commu-
nist-front circles, alarm in
the Justice Department
and its FBI, and genuine
concern in the present ses-
sion of Congress.
For the court applied
the Supreme Court's con-
troversial decision in the
Jencks case to an admin-
istrative proceeding, spe-
cifically the deliberations
of the Subversive Activi-
ties Control Board. Last
June, the Supreme Court
ruled that the defense
must be given direct ac-
cess to reports made to the
FBI by a witness sum-
moned by the government
in a criminal trial, main-
taining that only the de-
fense counsel can decide
as to the value of reports
made by FBI agents or in-
formers who are testifying.
The Jencks decision by
Justice Brennan, with
Chief Justice Warren and
Justices Black, Douglas
and Frankfurter concur-
ring, was bitterly attacked
at the time. Clinton E.
Jencks, convicted for per-
jury for signing a non-Com-
munist affidavit, appealed,
pleading that the District
Court judge screen reports
as to their relevance and
competence and turn over
appropriate documents for
the defense to use in cross-
examining witnesses.
Justice Burton made the
point that the court ma-
jority "goes beyond the re-
quest (of Jencks) that re-
ports be produced for ex-
amination by the trial
court and, in effect, seems
to hold that the govern-
ment waives any privileges
it may have with respect
to documents in its posses-
sion..."
Justice Clark wrote a
burning dissent, saying
that law-enforcement
agencies might as well
"close up shop, for the
court has opened their
files to the criminal and
thus afforded him a Roman
holiday for rummaging
through confidential infor-
mation as well as vital na-
tional secrets." FBI Direc-
tor Hoover was embit-
tered.
The latest action by the
Court of Appeals in the
seven-year-old Communist
Party registration case
sends the case back for a
second time to the Subver-
sive Activities Control
Board, instructing the
board to have the govern-
ment produce and turn
over to lawyers for the
Communist Party FBI doc-
uments relating to the tes-
timony of Mrs. Mary Stal-
cup Markward, an agent
for the FBI inside the par-
ty from 1943 to 1949.
Should the government
feel strongly about pro-
duction of FBI reports,
presumably it could move
to strike Mrs. Markward's
testimony. But if her tes-
timony is essential, a se-
vere. blow to the Internal
Security Act of 1950 might
be involved.
House and Senate re-
ports considering the act
emphasized the need for
bringing Communist or-
ganizations out into the
open through registration
requirements. The Com-
munist Party case is the
first case heard by the
board and is regarded as
"the foundation case and
the test case in the courts
as to whether the law is
constitutional." And all
other cases brought before
the board rest upon the
finding by the board.
To offset certain impll-
cations of the Jencks de-
cision, Congress passed
legislation in September
which, in substance, pro-
vides that production of
documents should only be
required after the witness
has testified.
Now it is up to the At-
torney General and the
Justice Department to de-
cide whether to release
FBI reports, either confi-
dential or privileged, in
the hope of clinching the
case against the Commu-
nist Party, or to protect
its system of security,
turn over no papers to at-
torneys and possibly cut
the ground from under
the government's case
against the Communist
Party.
In 1956, the Supreme
Court referred back to the
SACB for further evidence
a decision to require the
Communist Party to regis-
ter. But in that case, as in
many more of serious im-
portance, the court left
the constitutional issue
wide open for future deci-
sions.
The fear exists that in
a year or so the whole act
of 1950 will be thrown out
on constitutional grounds.
This would not only great-
ly hamper any of the gov-
ernment's efforts to com-
bat subversion but would
destroy the SACB itself.
In a time like this, with
the twin perils of exter-
nal attack and internal sub-
version and sabotage
looming as never before,
the court would thus
weaken the defenses of
the country more than
many advanced Sputniks.
