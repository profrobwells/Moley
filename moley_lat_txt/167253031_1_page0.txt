CURBING THE COURT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
By a decisive vote, in
which the conservative
Republican - southern
Democratic coalition pre-
vailed, the House of Rep-
resentatives recently
passed a bill limiting the
power of the Supreme
Court to strike down State
laws under what is called
the doctrine of pre-emp-
tion.
This bill, with some
changes, has been ap-
proved by the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee and
should reach the Senate
floor in the final days of
this session. Some such
legislation has been urged
ever since the Supreme
Court, in a series of deci-
sions two years ago,
reached far into the field
of legislation and serious-
ly impaired the constitu-
tional powers of the States
to protect their interests,
notably in the fields of an-
tisubversive activities.
*
The terms of the House
bill (HR 3) are simple. Its
first section provides that
"no act of Congress shall
be construed as indicating
an intent on the part of
Congress to occupy the
field in which such act op-
erates, to the exclusion of
all State laws on the same
subject matter, unless
such act contains an ex-
press provision to that ef-
fect, or unless there is a
direct and positive conflict
between such act and a
State law so that the two
cannot be reconciled or
consistently stand togeth-
er."
Then, apparently to nail
down specifically the right
of the States on the sub-
ject of sedition, a further
provision is added on that
subject.
The Senate Judiciary
Committee's bill as ap-
proved limited itself to the
latter section of the House
bill, but the chairman as-
serted that members of the
committee might offer the
more sweeping provision
of the House bill in the
shape of an amendment
on the Senate floor.
*
Since the Supreme
Court went far beyond
State laws on sedition in
its wholesale emasculation
of the powers of States, it
would seem the better part
of wisdom for the Senate
to make the terms of the
curb general. For under
the impetus of the almost
fanatical zeal of a major-
ity of this court to limit
the powers of the States
and to extend Federal
power, no one can know
where it will strike next.
To provide in every act of
Congress that Federal pre-
emption shall not apply
would seem to be a cum-
bersome way of putting
into effect a power clearly
within the jurisdiction of
Congress. The Constitu-
tion clearly gives Congress
power to define within
certain limits the jurisdic-
tion of the Supreme Court,
and it specifically pro-
vides that "the powers not
delegated to the United
States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the
States, are reserved to the
States respectively, or to
the people."
Since the amazing in-
vasion of the rights and
authority of the States
began five years ago, in-
numerable lawyers whose
capacity is just as great
as that of any of the pres-
ent members of the court,
and much, much greater
than that, of some mem-
bers, have condemned the
reckless course of de-
cisions. In the Nelson case
especially, the term "jail
delivery," was quite gen-
erally used.
A far greater jurist than
any of those now sitting,
Chief Justice Harlan F.
Stone, said of this theory
of pre-emption, now as-
serted by the court, in a
case in 1942:
*
"Due regard for the
maintenance of our dual
system of government de-
mands that the court do
not diminish State power
by extravagant inferences
regarding what Congress
might have intended if it
had considered the mat-
ter, or by reference to
their own conceptions of
a policy which Congress
has not expressed and is
not plainly to be inferred
from the legislation which
it has enacted."
It is a bit difficult for
the layman to understand
the reasoning of a court
which interpreted a Fed-
eral law on sedition as
having excluded the States
from legislating on the
subject when the original
sponsor of that Federal
legislation is still alive
and able to tell what was
in his mind and what he
knows to have been in the
minds of his colleagues
when they voted for it.
But that is the precise sit-
uation now, and fortunate-
ly that sponsor, Rep. How-
ard W. Smith of Virginia,
is mostly responsible for
the salutary curb of the
presumptuous court which
is now before the Senate,
