RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Possible Substitute
for U.S. Handouts
The ideal solution for
the problem of mounting
Federal handouts to States
is to return all the tax
sources now seized by the
Federal government from
the States, such as gaso-
line and telephone excises.
But the difficulties in
the way of that solution
are almost insuperable.
Since the ultimate objec-
tive is to preserve a meas-
urable freedom to States
and local units in deciding
what they want, unre-
stricted by bureaucratic
control from Washington,
other alternatives are be-
ing considered by friends
of economy and local in-
dependence.
The march of Federalism
goes on, apparently, un-
der all administrations.
Under President Eisen-
hower these handouts
have more than doubled
since 1953, despite his ora-
torical efforts and the
work of two commissions
on the subject. Federal
grants to States in 1956
were 25 times what they
were in 1934. When the
hysterical spending by
Congress ends this year, a
new record will be
reached.
*
The task of reversing
this trend is prodigious.
For great pressure groups
are massed in Washing-
ton, with a vast Federal
bureaucracy, greedy for
power and money, co-op-
erating with them.
For example, the AFL-
CIO's Labor's Economic
Review issued not long
ago an imposing "study,"
under a masthead embel-
lished by a list of profes-
sional economists, which
contended for three ap-
parently irreconcilable
points. First, it "proved"
that Federal grants-in-aid
do not amount to much;
second, that they are won-
derful for the people in the
States, and third, that they
induce and enable States
to expand their social serv-
ices. The statistical magic
by which the economists
"proved" these points was
more wonderful than their
appraisal of the grants
themselves.
The hard fact is that the
AFL-CIO, the National Ed-
ucation Association and
other groups find it easier
to put pressure on Con-
gress and the Federal ad-
ministration than to scat-
ter their efforts among the
States.
The regrettable fact is
that Mayors of cities and
even Governors of States
flock to Washington to
barter their freedom of ac-
tion for Federal handouts.
Another difficulty is that
when tax sources of the
kind mentioned above are
removed, the Federal gov-
ernment faces a net loss,
because the rich States pay
in more than they get in
return while the poor ones
get more than they con-
tribute. In balance, the
Federal Treasury nets a
great deal in the process.
Now, with a hard-pressed
financial situation facing
the Federal budget, such a
loss would be viewed with
alarm by Washington.
*
Since this probably
means that Congress will
not, in these immediate
years, give up any possible
source of income, it has
been suggested that an al-
ternative be tried which
would leave Federal in-
come where it is and State
receipts from the Federal
government unchanged.
This idea was advanced by
the first Hoover Commis-
sion.
It would leave the over-
all amount now given to
the States where it is, but
would make the grants
without strings. The
States would get the mon-
ey and spend it for what
they choose, without dicta-
tion from Washington as
to specific purposes and
services. If, for example,
they decided to spend Fed-
eral money for schools
rather than highways, they
could do so in any one
year.
*
This plan would remove
the great danger, involved
in the present system, of
destroying the freedom of
the States and, at the same
time, it would provide
them with the financial
help they might need. It
also would check the rise
in State expenditures, be-
cause so many of the pres-
ent plans involve match-
ing funds. In addition, it
would avoid the building
up of more bureaucratic
machinery in Washington
which is now deemed es-
sential to the supervision
of the supervision.
This is not the best so-
lution, to be sure, but it
would be improvement
and it would be less costly.
