RAYMOND MOLEY:
Conservative to Seek
Texas Senate Seat
It should be good news
for conservatives in both
parties over the country
that former Sen. William
A. Blakley of Texas has
decided to run for the
Senate. For this gives Tex-
ans a clear-cut choice be-
tween a genuine expo-
nent of conservative ideas
and, if he runs again, the
present Senator, Ralph
W. Yarborough, the dar-
ling of the radicals in that
State.
Yarborough was a peren-
nial candidate, but when
he sought the Senate seat
vacated by Gov. Price
Daniel success crowned
his effort—a success large-
ly made possible by the
political arms of the big
unions and by an organi-
zation which calls itself
"Democrats of Texas," gen-
erally referred to as DOT.
Even then, despite the
strength of this labor
union—"liberal" coalition,
Yarborough's election
would have been impos-
sible except for the ill-
advised injection of a Re-
publican candidate who
fatally divided conserva-
tive strength.

When Gov. Allan Shiv-
ers appointed Blakley to
the Senate in January,
1957, to serve until a spe-
cial election in April of
that year he was known
only among a limited num-
ber of Texans. Most said:
"Who is Bill Blakley?"
Blakley has been a
rancher, lawyer, business-
man and philanthropist re-
siding in Dallas for more
than 30 years. His exten-
sive operations have
brought him a considera-
ble fortune. Until he en-
tered the Senate he had
never made a public
speech outside a court-
room. Even in the Senate
he spoke little but won
the respect of worth-while
colleagues on both sides
of the aisle. Senate Major-
ity Leader Lyndon John-
son was enthusiastic about
Blakley's short service.
Gov. Daniel, realizing
the threat to his party that
was presented by the DOT,
has for some time been
seeking to unite the per-
sonal political strength of
Sen. Johnson, Speaker
Sam Rayburn and former
Gov. Shivers. Now he has
succeeded, because all
three are united behind
Blakley.
Since he left the Senate,
Blakley has been sprout-
ing oratorical wings by
making a number of
speeches in various parts
of the State. His develop-
ment as a speaker is re-
markable. No one is left
in doubt about where he
stands on vital public
questions and he makes
himself understandable in
the salty phraseology of
his early life in the cow
country.
★
He has hesitated a long
time about running and
two months ago his friends
were without much hope
that he would change his
mind about forsaking pub-
lic life. Apparently, what
he saw in the United
States Senate of the trend
toward the left affected
him deeply.
In his speeches since he
left the Senate a year ago
he has made clear his op-
position to Federal cen-
tralization and his belief
in "front-yard govern-
ment." Also, he strongly
supports voluntary union-
ism. As a lawyer he is
convinced that the present
Supreme Court has great-
ly exceeded its legitimate
function of law interpre-
tation and has needlessly
invaded the field of legis-
lation. Blakley's candida-
cy brings Texas into line
with Arizona and Califor-
nia in presenting candi-
dates who will stand or
fall on basic conservative
issues this fall.
★
The danger that threat-
ens Blakley is that his
natural conservative sup-
port might be divided by
the injection of a Repub-
lican candidate. At pri-
mary time Texans may
cross the party line rather
simply and, at primary
time, enough might sup-
port a Republican to tip
the balance on the Demo-
cratic side. Once the pri-
mary is past, however, the
election will be routine.
For, since Little Rock,
Texas Republicanism has
degenerated into its pre-
Eisenhower impotence.
