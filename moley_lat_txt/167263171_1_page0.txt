RAYMOND MOLEY:
Senators' Auto Tax
Proposal Assailed
Back there in those pastoral days before the word
"liberal" was stolen by
radicals, when political
and economic policies had
not been tortured to meet
new and strange notions of
public welfare—back
when Presidents like Wilson,
Taft, and Cleveland
revered and observed traditional constitutional and
economic patterns—a
number of tried and true
principles of taxation were
held to be fundamental.
Those principles, or "canons," were based upon the
proposition that the purpose of taxation was to
raise revenue.
They held that taxes
should bear as lightly as
possible on production;
that they should be easily
collected and fall as
directly as possible on the
ultimate people who pay;
and that they should not
discriminate. One might
add as a corollary that
taxes should not be used
to punish or reward any
person or group.
No doubt the Honorable Paul Douglas was familiar
with those principles, for he was a professor of
economics before
he entered politics. It is
sad to contemplate what
expediency and the fervent embracing of the politically spawned economics of the past quarter
of a century have done to
him. For he has recently
proposed a scheme which
violated not only every
decent principle of taxation but fundamental constitutional processes.
Douglas, who ought to
know better, and his colleague, Sen. Kefauver—
who neither knows better
nor cares—have introduced a bill which in effect would provide for a
deal between Congress
and the automobile companies. The excise tax on
automobiles would be refunded if the companies
would agree to pass on to
the purchasers of automobiles the amount of the refund. Sen. Kefauver then
wrote to the companies,
asking what they thought
of the proposal.
The three major companies rejected the idea,
mostly on practical
grounds. The president of
American Motors signified
his willingness to accept
the deal. It is regrettable
that none of the companies pointed out the essential vices of the proposal. Those evil characteristics are:
It would be special discriminatory legislation of
the worst sort. If wartime
excise taxes are bad and
no longer necessary they
should be repealed on
many items as well as automobiles. Such repeal
should have no strings.
The competitive system in
industry should be relied
upon to pass on to the
consumer any such relief. Moreover, it would
be a device to plunge government into price fixing,
which would itself be inimical to sound economic
conditions. It would also
do that job in an indirect,
discriminatory manner. Its
purpose would substantially be to use the taxing
power to reward or punish, rather than the basic
purpose of raising revenue under the principle
which I have specified
above.
What is most important
is the basic constitutional
evil of using legislation to
make a deal between certain private individuals
and the government. The
parties to such a flimsy
"contract are not of the
same breed. On the one
side are private corporations, bound not only by
laws but by business practices and morality. On the
other is a government.
And history has shown
abundantly that the promises of government can be
"false as dicers' oaths."
Ours is no exception, as
the repudiation of the gold
clause in the first Roosevelt term indicated. One
Congress cannot bind another, and at any time, in
fact, a Congress can violate its own promises.
Since there is no prospect that the deal can be
consummated, the danger
of such a piece of legislation is not great. But the
fact that such a thing has
been proposed shows how
far afield some "liberals"
have wandered from the
tested principles of the
past.
