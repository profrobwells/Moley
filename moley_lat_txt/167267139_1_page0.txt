RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Vice-President's
Substitution Problem
There seems to be no
difference of opinion con-
cerning the necessity that
President Eisenhower now
drastically curtail the bur-
dens of his office. This
further curtailment will
be added to the restric-
tions which his previous
heart attack have made
necessary.
This is not only a bit-
ter personal misfortune to
him and his family, but a
denial to the nation of
strong and vigorous lead-
ership at a critical mo-
ment. There will, of
course, be the usual futile
discussion of what "dis-
ability" means in the
terms of the Constitution,
and how and by whom
delegation should be made
and what its nature should
be.
*
It is easy to say that
all the worries and work
should be carried by the
Vice-President and others,
and that the partially in-
capacitated President
should make the decisions.
But to say that is to as-
sume that the making of
decisions is an armchair
matter. Decisions, if they
are to be wise, must be
made after examination of
the facts, and after discus-
sion and sometimes argu-
ment with advisers. That
means the expenditure of
energy, untrammeled by
personal concern about
what an impaired body
can safely sustain. It may
be attempted, but it must
involve uncertainties and
the shaking of public con-
fidence.
There is also the ques-
tion of the obligation of
an individual, however pa-
triotic and however dedi-
cated to the fulfillment of
a public trust, to endan-
ger his life by carrying
on. The citizen who has
understanding of the
facts, and any elements of
human compassion will
not only hope for the
President's recovery, but
will pray that he be
spared an untimely end.
We must consider how we
would feel if we were his
near kin, and sympathize
with their deep interests
in his future. He has al-
ready given a long life
to the unselfish service of
his country, for which we
all are deeply in debt to
him.

There is also the prob-
lem that must be faced by
the Vice-President, if he
is called upon to assume
what may be crushing re-
sponsibility without full
authority. To assume such
responsibility for a limit-
ed time, he should be
perfectly free to choose
his official family, to seek
advice where he believes
he can best be served,
and to speak as the
spokesman of a nation.
It will be inevitable
that those who surround
the President will consid-
er their presence indis-
pensable. But at this crit-
ical time, with a danger-
ous international situation
before us, with a financial
problem of unprecedented
proportions before the
government, with the
need for bringing about
harmony and unity
among the armed serv-
ices, with the possibility
of a business downturn
before us, and with party
problems to meet, the
Vice-President must be
free to act as his own
wisdom directs.

Perhaps resignation is
the answer. That was at
least implied in what the
President said last year.
Perhaps it means full del-
egation for a limited time.
Either of these is a toler-
able answer.
But a partial or unclear
delegation, or a divided
delegation, or a govern-
ment by committee would
be a dangerous course to
take.
If the Vice-President is
to act, he should act with
full authority as well as
full responsibility.
