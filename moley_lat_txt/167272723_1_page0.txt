ON CURBING THE COURT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Oliver Wendell Holmes
wrote, some years ago, "It
must be remembered that
legislatures are ultimate
guardians of the liberties
and welfare of the people
in quite as great a degree
as the courts." This is a
principle of our heritage.
Pending before the Sen-
ate is the Butler-Jenner
bill now under attack by
various modern "liberals."
But it or a similar bill
should be an exercise of
precisely that conception
of government which
Holmes was talking about.
It comes after a series of
recent decisions by the Su-
preme Court undermining
the legislative structure
erected by Congress and
the States for protection of
our internal security.
★
The purpose of this bill
is to limit the court in its
present propensity to ex-
ercise the legislative func-
tion and to substitute its
judgment for the judg-
ment of Congress. The
Constitution makes provi-
sion for Congress to take
such action:
"The Supreme Court
shall have appellate juris-
diction, both as to law and
fact, with such exceptions,
and under such regula-
tions as the Congress shall
make."
There is precedent, too.
Congress limited the
court's appellate jurisdic-
tion in the McCardle case
in 1869, and that case has
been upheld many times.
*
The Butler-Jenner bill
would "limit the appellate
jurisdiction of the Su-
preme Court in certain cas-
es and for other purposes."
Fundamentally, it assumes
that a "clear and present
danger" exists in interna-
tional Communism and
that, in view of recent
court decisions, a number
of measures should be
taken to strengthen public
policy against that men-
ace.
First, the bill states that
standards for bar admis-
sion may be fixed by State
courts and shall not be
subject to Supreme Court
review.
Another point is that a
Congressional committee,
not the Supreme Court,
shall be the judge as to
what questions are perti-
nent in hearings. Also, that
State courts may enforce
State statutes concerning
acts of sedition or attempts
to overthrow the govern-
ment, State or national.
Sen. Jenner
Obviously, Congressional
committees, essential arms
of the legislative power,
would be handcuffed by
the overshadowing author-
ity of the court to decide
what is pertinent to their
functions.
Perhaps most important,
the bill seeks to draw more
sharply the meaning of
terms in certain anti-Com-
munist legislation which,
it says, the court has giv-
en a construction "never
intended by Congress."
Last year the court
ruled that it is all right to
preach that the govern-
ment should be over-
thrown, so long as there is
no incitement to action. In
other words, it would be
all right to teach methods
of robbery or murder and
speak favorably of such
crimes just so long as the
teacher refrains from tell-
ing the students to go out
and commit them. The
new bill amends the U.S.
Code to make it a crime "to
teach or advocate" the
overthrow of government.
It is most important, to
note that, historically, pop-
ular legislative bodies
have been even more im-
portant in protecting indi-
vidual constitutional
rights than courts. Lord
Coke in his struggle with
the tyrannical James I
failed to vindicate person-
al and constitutional liber-
ty as a judge. James sim-
ply sacked him. But later,
as a leader in the House of
Commons, Coke secured
the passage of the Petition
of Right, as great a bas-
tion of constitutional liber-
ty as the Magna Charta.

The constitutional crisis
that has faced Congress
since the revolutionary
Supreme Court decisions
of last summer is in prin-
ciple like that against
which Franklin Roosevelt
attempted, in 1937, to pack
the court. His method
failed because it would
have destroyed the Su-
preme Court forever as a
co-ordinate branch of gov-
ernment. The present ap-
proach of the Butler-Jen-
ner bill is more rational,
more moderate and would
not impair in the slightest
degree the traditional pow-
er of the Supreme Court to
review legislation so firm-
ly established by Marshall
in the Marbury vs. Madi-
son case.
★
Therefore, it comes with
poor grace for northern
"liberals," many of whom
were solidly behind the
1937 attack, to prate now
about this "invasion" of
the court's prerogatives.
For now, as then, the Su-
preme Court has simply
invaded the legislative
sphere and annulled con-
sidered policies of Con-
gress. Under the great
mandate of the Constitu-
tion, this can be permitted
only at the cost of national
security and representa-
tive institutions.
