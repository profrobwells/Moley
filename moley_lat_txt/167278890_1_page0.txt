NO TIME FOR FACTS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the political history
of Oregon there will be
written that back in the
days when Wayne Morse
was dean of the Univer-
sity of Oregon's Law
School, he told a young
student that he would nev-
er make a good lawyer.
Whether this story be au-
thentic or not, Richard
Neuberger turned to what
Milton called the "berries
harsh and crude" of a life
of letters. His prodigious
labors drenched the ga-
zettes, local and national,
for some years. His writ-
ing was happily unham-
pered by the rigidities im-
posed by the briefs and
wills of a lawyer.

In the Senate, a wider
field opened for a man of
words. There was no edi-
torial lancet to fear, and
Uncle Sam paid the gro-
cery bills. The Senate even
opened the gates from the
field of public affairs into
the wider wastes of fiction.
There was also protection
by Article I, Section 6 of
the Constitution of the
United States which as-
sured him that he "shall
not be questioned in any
other place" for what he
says on the floor.
His gross product ex-
ceeded that of the senior
Senator, and thus he
snatched from Morse the
honor of chief pansophist
of the Senate—a term de-
fined as "a pretender to
universal knowledge." Per-
haps that is one reason
why the Morse-Neuberger
relationship has cooled.
The penalty of overin-
dulgence in words is that
it denies one the essential
time for digging up accu-
rate facts.
This deficiency was well
demonstrated by Neuber-
ger on a radio program of
April 28. In answer to
questions by panelists, he
was discussing his favorite
subject of bigger and more
expensive Federal spend-
ing on hydropower.
Since any argument
these days for Federal
spending must be but-
tressed by assertions of the
inferiority of the United
States compared with So-
viet Russia, he stated that
some 44 major projects are
building over there, four
of which are bigger than
Grand Coulee, the largest
we have to offer.

*

The discourse turned
to atomic energy applied to
the production of electrici-
ty, and the Senator glibly
asserted that while we
have been preoccupied
with atomic weapons of
war, the British and Rus-
sians have been much
more concerned with
peacetime uses of the atom
than has the United States.
Challenged by a ques-
tioner as to whether these
countries are, in fact,
ahead of us, Neuberger ad-
mitted, "I know very little
about Russia."
Nor did his acceptance of
the canard about Russia's
advantage in atomic pow-
er plants indicate that he
knows much about the
United States. According
to information which I se-
cured with great care two
months ago, plants with an
aggregate capacity of
about 650,000 kilowatts are
built in the United States
or are being built by pri-
vate companies for com-
pletion in 1960, in addition
to several government
plants already in opera-
tion. The Shippingport
plant, put on the line in
December, has 68,000 kw.
capacity. Four more are
operating—one at Valleci-
tos, Cal.; another in South-
ern California; another at
the Argonne Laboratory
near Chicago, and another
at Ft. Belvoir, Va. The
AEC has several prototype
plants in operation.
So far as Soviet Russia
is concerned, even its
eager propagandists claim
only one plant, near Mos-
cow, with a capacity of
5000 kilowatts, and an-
other building near Lenin-
grad of about the same
size.
Aside from the Senator's
underrating of his own
country's accomplish-
ments, there is another
matter of importance. For
the great Senatorial free-
dom of utterance, in the
tradition created by the
great men who have
served in the Senate, calls
for a profound sense of re-
sponsibility. Apparently
Neuberger either disdains
that tradition as a relic of
the past or he has never
heard of it.
