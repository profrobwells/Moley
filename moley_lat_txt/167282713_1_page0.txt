Unions Gird for New
Struggle in Ohio
"It's too bad Bob Taft
isn't around," the man
from Cincinnati said.
"There wouldn't be any
question about this fight
this year."
This remark was made
a few days ago when it
became certain that a con-
stitutional amendment
would be on the ballot and
would overshadow all per-
sonal candidacies in the
campaign. For the early
rumblings of the union
chiefs foreshadow the kind
of battle waged by them
against the re-election of
Taft in 1950-a battle that
they lost with such deci-
siveness that they have
been chary ever since
about their power in Ohio.
*
In that campaign eight
years ago they poured
abuse, invective, money
and manpower to repudi-
ate Taft-Hartley and the
man who had sponsored it
in the Senate. "Cost what
it may, let it be what it
will, we're going to bring
about the defeat of Sen.
Taft" was William Green's
challenge before the elec-
tion.
The language of the pro-
posed amendment is this:
"No employer or labor
organization shall deny or
abridge the right to work
by requiring membership
or nonmembership in, or
payment of money to, a
labor organization as a
condition of employment
or continued employment
in this State. All agree-
ments in conflict with this
section are, to the extent
of such conflict, unlawful
and of no effect in this
State."
Petitions with 354,210
signatures were required
to put this proposal on the
ballot, but the sponsors
came up with 465,180, an
ample margin for all con-
tingencies and also for a
preliminary demonstration
of the strength of senti-
ment in the State.
*
This proposal was at
first rather doubtfully re-
garded, not only by the na-
tional unions but by some
Republican candidates.
Ohio as a stronghold of in-
dividual choice and are
still smarting from the de-
feat of 1950 and a more re-
cent and still more deci-
sive defeat over a supple-
mentary unemployment
compensation law in 1956.
Republican candidates
who must run this year
realize that the amend-
ment will bring out a
heavy labor - Democratic
vote. Republican Gov. Wil-
liam O'Neill has not yet
made his position clear.
Sen. Bricker has advised
the choice of another year
for the test. In Washing-
ton the administration as
well as the Republican Na-
tional Committee are dead
against raising the issue
anywhere and apparently
any time. But the sponsors
are determined to have it
out.
*
Phil Hanna, Ohio AFL-
CIO executive vice-pres-
ident, has called for con-
tributions of "soul and
money." Those favoring
the amendment, he says,
will "try to brainwash the
people... they will try to
assassinate the dignity and
character of labor and try
to convince the people that
you're all hoodlums and
burglars... dig into your
treasury. Contributions to
this campaign can legally
be made by unions."
Ohio is not alone this
year in staging a campaign
on this subject. California,
Washington, Colorado,
Idaho and Kansas are also
making a decision.
It is going to be difficult
to sustain by reference to
the book of experience the
dire predictions of "slave
labor" and the "crushing
of unions" in case any of
these proposals are ap-
proved. The experience of
the 18 States which al-
ready have this sort of law
shows unions enjoying just
as great a prosperity and
growth as in the other
States. Wages are just as
good, business is just as
productive, and labor-man-
agement peace is just as
prevalent.
*
On the score of principle
there can be little legiti-
mate argument. It should
be impossible, just as it is
in fact intolerable, that an
employer and a union
leader should sit down at
a bargaining table and
foreclose the independent
choice of a worker to work
where and how his quali-
fications fit him for a job.
Of very great impor-
tance is the bearing that
the union shop has in poli-
tics. If the money contrib-
uted by workers of all and
no party affiliation can be
spent for a candidate
picked by union leaders,
the denial of justice goes
beyond economic affairs.
It is the denial to Ameri-
can citizens of their politi-
cal freedom to support
candidates of their choice.
To permit this sort of in-
justice to be prevalent will
result in a political as well
as an economic monopoly
inimical to free institu-
tions.
