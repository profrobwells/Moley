Pork-barrel legislation,
once limited to improve-
ments for rivers and har-
bors, has now taken a new
turn. Liberals in Con-
gress would provide sub-
sidized loans to all mu-
nicipalities and other
units of local government.
The so-called communi-
ty facilities bill has passed
the Senate and has been
reported out by the House
Banking and Currency
Committee. Under the
terms of this bill, either
under the version passed
by the Senate or that ap-
proved by the House com-
mittee, all sorts of com-
munity facilities and public
utilities could be built with
money provided by Feder-
al loans. The range of local
improvements which
might be financed under
the bill runs almost to the
limit of anything local au-
thorities might dream up,
from hospitals to whole-
sale farm-produce mar-
kets. Under the Senate
version it would have
sneaked in school con-
struction, a matter which
has been thoroughly de-
bated in two Congresses
and for which no real need
was reliably established.
The House, more generous
in general than the Sen-
ate, eliminated schools.
The utterly unnecessary
character of this proposal
to increase Federal defi-
cit financing by 2 billion
dollars was pointed out
by the minority in the
House committee.
To begin with, there is
no reason why municipali-
ties cannot get the money
they need from private in-
vestors. Over the past five
years more than 30 billion
dollars of new State and
municipal bonds have
been sold in the market.
In 1957 $6,900,000,000
worth were sold, which
was almost an all-time rec-
ord.
Since communities could
get the money they need
from private investment, a
substitution of Federal
money would not provide
new jobs and help termi-
nate the recession. More-
over, the recession is not
present in the industry
that would receive the
money. For the construc-
tion industry is doing well.
The Department of Com-
merce reports that be-
tween September, 1957,
and April, 1958, public-
works construction in-
creased by 1.5%. The im-
mense sale of municipal
securities in the first four
months of this year gives
the assurance that this
sector of economic life will
continue its increase in
prosperity.
The bill comes down to
an outright bribe—or, if
you would prefer a milder
term, a vote-trap—for mu-
nicipalities because it
would essentially provide
Federally subsidized fi-
nancing. The Senate bill
would permit borrowings
from the Treasury at a
rate of 3% to 3¼%. The
House committee was
more lenient. It put the
borrowing rate at 2½%.
The Federal government
is not getting its long-term
money at any such rate.
This piece of legislation
would merely add fuel to
the inevitable fires of in-
flation. For who ever
heard of a local govern-
ment that dared to refuse
something for nothing?
