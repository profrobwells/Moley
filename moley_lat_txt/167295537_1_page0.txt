RAYMOND MOLEY:
Another RFC Rises in
Small Business Unit !
The recently adjourned
Congress left an after-
math of spending schemes
to end a recession that
was ending itself. But the
melody and the cost lin-
ger on. One example is
the beefing up of the Fed-
eral government's Small
Business Administration.
The fact is that this de-
partment is growing so
rapidly and raising the
limits of its loans so high
that it threatens to be-
come another RFC. The
RFC, after long outliving
its usefulness and rapidly
becoming a scandal, was
abolished some years ago
because as a child of the
great depression it was
not justifiable in times of
piping prosperity.

But political hypocrisy
has promulgated the no-
tion that this form of re-
lief is a great boon to the
little tellow. Even the Re-
publicans are lauding pri-
vate enterprise and also
taking credit for initiating
and enlarging this form of
government interference
with the normal economic
processes. Let us see just
what it is and what it
does.
The sponsors of this
form of help create the
impression that small busi-
ness must be helped be-
cause it competes help-
lessly with big business.
But small business under
the definition imposed by
the Federal regulation
really competes with it-
self.
★
Under the definition in
use by the SBA, 67 lines
of industry in which the
standard is 1000 employ-
ees are qualified for loans.
These are lines in which
the units are characterís-
tically large, since a com-
pany with 1000 employees
is hardly a small one.
There are 280 qualified
lines in which the stand-
ard is 250 employees, but
for the most part these
are lines in which, be-
cause of the nature of the
product, even 100 employ-
ees is a large number.
If we look at the non-
manufacturing companies,
we find pretty big retail-
ers. Here the standard is
$1,000,000. Here, if you
take a business of 300
business days a year it
means receipts of $4300 a
day
not a very small
retailer! For special types
of retailing the standard
is higher. For wholesaling
the standard is $5,000,000,
which means $16,500 a day.
For truckers the standard
is $2,000,000, which is
$6600 a day. These are the
standards for financial as-
sistance.
*
Different standards are
used for government pro-
curement, where the
standard is 500 employees
for a small company.
The trend, however, is
to raise the limit of loans
to approach the RFC
stage.. Congress has just
raised the loan limit to
$350,000. Two years ago, it
was raised to $250,000
from the original $150,000.
Thus the government is
getting into big money.
Since decent prudence de-
mands collateral and a
showing of ability to re-
pay, the credit-worthiness
of a borrower increases
with size. Under such con-
ditions, the starting of a
new business is virtually
impossible.
★
The naked fact is that
competent economists say
that 98% of all firms have
less than 50 employees
and 99% have less than
500. For manufacturing,
the percentage is less
than for retailing and
wholesaling.
So far as assets are con-
cerned, in manufacturing
and mining
in which
there are more than 400,-
000 units as many as
290,000 have assets of less
than $50,000. Only 42,000
have assets of between
$50,000 and $100,000. Thus
the typical business is
very small.
Yet politics continues to
bring pressure to include
more and more companies
of medium size under the
definition of "small." Thus
the SBA works increasing-
ly to the disadvantage of
the small businesses it
was meant to help,
strengthening their com-
petitors as it grows into
a replica of the RFC.
