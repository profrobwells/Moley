THE FALL OF STASSEN
BY RAYMOND MOLEY.
The lure of the White
House has over the years
been a powerful narcotic.
Many examples might be
cited to prove that useful
careers have been blighted
by a passionate ambition
to be President.
In one case it was sug-
gested to me, in connec-
tion with a certain states-
man of a few years ago,
that the vision of the
White House was like the
incredible obsession that
drove Capt. Ahah in Mel-
ville's "Moby Dick" to dis-
aster and death in seeking
to destroy the great white
whale.
In that case an able sea
captain, to use an under-
statement, literally cast
his useful mission in life
away in pursuit of his
quarry. Statesmen who
might otherwise serve
their country usefully
twist their course in pur-
suit of an unattainable
goal.
Harold Stassen is a case
in point. There can he no
doubt about his abilities.
These were amply demon-
strated back there in Min-
nesota, when his political
fortunes were rising like a
rocket. Brilliant in his col-
lege and law school career,
he attained the Governor-
ship at the age of 31. This,
he proudly chronicles in
his "Who's Who" auto-
biography, made him the
youngest Governor in the
history of Minnesota and
the youngest Governor in
the United States.
His fame went far be-
yond his native State. Per-
haps his finest hour was
on the platform of the Re-
publican Convention in
Philadelphia in 1940,
where he stood resplend-
ent with his ample brow
crowned with the laurels
of youth, success and il-
limitable promise. His
fame sang through the na-
tion in the campaign that
followed.
He was re-elected that
year and in 1942 the in-
credible record continued.
His State re-elected him
for another term, al-
though he promised to
serve only a few months
through the legislative ses-
sion in 1943. The Repub-
lican Party in Minnesota
over the years afterward
loyally stood by him in
successive campaigns for
the Presidential nomina-
tion, even though it was
clear that he was using
his State only as a ladder
to higher things.
His campaigns for the
nomination always ended
with screaming, shouting
aggregations of youthful
citizens marching here
and there in lobbies and on
sidewalks. Youth was the
keynote, long after the
Stassen hairline betrayed
the coming of middle age.
As with so many boy prod-
igies, boyhood traits per-
sisted long after prodigious
qualities had vanished.
The pathetic lack of
clear thinking was re-
vealed repeatedly — glar-
ingly—when in the Oregon
primary campaign in 1948
Stassen was foolish enough
to match his debating
skill with the tough and
experienced Dewey. His
program in 1952 was a
mishmash of irrelevan-
cies. I was told by a Texas
millionaire that he backed
Stassen in the 1952 bid,
despite his abhorrence for
the candidate's views, be-
cause he wanted to stop
Taft, who, he believed,
could not be elected. Thus,
the Stassen campaign that
year now takes on the
shoddy texture of a stop-
somebody-else crusade.

The strange campaign to
stop Nixon in 1956 had ele-
ments of absurd comedy.
He presented as his argu-
ment the claim that Nixon
would hurt President Ei-
senhower in the election
by a specific percentage,
which was pulled out of
somewhere by a "re-
search" organization and
paid for by somewhat mys-
terious "friends," presum-
ably in New York. Accord-
ing to newspaper reports,
"unidentified sources"
bankrolled this recent hit
of comedy in Pennsylvan-
ia. Perhaps they were the
"friends" who set out to
bury Nixon in 1956.
Thus, abilities far above
the average have been frit-
tered away on a hopeless
ambition. Let us not go so
far as Cardinal Wolsey
and believe that ambition
is only a snare to cause the
fall of angels. But there
are times when ambition
slips into the wrong chan-
nel, and tragic waste is its
consequence. It can cor-
rode as well as conquer;
destroy as well as create.
