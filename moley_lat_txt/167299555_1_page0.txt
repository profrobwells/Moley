SHIPS AND
NATIONS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It has been reported by
ship operators doing busi-
ness in Russian ports that
the Soviet government is
imposing discriminatory
harbor charges on ships
registered in countries other
than the nations of
which their owners are
citizens.
This would apply to the
United States ships of the
so-called "Panlibhonco"
countries, meaning Panama,
Liberia, Honduras
and Costa Rica. The British
use the term Pan-Hon-
Lib, the meaning of which
is obvious. One term applied
to these registries is
"flags of convenience."
Another is "flags of necessity."
Vessels under such
flags are sometimes referred
to as "runaways."
No public admission of
this discriminatory action
has been made by the Soviet
government, but it
has been authoritatively
reported in Scandinavia.
The motives behind this
move are not yet apparent.

The flight of British and
American ships to foreign
registries has been going
on for some years, particularly
since the war, and
at the moment it is very
large. Owners who still fly
their own flags find this a
serious problem.
Among British owners,
the flight to foreign registries
has been caused by
excessive taxation. In this
country, construction, operating
and labor costs, as
well as taxation, are the
major reasons. Shipowners
who take this course
are at a great advantage,
since their savings in
taxes and labor costs enable
them to expand their
fleets by new buildings,
since so many of the ships
bought cheaply from the
government of the United
States at the end of
the war are getting old and
obsolete.
A spirited argument has
been under way in Britain
over this problem. Last
spring, in a letter to the
London Times, Stavros S.
Niarchos, a Greek whose
wealth and ship ownership
are fabulous, defended the
practice on several
grounds. He pointed
out that, after all, shipping
is an international concern.
He said that he could
"think of no valid reason,
certainly none which is
founded on principle, for
maintaining that a vessel
should be of any particular
nationality." Moreover, invoking
the principle of
"free enterprise," he said
there is no reason why a
shipowner should not register
his ship under the
flag of any country he
chooses.
*
These are what might be
called "good" reasons as
distinguished from "real"
reasons. The real reasons,
as Niarchos spells them
out, are that in the big
maritime nations, presumably
the United States and
Britain, taxation and inflation
combine to prevent
any shipowner or company
from accumulating
enough money to build the
great supertankers now
demanded by the oil trade.
Moreover, the pressure of
taxation on profits is such
a squeeze that banks cannot
afford to lend the
necessary money.
In a reply to Niarchos,
Robert D. Ropner, chairman
of the General Council
of British Shipping, admitted
the economic difficulty
created by taxation
and labor but denied a
Niarchos claim that, in
time of war, these vessels
would be available to the
countries in which they
are owned.
Ropner noted the difficulty
encountered by the
British, in time of their
greatest need during the
war, in securing the use
of ships flying neutral
flags. He also pointed to
considerations of patriotism
involved in any assertion
that, considering the
fact that British shipping
has always been the "lifeline"
of the nation, it does
not matter what flag a
vessel should fly.
It is a rather startling
fact, considering the long
pre-eminence of the British
merchant marine in
past years, that at the present
time more British-
owned ships are flying the
flag of the Negro Republic
of Liberia than the Union
Jack. The figures in gross
tonnage are 10,625,233 for
Liberia and 9,214,972 for
Britain.
