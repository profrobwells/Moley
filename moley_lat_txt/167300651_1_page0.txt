RAYMOND MOLEY:
Labor Measures Must
Pass Union Scrutiny
Breathes there a man
with soul so dead, with
knowledge so meager, and
wit so dim, who believes
that this Congress will
pass legislation regulating
union activities which does
not meet the approval of
the union bosses? This, in
spite of the fact that ex-
cept in the field of union
activities in politics the
major outlines of inter-
union defects have been
abundantly exposed by
the McClellan committee.
As things are shaping
up, if any legislation
should be passed—a very
doubtful possibility—it
will be fitted to the views
and other considerations
held by Sen. John Kenne-
dy. The Massachusetts
solon has taken over to his
subcommittee of the Sen-
ate Labor and Welfare
Committee the whole ques-
tion of labor legislation
and has held hearings
thereon. Apparently the
McClellan committee, of
which brother Robert
Kennedy is chief counsel,
has acquiesced in this
move. It may be that in-
dividual members of the
McClellan committee, in-
cluding the chairman him-
self, will bring in bills, but
they will have scant
chance of consideration by
this Congress.
*
Since Sen. Kennedy has
also been busy reassuring
the unions, by speeches at
their conventions and else-
where, that they have
nothing to fear but fear it-
self, the legislation which
has any chance of passing
will meet the conditions
imposed by labor leaders
in their testimony before
the Kennedy subcommit-
tee. In their statements
before that subcommittee
they have in general op-
posed any legislation ex-
cept measures to weaken
the terms of the Taft-
Hartley Act. The power-
ful president of the Broth-
erhood of Railway Clerks,
George M. Harrison, op-
poses any legislation to
regulate union "democra-
cy." Apparently he be-
lieves that plenty of dem-
ocracy exists. President
James B. Carey of the In-
ternational Electrical, Ra-
dio and Machine Workers
Union, limited his recom-
mendations to various ob-
jections to any of the
measures that are pro-
posed. In George Meany's
considerable list of sug-
gestions for a labor "re-
form program," two points
involve both labor and
management, four would
tend toward increasing la-
bor's power and three mi-
nor ones would subject un-
ions to some minor regula-
tion.
*
With a very sizable
number of Senators—reli-
ably calculated at 38—and
more than 175 House
members who are fairly
dependent upon the sup-
port of labor for re-elec-
tion, no bill could be
passed which the unions
oppose. It should be not-
ed also that other Senators
and Representatives who
are not on this list but
whose margins are small,
are now living under the
threat of opposition in
this election by AFL-CIO's
Committee on Political Ed-
ucation.
Democratic opposition
to effective labor legisla-
tion can also count on Re-
publicans such as Sen.
Ives and Javits and sever-
al others. The resound-
ing defeat of Sen. McClel-
lan's proposals showed
this alignment.
Also favoring the un-
ions' chances of escaping
any regulation by law are
the assurances and Cas-
per Milquetoast proposals
of Republican Secretary
of Labor Mitchell.
★
It might finally be said,
since Sen. McClellan
seems determined either
to bypass the very im-
portant question of union
participation in politics in
his investigation or to put
it off until the very last,
there is no chance that
there will be any strength-
ening of the Taft-Hartley
provisions which, at the
time they were passed,
seemed to outlaw union
contributions in political
campaigns.
This is the picture as
Congress turns to the final
weeks of its activities.
