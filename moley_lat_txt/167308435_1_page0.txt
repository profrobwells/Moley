The eternal frustration
of the British radical was
once expressed this way
by the Irishman, Sean
O'Faolain: "Between Eng-
land and the revolution
there will always stand
an army of bowler hats."
The great majority of
the British people, desig-
nated there as "the mid-
dle class," have controlled
Britain since the electoral
reforms of a century ago.
They have not governed it.
They have delegated that
activity to a more eminent
breed. In some years these
were the more or less edu-
cated and larger property
owners, businessmen,
traders, and the like, both
Conservative and Liberal.
They were trained at Eton,
Harrow, Oxford and Cam-
bridge.
Meanwhile, there arose
the Socialists, mainly "in-
tellectuals" with a Marx-
ist turn, and trade-union
officers. In 1945, after the
ardors of war, with no
more blood to shed but
plenty of sweat and toil
and austerity before them,
the bowler hats, good
sportsmen always, decided
to give the Socialists a
whack at it.

By 1950 they were jolly
well sick of them, for aus-
terity thrust its grimy
face through the mask. In
1951 and 1955 they went
for the Conservatives once
more. Now they have had
some unhappiness with
Conservative leadership
and in some numbers
have turned to the almost
forgotten Liberals. Recent
by-elections have seen
some Liberal victories. Old
Liberals are shouting with
enthusiasm. But this is a
bit premature.
The party polled 2,621,-
000 in 1950 but hit the
rocks of party bankruptcy
because of the number of
"deposits" on their candi-
dates that were forfeited
because of insufficient
votes. They were less am-
bitious in nominating can-
didates in 1951 and 1955
and polled only a little
more than 700,000 in each
of those years. They have
a long, long way to go in
a national voting total of
around 25,000,000.
But the bowler hats are
not turning again to So-
cialism, for reasons that
even as devoted a collec-
tivist and planner as
C. A. R. Crosland admits
in his recent book, "The
Future of Socialism." He
writes there:
"But do we now simply
go on, and in our next pe-
riod of office take over the
next five largest indus-
tries, and so on ad infini-
tum? Not many Socialists
would now definitely an-
swer yes and for the first
time for a century there
is equivocation on the left
about the future of nation-
alization.
"For this there are sev-
eral reasons. The first and
most obvious is that the
reality proved rather dif-
ferent from the blueprints.
Some of the anticipated
advantages did not materi-
alize, while certain unex-
pected disadvantages
emerged.
*
"The planning argu-
ment, for example, looks a
good deal less clear cut
than it used to. Even
where planning was ad-
mitted to be desirable, it
proved scarcely easier to
achieve under public than
private ownership."
Thus, after 496 pages of
regurgitation Crosland has
thrown up a fact that
many intelligent critics of
Socialism have been tell-
ing a long time.
Enough of quibble and
double talk and excuses. It
means simply that the
British Socialists deluded
the voters with non-
sensical ideas which had no
basis of fact or proven ex-
perience. Then when their
bluff was called in 1945
and they were given the
government and, with it,
the economy of Britain to
try out their ideas, they
clearly indicated that they
were incapable of compre-
hending what an indus-
trial civilization was all
about. The woolly minded
aggregation that had had
the public platform so long
were incompetent to run
even the simplest opera-
tions of government.
The brains under that
army of bowler hats,
which for centuries have
encompassed a rather slow
and cumbrous common
sense, tasted, saw and
heard the product of So-
cialism and gave the whole
outfit the sack.
