California Politics
Is Like No Other
Political contests in Cali-
fornia have long been
marked by interests and
angles unparalleled in any
other State. This year is
the most unusual of all.
And the political, economic
and social stakes are high-
er. It is not strange that
the eyes of the nation are
turned this way.
At the center of interest
are the contest for the Gov-
ernorship between Sen.
William Knowland and
Atty. Gen. Edmund G.
Brown and the effort to
put into the State Consti-
tution a prohibition
against compulsory union
membership as a condition
of employment under a la-
bor-management contract.
The Knowland-Brown
and right-to-work issues
are closely related because
the candidates are on op-
posite sides on the right-
to-work issue. However,
the backers of the amend-
ment are conducting their
own campaign and the Re-
publican organization and
its contributors are for
Knowland. While most
people, including substan-
tial contributors, are for
Knowland and right-to-
work, there are some who
put the two on a priority
basis. On the one hand are
people who regard the
possession of the Gover-
norship as secondary to
the establishment of the
principle of voluntary
unionism. Others say that
it will be of little avail to
have the principle in the
Constitution if the Gover-
nor and the Legislature
are hostile to any imple-
mentation of it by statute
and enforcement.
A most serious complica-
tion and handicap for
Knowland and right-to-
work is the hostility to
both of Gov. Goodwin
Knight. Knight's opposi-
tion is well known and
long established. He is
embittered by his shift to
the Senatorial candidacy
because of the entry of
Knowland—a shift, how-
ever, in which Knowland
had no part. Efforts to cre-
ate harmony between
Knight and Knowland, in
which Vice-President Nix-
on's speeches have strong-
ly urged the interest of
party success, have failed.
So there are Knight Re-
publicans and Knowland
Republicans. And since
party loyalties mean little
here, there are Knight
Democrats and Knowland
Democrats.
The odds against which
Knowland has contended
since the primary in June
have created an element
of defeatism among con-
tributors and potential
workers. Knowland and
other Republican candi-
dates have been crippled
by inadequate funds. On
the other hand, powerful
unions have poured money
into the Brown and anti-
right-to-work causes. Bas-
ically, the struggle, which
mounts in intensity daily,
is between the powerful,
local and international un-
ions with a Democratic
Party reorganized and
beefed up and probably
controlled by the unions,
on one hand, and a consid-
erable part of business
management, with what
there is of a not-too-strong
Republican Party, on the
other. Up to now, the for-
mer is better organized,
financed and managed.
A comparison of the
situation here with the
Taft campaign for the
Senate in Ohio in 1950
strikes me vividly. When
I was in Ohio in Septem-
ber of that year, there was
deep pessimism in the
Taft camp. Union leaders
openly and most opulent-
ly were backing Taft’s op-
ponent, who had some re-
semblance to Brown here.
But Ohio citizens, with ac-
tive leadership of public-
spirited management in
all grades of business, and
a fairly good Republican
organization together with
Taft’s incredible cam-
paigning, turned the tide
and forged ahead in the
last two weeks.
With the same awaken-
ing in California, the tide
might well be turned here.
For there are time and
plenty of potential fluidity
in California opinion. Time
—a short time of two or
three weeks—will tell.
The values are high. In
the cases of Taft and
Knowland, the public ca-
reers of big men—states-
men proved in the Senate
—were and are at stake.
The economic growth of
the immense State of Cali-
fornia is gravely threat-
ened by the radical plat-
form on which Brown is
running and by the ele-
ments supporting him. An-
other—No. 17—is so out-
rageous in its threat to the
solvency of the State that
even some Democratic
candidates have come out
against it. Another pro-
posed amendment—No.
16—threatens private
schools by a denial of tax
exemption. Religious bod-
ies affected by this are
furiously militant. Also
involved are the prospects
of California in influenc-
ing the Republican Presi-
dential nomination in
1960. Here the concern of
the Vice-President must
be considerable. It is a
campaign almost unique
in variety, interest and
complexity.
