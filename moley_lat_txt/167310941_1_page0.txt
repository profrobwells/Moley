Ten years ago this
month, amid great expec-
tations and crazy financial
estimates, the Attlee La-
bor government of Britain
launched its so-called Na-
tional Health Service.
Aneurin Bevan, radical
Socialist, if not its father
was its nurse and guard-
ian in its early years as
Minister of Health. (On
one occasion in the House
of Commons Bevan ac-
cused Winston Churchill,
then leader of the opposi-
tion, of calling him "Min-
ister of Ill-health." Church-
ill replied that the right
honorable gentleman was
incorrect: "I called him
Minister of Defense.")

Under this flowering of
the welfare state, every-
thing at first was free—
medical and dental care,
drugs, hospitalization,
false teeth and false hair,
spectacles, braces, invalid
chairs and other items.
Later, as costs became
prohibitive, a small charge
was made for spectacles
and drugs, although Labor-
ites shouted angry dissent.
A sort of compulsory in-
surance was supposed to
cover a considerable part
of the cost, with what re-
sults I shall presently
show. The major expense
fell upon the generality of
taxpayers.
Confronted with compe-
tition with Dr. Santa
Claus, private practition-
ers succumbed and en-
tered the service. Their of-
fices were jammed with
patients, and hospitals
were crowded with the
real and imaginary ill.
Pharmacists did well
with "sales" of real and
palliative drugs and nos-
trums. The average doc-
tor, confronted with a cli-
entele running into the
hundreds, dismissed them
with prescriptions or
passed them on to hos-
pitals.
*
With steadily mounting
costs, it was impossible for
the government to rebuild
or replace antiquated hos-
pitals. Only one new
Health Service hospital
has been completed since
the war.
The Laborites' estimate
of costs proved utterly
wrong in the very first
year, when the final budg-
et reckoning indicated ex-
penses of $1,200,000,000.
From then on costs have
mounted until the present
fiscal year the bill will be
more than 2 billion dol-
lars.
This is certainly not due
to any rise in population,
for the cost per capita has
grown 46%. Nor can it be
attributed, except in part,
to inflation.
*
Since government has
assumed the entire respon-
sibility for medical and
dental care, there has been
a slowing down of volun-
tary and co-operative
plans. And private philan-
thropy, staggering under
heavy income and death
taxes, has been of slight
help.
As for covering this im-
mense cost with "insur-
ance"—a fraudulent claim
made in the United States
in behalf of the various
schemes for government
medicine—only about 15%
of the cost of the Health
Service has been covered
by "national insurance
contributions." The big
burden is on the general
taxpayer.
Two important conclu-
sions arise from a con-
sideration of this experi-
ment in Socialism. The
first is that the human
weakness known as hypo-
chondria not only is very
prevalent but its growth
can be prodigious when
there is no economic de-
terrent in the way of
pestering a doctor with
imaginary ailments. Yet
the government pays for
these "malades imagi-
naires" just the same as
for the really sick, and
they can be treated more
easily.
Another conclusion is
that under this universal
free service the needy,
physically and financially,
have not done so well as
under the systems of aid
that prevailed before 1948.
*
Under the old arrange-
ments the aged, the chron-
ic and the indigent were
treated to medical care
and hospitalization with-
out charge by various lo-
cal authorities. But under
the philosophy of welfar-
ism a "needs" test is de-
grading. Hence, under the
system no "need" might
be investigated. And the
effect of spreading the lim-
ited means of a postwar
Britain over the entire
population meant that the
needy got less than before.
One tragic result has
been the effect upon the
system under which chil-
dren got dental attention
while in school. This, as
anyone who has traveled
in England will know, is
a dire necessity. But im-
mediately after the new
regime took over, dentists
left the relatively unremu-
nerative school service to
care for the general pub-
lic. Hence, the school
dental service almost en-
tirely collapsed.
This experience of
Britain under Socialism
proves a fundamental that
the "brave new world"
cannot, or will not face.
There is enough for every
need but heaven alone can
meet every want.
