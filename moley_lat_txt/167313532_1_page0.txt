There seems to be some
eyebrow-raising about the
fact that many Republi-
can candidates in the
North and Democrats in
the South have made an
issue of the AFL-CIO's
Committee on Political
Education or, if you will,
of Reutherism in this cam-
paign.
Mostly, however, the
critics are either favor-
able to the aims and poli-
cies of COPE or are inno-
cents who never ran for
public office or never have
had an important part in
the realities of politics.
The legitimacy of this
as an issue depends upon
three circumstances:
Is it true that the po-
litical arms of the AFL-
CIO do actively and ex-
clusively support the
Democratic Party in sec-
tions of the North and the
leftist faction of the
Democratic Party in the
South?
If so, is this influence
important, even dominant,
in the party or faction?
Finally, there is the
practical matter of public
interest. Is it a good thing
in a political campaign to
hit hard at the differences
between candidates?
The answer to all three
of those questions should
be "yes."
Speaking now of the Re-
publican Party in the
North and West, it is true
that the AFL-CIO COPE
limits its opposition almost
exclusively to Republi-
cans. In a few cases Re-
publican Senators or Con-
gressmen receive its en-
dorsement. But in such
isolated cases the record of
these members shows a
strict obedience to the
measures proposed or sup-
ported by the AFL-CIO.
It is also true that
spokesmen for the AFL-
CIO deny their own in-
fluence. But that is what
they say publicly. Private-
ly they are arrogant and
boastful. In 1952 it was
that stalwart Democrat
Alben Barkley who tear-
fully said at the Demo-
cratic convention that a
little group of union lead-
ers, 16 in number, vetoed
his Presidential aspira-
tions.
James F. Byrnes in
his remarkable autobiogra-
phy, "All in Our Lifetime,"
now lays bare the fact that
Roosevelt's directive:
"Clear it with Sidney
(Hillman)," denied him the
Vice-Presidency and, as
providence decreed, the
Presidency in 1944.
It is also true that the
sworn accounting of one
union in one State in 1954
indicates that it spent close
to $3,000,000 on the "po-
litical education" that
elected a Senator and a
number of Congressmen.
See also the figures in the
report of the Senate Sub-
committee on Privileges
and Elections on the 1956
campaign-a report domi-
nated by Democratic
members.
A specific example
comes to light at the mo-
ment from the 10th Con-
gressional District of Vir-
ginia, which includes Ar-
lington and Fairfax Coun-
ties. The Republican Con-
gressman from that dis-
trict is Joel T. Broyhill.
There, according to unim-
peachable testimony by
members of the Fairfax
Board of Supervisors, rep-
resentatives of COPE de-
manded services of the
board which were not al-
lowed by its stated poli-
cies, not available to other
citizens, and would have
been a gross use of public
services for one candi-
date.
This demand was re-
fused, and Mr. Broyhill
made the facts public.
Some of those who decry
the influence of COPE in
the States and districts
should endure what Re-
publican candidates must
meet from the Democratic
Party's powerful auxili-
ary.
In one State employees
of a union group disguised
themselves and went from
house to house spreading
untrue and damaging
stories about a candidate
they opposed.
In California, where I
spent several days earlier
this month, it is true that
as long as a year ago
there were many union
political workers already
at work to prepare for the
election this year.
