When I returned to
New York after several
days in California, it was
apparent that some of the
infection that has affected
the Republican Party
there is already at work
in the Empire State.
With the powerful aid of
a most expensive buildup,
paid out of tax-exempt
foundation money, and a
Park and Madison Avenue
advertising drive of mam-
moth proportions, Nelson
Rockefeller was railroaded
to the nomination for Gov-
ernor over the recumbent
bodies of two real Repub-
licans who deserved much
from their party.
Republican district lead-
ers, hungry for something
to fill their depleted treas-
uries and patronage piles,
flocked to this emblem of
affluence. Harlem Repub-
lican leaders had visions
of beguiling constituents
by parading a candidate
who would be advertised
as the man who cured
hookworm back in 1909
(when Nelson was in the
cradle). There was also
Rockefeller Center, shin-
ing monument of univer-
sal benevolence and ex-
pensive office space.
The Rockefeller cam-
paign advertising has plas-
tered the State. I have
carefully scrutinized the
posters, billboards and bus
ads and have failed to find
the word "Republican"
mentioned. A few include
the name of Keating, Re-
publican candidate for U.S.
Senator. But no mention
is made of the other peo-
ple on the ticket nomi-
nated with Rockefeller at
the Republican convention
in August.
Such inspired cliches
abound as "put go in gov-
ernment," and typograph-
ical arrangements of "vim,
victory, vision, vigor," etc.
What we are witnessing is
a well-developed Park-
Madison blitz similar to
those which assured de-
feat for Willkie in 1940
and won an empty (for
the party) victory for Gen.
Eisenhower in 1952 over
Taft.
It is assumed by the
Rockefeller supporters
that if California is lost to
the Republican Party with
consequent embarrass-
ment to Vice-President
Nixon, and Rockefeller
wins in New York, the
way will be cleared for
another stampede over the
decayed remains of tradi-
tional Republicans in 1960.
Democrats in New York
also have miseries. But, as
compared with the insidi-
ous malignancy that
threatens the Republican
Party nationally, theirs is
a mere case of strawberry
hives. Harriman is not a
popular Governor, but
there is nothing special
against him except the
condition of New York's
finances. That matters lit-
tle to voters this year. His
mien and speeches make
one think of a mortician
lecturing on rigor mortis.
But he has an organiza-
tion behind him.
Republicans who know
their business realize what
is happening. They view
the possibility of a victory
for their candidate for
Governor with the same
foreboding with which
Pyrrhus looked to the fu-
ture after slaughtering the
Romans at Heraclea (inci-
dentally, with the aid of
elephants): "Another such
victory and I shall be
ruined."
Rockefeller's promises
rival the abundance of his
grandpa's beneficences.
Free medical and hospital
treatment for all. More
highways. Boss, disease
and crime eradication.
Subsidized housing for
lower, middle and other
kinds of people. His be-
lief in housing is proved
by the advertising of his
own five or six or more
mansions. Unfortunately,
Harriman has given away
the castle his father built.
Reporters marvel that
men reared on bread and
milk—in the family tradi-
tion—can down pizzas,
gefuellte fish, bagels and
borscht with so much rel-
ish. While Rockefeller
rustles up votes in the cor-
ner delicatessen, Harri-
man, arriving breathless
and demanding more of
the same, narrowly es-
capes riot in a supermar-
ket.
There is a certain Philis-
tinism in the reports of
how Rockefeller, the child
of fortune, should move
about a common restau-
rant and grasp the floury
hand of the cook. Of
course, every political
ham, from Glen Taylor to
Pappy O'Daniel, has done
that for ages. Rich men
like Harriman and Rocke-
feller don't campaign very
well, but, as Samuel John-
son reminded us, a dog
doesn't walk well on his
hind legs. The marvel is
that he can do it at all.
