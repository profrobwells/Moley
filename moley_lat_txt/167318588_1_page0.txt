RAYMOND MOLEY:
Voluntary Unionism
and the Ministry
Some weeks ago, I
wrote in Newsweek maga-
zine an article in which I
regretted the entry of
clergymen of a number of
denominations into the
political campaign for and
against legally sanctioned
voluntary unionism. I
shall in what follows sum-
marize my reasons for
holding this opinion.
Since clergymen are ar-
ticulate people, I have had
a number of letters from
that profession, disagree-
ing with me. Running
through those letters is
the refrain that since the
question involves a moral
issue, they have a right
and duty to participate.
*
It seems to me, now on
the eve of the election in
a number of States in
which this issue is to come
before the electorate, that
I have also a right and
duty to offer the views of
a professional commenta-
tor on political affairs.
In the first place, when
an argument is made sole-
ly on moral right, the im-
plication is that the other
side has no moral ground.
It becomes an issue of
right versus wrong, black
and white. "Are you
against sin or for sin?"
That sort of debate stirs
emotions and prejudices
that should have no part
in a political debate.
The fact is that there
are moral values on both
sides of this question. On
the one side is the right,
in a free economy, for em-
ployers and their workers
to make contracts free
from unreasonable legal
restrictions. On the other
is the right of a man to
work at his trade without
the compulsion of joining
a union.
★
When there are two
rights in conflict, material
elements must be consid-
ered which are not within
the realm of morals.
Granting that unions are
desirable in economic life,
must they be maintained
by compulsion, in which a
minority of the workers
involved have no choice?
Have laws outlawing com-
pulsory union membership
actually injured the union
movement? As a practical
matter, is it not better
that union leadership be
kept on its toes making
membership attractive,
and desirable, rather than
to give that leadership a
monopoly power in the
business or trade in-
volved? Such activity to
hold membership volun-
tarily is a needful tonic
for any organization — be
it a trade union, a trade
association of businesses,
or a church.
So far as the "free rider"
argument is concerned—
that is, the quite reason-
able contention that a
worker who gets the bene-
fit of collective bargaining
should give to support the
collective effort—there is
a clear answer. I would
be willing, as an employer,
to require as a condition of
employment that a worker
contribute an amount to a
union, with or without
membership, which covers
the legislative cost of the
service of collective bar-
gaining.
★
That plan was, in fact,
offered a year or more ago
by the Santa Fe Railway
to a number of unions,
members of which were
working for it. But it
made clear that those dues
were not to be used for
political activity which
was entirely outside the
business of collective bar-
gaining. The union lead-
ers rejected the offer, thus
making clear that they
wanted enforced contribu-
tions from all members,
who might be of both po-
litical parties, to a single
party or candidates select-
ed by those leaders. In
fact, in a case decided by
the Supreme Court in con-
nection with a right-to-
work law in one State, the
court made a clear distinc-
tion between money used
for the normal purposes of
a union and the political
activities which are so
characteristic of many of
them.
This is a point that is
missed in much of the ar-
gument over voluntary un-
ionism and a very vital
one. For the political as
well as the economic rights
of a worker are violated
when he is forced to give
money to a political pur-
pose to which he is op-
posed.
I would like to have my
friends in the clergy who
believe they have all right
on their side to consider
this point.
