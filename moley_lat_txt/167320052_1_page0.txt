RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Cautious Prophecy
of November Drear
This commentator has
always been hesitant about
predicting the results of
elections.
There are a number of
good reasons for this. In
the first place, he con-
ceives of his job as saying
what he thinks should hap-
pen rather than what will
happen. Also, since he is
privileged to sign his ma-
terial as opinion, he realiz-
es how much he wants
things to happen and,
therefore, that his judg-
ment may be mingled with
wishful thinking.
There is also the very
practical fact that proph-
ecy involves so many in-
calculable and unknow-
able factors that it is ex-
ceedingly dangerous and
likely to be misleading. I
want neither to mislead
nor to discredit myself.
The crystal ball is a time
bomb.
But here and now, with
the proviso that before
election the outlook might
change, and after talking
with a good many compe-
tent observers, I find that it
is a safe chance that the
Republican Party stands
to lose about six Senate
and 30 House seats in the
forthcoming election. That
is a defeat of very consid-
erable proportions.
★
As these observers see
it, as far as the Senate con-
tests are concerned, Maine
is lost, and Michigan;
Knight in California looks
bad (I believe he will run
behind Knowland); New
Jersey likewise seems pre-
carious; Hogan with a big
New York City vote stands
to win. West Virginia,
electing two Senators, will
split, and Alaska will split.
The chances are even in
Connecticut and Wyo-
ming.
There will be hard fight-
ing in Utah, Arizona and
Pennsylvania, but the Re-
publican candidates have
the edge. No one seems to
have a guess about Ne-
vada. There is a good
chance of the Republican
beating Proxmire in Wis-
consin. Bricker and Hand-
ley seem safe in Ohio and
Indiana.
A fair evaluation of
these possibilities would
mean about six net Senate
losses.
So far as the House is
concerned, the estimate of
losses I mention above
takes account of the great
number of retirements of
conservative Republican
members, and other factors
of a more general char-
acter.
I cannot believe that
the general economic sit-
uation is the predominant
reason for Republican dis-
tress. The effect of the re-
cession was not general
nor was it especially hard
on workers except in se-
lected industries. Savings
and the standard of living
were not greatly impaired.
It certainly was not, de-
spite the exploitation of
the issue by politicians,
something to cause a na-
tional voting trend.
★
Much of the trouble for
the Republican Party
came from within itself.
Modern Republicanism, ex-
ploited by a few amateurs
around an amateur Presi-
dent, hurt very consider-
ably. It chilled the enthusi-
asm of thousands of Re-
publican regulars over the
country and turned candi-
dates away from depend-
ence upon the President's
prestige and record to a
personal fight for survival
at the polls.
The Adams mess was, to
say the least, highly em-
barrassing to a party elect-
ed to elevate standards of
public conduct.
Generally, it can be re-
corded with some sadness
by Republicans that while
the Republican Party
could survive many de-
feats at the polls, it has
suffered more by two
Presidential victories.
Unity and revival will
have to wait until the elec-
tion this year is over and
faces are turned to 1960.
In that revival the role of
Vice-President Nixon
must be the most impor-
tant element. For he knows
the facts of political life
and can be articulate in
spelling out a party phi-
losophy in the months and
years after the defeat.
