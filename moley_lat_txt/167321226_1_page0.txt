Foreign policy is made
by situations, not cogita-
tions. This is a fact appar-
ently misunderstood by
those who complain about
the Dulles and Eisenhower
policies in the past few
years. Strategy wins or
loses a war or a national
objective, even a cold war.
Tactics involves the con-
duct of a battle.
The strategy carried
over from the Truman ad-
ministration has been firm
resistance to Communist
aggression, either by mili-
tary means or subversion.
That is what is behind the
move into Lebanon. The
decisions to make exactly
that move at this time may
in the end prove to be too
early or too late. But as
the facts now known
should make obvious, the
choice was either the
show of force or the aban-
donment of objectives de-
termined long in advance
by the President and ap-
proved by Congress. Such
an abandonment would
have opened the gates to
Communism all over the
world.

It is my firm convic-
tion that our position was
wrong when the British
and French moved to stop
Nasser in the Suez crisis
21 months ago. A great
many who approved the
President's action then--
and I confess that this
writer was among those
people must now see
that Britain and France
would have stopped Nas-
ser in his tracks, and per-
haps would even have un-
horsed him completely.
The British Conservatives
who projected that inter-
vention were wiser than
the second-guessers in the
Labor Party and a majori-
ty of Americans.
Nasser has now proved
to be not only a pawn of
the Kremlin but a person
capable of subverting a
considerable portion of
the world. But that mis-
take of ours is now water
through the canal. There
is time, it can be validly
believed, to stop the ma-
lignant expansion of his
power. If a general war
ensues, we can accept it
as having been inevitable
later, when the Soviets
might have more of an ad-
vantage, if it be advan-
tage, than they have now.
It is easy to point to pos-
sible dire consequences.
But two can play at the
game of pointing-with-
alarm.
This is not said because
in a situation like this we
should stand with the
President, right or wrong.
It is because the facts
known to all who can read
or see justify the Presi-
dent's action.
It is easy for Sen. Ful-
bright to say as he has
that "people everywhere
who aspire to the good life
are unable to identify their
desires with our policies"
and that we have "lost
touch with ordinary peo-
ple." The people who trig-
gered the Iraq revolution
were not "ordinary peo-
ple." They were people
who, like the masters of
the Soviets over the last
40 years, were accustomed
to achieving their ends, as
Ambassador Lodge re-
minded the United Na-
tions, by "assassination,
violence, mob rule or sub-
version." And what they
put in the place of the gov-
ernment there was not a
republic, was not self-de-
termination, and was not
democracy.
Fulbright is echoing the
appeal of Woodrow Wil-
son for democracy, self-
determination, and the ove-
erthrow of kings and the
creation of peoples' repub-
lics. But Fulbright cannot
be absolved, as was Wil-
son, because he was un-
aware of who might use
those sweet words to
achieve vile and reprehen-
sible ends. Forty years of
experience have added to
our knowledge of the
forces abroad in the world
since Wilson. Apparently
Sen. Fulbright has not tak-
en advantage of that post-
graduate course in experi-
ence.

Herbert Hoover was far
better acquainted with the
distortions common to Eu-
ropean and Asiatic state-
craft back there in 1918-
1919 than was Wilson. And
he has profited by what
has happened since. In
his notable Independence
Day address in Brussels he
suggested that instead of
using the word "democra-
cy"—strayed, lost and
stolen by wicked men—we
stand for representative
government firmly estab-
lished on the basis of pow-
er delegated by free peo-
ple. I might add that when
governments are estab-
lished by any other means,
they are inimical to the
interests of free men ev-
erywhere, including Amer-
icans.
