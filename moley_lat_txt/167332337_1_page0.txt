HOOVER SPEAKS
FOR AMERICA
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No one in the United States could be so well suited
to present the views and represent the ideals of our
pepole to the many nations of Europe as Herbert
Hoover.
It was well that President Eisenhower chose him to
speak for us on Independence Day at the Brussels Ex-
position. The choice was far better than to select any
member of an administration which is so deeply in-
volved as is this one in the immediate political and
military affairs of Eu-
rope.
Mr. Hoover,. perhaps
next to President Eisen-
hower, is the one Ameri-
can Europe knows best.
And certainly no American
is so respected and loved
by those abroad who are
old enough to know of his
humanitarian activities in
their behalf in World War
I and since.
His speech, he says, was
more difficult to write
than anything he has
ever attempted. For Eu-
rope has had enough of
American boasting about
our material progress and,
to a degree, enough of re-
minders concerning what
we did for nations there
in two great wars. Our
money, we have learned-
or some of us have learned
-will not buy their re-
spect and friendship. Nor
will our advice as to what
they should do about their
governments be well re-
ceived.
*
Hence, Hoover scrupu-
lously avoided such annoy-
ing diversions. Instead,
his address was a reasoned
and moving exposition of
our ideals and political
methods. He said:
"At this point I may in-
ject another interpretation
of the American people.
We have no desire to im-
pose our formula of life or
method of government up-
on other nations. We make
no claim that our system
or our people are perfect.
As human beings are not
usually perfect, we share
the domestic imperfections
of all free peoples.
"And my countrymen
are in constant motion to
'eradicate our failings-
and when I am home I
have often joined them.
But the purpose of this ad-
dress is not our domestic
troubles but the better un-
derstanding of our ideals
and aspirations which
radiate to other nations."
*
Among many who heard
this venerable man speak-
ing for America, the oc-
casion must have evoked
the well-used expression
of Emerson to the effect
that what we are speaks
with more eloquence than
anything we say. Here
was a statesman nearing
his 84th birthday who for
44 years has served the
public interest in his own
country and over the
world.
Some knew that the as-
sumption of this great re-
sponsibility was no small
personal effort. For less
than two months ago Mr.
Hoover left a New York
hospital after a major op-
eration, cheerful and full
of vigor. In accepting the
offer he limited his stay in
Europe to less than three
days. He took passage on
the President's, aircraft
and flew over the day be-
fore the address, and re-
mained in Brussels an ad-
ditional day to be present
at what the exposition au-
thorities designated as
Hoover Day and to make
another laboriously pre-
pared speech.
*
This would be no easy
schedule for a youngster.
For a man with the handi-
cap of Hoover's years and
recent hospitalization it
is nothing short of amaz-
ing.
He has nothing to gain
from such an endeavor
but the satisfaction of
serving his country with
all that he has. This is the
Hoover who has survived
the bitterness of defeat
and the often undeserved
blows of political enemies.
He lives on to serve as an
interpreter of what he
called in his speech "the
spirit of compassion that
spreads from every Amer-
ican home to all man-
kind."
