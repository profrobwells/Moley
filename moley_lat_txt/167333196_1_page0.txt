RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Supreme Court
and Congress' Rights
Of all the controversial
decisions of the Supreme
Court a year ago the one
most generally condemned
in Congress and elsewhere
involved the Watkins case.
In that case the court
presumed to arrogate to
itself the pertinency of
questions asked of a wit-
ness by a committee of
Congress. This, is was
claimed, was a flagrant in-
vasion of the proper prov-
ince of the co-ordinate
legislative branch of the
government. Critics of the
court asserted that only
the committee itself, when
acting within the area
of investigation conferred
upon it by the House or
Senate, could decide what
facts were relevant to its
inquiry and the questions
essential to the findings of
those facts.
*
This year the Supreme
Court has returned to the
fray, heedless of the
criticisms in Congress con-
cerning the Watkins deci-
sion.
Harry Sacher was con-
victed of contempt of Con-
gress for refusing to tell
the Senate Permanent In-
vestigations Subcommit-
tee whether he was or
ever had been a member
of the Communist Party.
He claimed that the ques-
tion was not pertinent to
the committee's business.
Now the Supreme Court
has agreed with him, cit-
ing the Watkins case as
precedent.
The Butler-Jenner bill,
which has the approval of
the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, would remove
from the appellate power
of the Supreme Court the
determination which it
made in both the Watkins
and Sacher cases.
★
There is no question
about the constitutional
authority of Congress to
limit and define the appel-
late jurisdiction of the Su-
preme Court. In Article
III, Section 2. it is stated
that the appellate jurisdic-
tion of the Supreme Court
(excluding certain cases
in which its original juris-
diction is specified) shall
be subject to "such excep-
tions and such regulations
as the Congress shall
make."
Since some people, in-
cluding a number of law-
yers, have criticized the
Butler-Jenner bill as an
invasion by Congress of
the domain of the Su-
preme Court, a word of
explanation is essential.
The pertinent section of
the Butler - Jenner bill is
this:
"Provided . any ques-
tion (asked by the com-
mittee) shall be pertinent
unless timely objection is
made thereto that the...
question lacks pertinency,
or when such objection is
made, if the question is
ruled pertinent by the
body conducting the hear-
ing..."
The committee report
on the Butler-Jenner bill
explains this provision in
detail. It says that the
"body" mentioned is a
Congressional committee
or subcommittee. The
"pertinency" to which ref-
erence is made means that
the question shall be di-
rectly within the jurisdic-
tion conferred upon the
committee or subcommit-
tee by the House or the
Senate, whichever may be-
involved.
★
Such a dispute between
the witness and the com-
mittee or subcommittee
when a judgment of con-
tempt is sought is always
resolved by the vote of the
House or Senate. Thus, be-
fore the matter can reach
the courts at all, the House
or Senate must have ini-
tiated a contempt prose-
cution. Therefore, the
question of the legitimacy
of the question has been
reviewed by the appropri-
ate house of Congress,
which has in fact affirmed
that the question is with-
in the jurisdiction of the
committee or subcommit-
tee.
The bill therefore does
not permit a committee or
subcommittee to ask ques-
tions outside its legiti-
mately conferred field of
inquiry. The matter is sub-
ject to the review of the
house which created the
committee or subcommit-
tee.
★
Thus the Supreme Court
in both the Watkins and
Sacher cases not only has
attempted to dictate to an
investigating committee or
subcommittee but has also
reached into the clear do-
main of the Congress itself
and has told it what it can
investigate and how. If
ever there was an inva-
sion of the prerogatives of
one branch of our govern-
ment, this is it. The But-
ler-Jenner bill is a plain,
constitutional measure to
reassert the rights of Con-
gress.
