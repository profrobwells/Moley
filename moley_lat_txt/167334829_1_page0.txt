RAYMOND MOLEY:
Playing Politics With
Social Security
Occasionally it is well to
note the soft terms in
which social insurance was
sold to the American peo-
ple and Congress. In 1934
President Roosevelt said
that he was devising a
plan to provide security
against the "hazards and
vicissitudes of life."
The system, bad as it
has been from the begin-
ning, has done just that
for thousands of needy
people. But in its continu-
ing extension, which poli-
ticians call its "broaden-
ing," it has gone far be-
yond its original intent
and has become a bonanza
for fending off from mem-
bers of Congress the "haz-
ards and vicissitudes of
politics."
★
In the present Congress
there are no less than 400
bills to extend the system
in one way or another.
Practically all of these in-
volve more money. All
would go beyond helping
the needy.
Meanwhile, the system
itself is on a financial and
actuarial basis which
promises vast deficits and
the dilution of the savings
of those who have saved
for their own security.
It is true that the Presi-
dent and Secretary Folsom
attempted to fight off the
more extreme proposals.
But in the hearings on the
subject Folsom pointed
out that while the Old Age
and Survivors Insurance
Fund is shrinking by the
day and month it will be
safe for some years to
come.
★
But this "fund" is not a
fund in the accepted sense
of the word. It is not mon-
ey in the bank. It consists
of government IOUs which
must be refunded out of
tax money as it is used.
Moreover, the companion
operation in the system,
the Old Age Assistance
program, lives on, appar-
ently in perpetuity, de-
spite the fact that when
it was set up it was re-
garded as a temporary
method of giving relief un-
til the OASI beneficiaries
would have made the es-
sential contributions to en-
able them to secure bene-
fits.
But the Folsom opti-
mism concerning the
soundness of the OASI
fund is hardly justified by
the facts. The system is
even at the moment run-
ning in the red. It is pay-
ing out more than it is
taking in at a truly alarm-
ing rate. This is not some-
thing that has happened
this year. It was true even
in the piping days of 1955.
In that year William R.
Williamson, who was chief
actuarial consultant when
the system was born in
1933, said that the OASI
was "bankrupt financially
and ethically."
Commenting on those
remarks, Mr. Williamson
explains that "OASI's un-
funded accrued liability
in 1955, using pension
fund methods, was ad-
mitted to be some 300 bil-
lion dollars against a trust
fund of about 23 billion
dollars. Approximately
90% of the OASI tax col-
lections in 1955 were ex-
pended in benefits and ad-
ministrative costs."
★
Mr. Williamson predicts
that "for the calendar year
1958 the outlay for Old
Age and Survivors Insur-
ance (excluding perma-
nent and total disability
insurance, which has its
own separate fund) will
run about 1 billion dollars
in excess of OASI taxes
and interest on the OASI
trust fund."
Secretary Folsom sub-
stantially admitted this
fact this year: "With bene-
fits increasing more than
had been expected, the
trust fund is expected to
decline from about 23 bil-
lion dollars at the begin-
ning of the current fiscal
year to about $22,500,000,-
000 by the end of this
month. This, will be the
first fiscal year in which
the fund has declined
since it was established in
1940. A further decline of
about $1,100,000,000 is ex-
pected in the 1959 fiscal
year. By the end of fiscal
1962 the trust fund is ex-
pected to be within a
range of from $19,200,000,-
000 to $21,500,000,000."
These grave facts, how-
ever, mean nothing to
those who are clamoring
for the passage of bills in
Congress to put even more
impetus in the decline.
