RAYMOND MOLEY:
California Unions
Aim at Legislature
It has been my observa-
tion for a long time that
not more than 10% of the
voters in every State know
the names of their own
representatives in their
State Legislatures.
I would venture to add
that not more than 1%
know in any election who
the candidates for that of-
fice are or anything about
the members' voting rec-
ord. I suggest that anyone
reading this try the test on
his acquaintances.
These members and op-
posing candidates are the
little fellows at the bot-
tom of the ballot. They are
mostly picked by political
organizations or in prima-
ries in which the headlines
all go to the major candi-
dates. The humble annals
of their qualifications and
achievements are unre-
corded and unknown.

But over the past dec-
ade in California some
very important and power-
ful people have recognized
the importance of these
lowly statesmen and have
made it their business to
see that people of their
preference are elected.
With astonishing results.
Politically active labor
union leaders here in Los
Angeles and as far east as
Detroit, New York and
Washington have labored
quietly to elect candidates
who will do their bidding
and to defeat sitting mem-
bers of whom they disap-
prove. It happens that they
have worked for candi-
dates who have the label
of the Democratic Party
just as they have support-
ed, with some rare excep-
tions, Democratic candi-
dates generally. That is
part of their plan to cap-
ture that party district by
district, State by State and
finally, over the nation as
a whole.

It is neither difficult nor
costly to influence the
election of a State legisla-
tor. His needs never im-
press party donors of large
means. His own financial
support is meager and for
the most part his personal
means are limited. His par-
ty organization pretty
much ignores him and lav-
ishes its money and man-
power on the top dogs on
the ticket. Hence the poli-
tical machine of the unions
has easy going in a big
State like California.
I was able some months
ago to see a record of the
contributions made to
candidates for the Califor-
nia Legislature. For fa-
vored names there were in
many cases no less than
six contributions from spe-
cific unions. Since there is
no Taft-Hartley prohibi-
tion against labor organ-
izations' contributions to
offices other than Federal
these sums were no doubt
paid out of the general
funds of the unions.
And now in this cam-
paign these sponsors of a
captive Legislature openly
publicize their gains and
the objectives of their
quest. The figures given
are these:
★
In 1952 there were
elected to the California
Senate 29 Republicans and
11 Democrats and to the
Assembly 54 Republicans
and 26 Democrats. In 1954
25 Republicans and 15
Democrats were elected to
the Senate; 48 Republi-
cans and 32 Democrats to
the Assembly:
In 1956 the Senate was
evenly divided—20 and
20, while in the lower
house there were 43 Re-
publicans and 37 Demo-
crats. Last year Gov.
Knight told me that two
of the Republican Sena-
tors were generally Demo-
cratic in their voting pref-
erences. These two were
no doubt fully apprecia-
tive of the wrath that
might descend upon them
in 1958 unless they con-
formed.
The Democratic-union
coalition announces its ob-
jective this year as the ad-
dition of nine new Demo-
cratic Senators and 11 As-
semblymen. That, they
say, is what they "need,"
and unless somebody gets
aroused to what is hap-
pening the bag will be
well over that "need."

It is also announced that
this sort of control of the
Legislature is desired be-
cause, after the census of
1960, the State's Congres-
sional districts will be re-
drawn to accommodate the
minimum of seven new
members of the House of
Representatives in Wash-
ington. It would be simple
to do this with a pencil and
a map to create by legis-
lative fiat 25 Democratic
and 12 Republican dis-
tricts. The present align-
ment is 17 Republicans
and 13 Democrats.
An additional advantage
in the control of the Leg-
islature would be to pre-
vent any further regula-
tory laws regarding unions
and also, if the right to
work amendment were
passed, the pro-union Leg-
islature could nullify it by
passing no implementing
legislation and by block-
ing its enforcement.
