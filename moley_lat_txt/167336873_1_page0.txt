RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Dangerous Social
Security Proposal
Of all the bills before
Congress dealing with So-
cial Security the most
serious and controversial
is the Forand bill (HR
9467). It is said that its
authorship may be attrib-
uted to the AFL-CIO. In
any event, the AFL-CIO is
the most powerful and
vociferous advocate,
along with what has be-
come its affiliate, the
Americans for Democratic
Action.
¥
Opposed is the American
Medical Association. Also
opposed is the administra-
tion, which quite reason-
ably points out that any
such sweeping change re-
quires impartial investiga-
tion. Certainly, it would
seem a poor time to revo-
lutionize Social Security as
a quasi-recession cure and
at the tail end of a long
and politics-ridden session
of Congress.
The bill would provide
all qualified Old Age and
Survivors Insurance bene-
ficiaries with absolutely
free surgical and dental
services, hospital care for
up to 60 days a year, and
nursing home care for 120
days a year. It would also
materially increase the
cash benefits of all OASI
recipients, raise the tax-
able wage base from $4200
to $6000 a year, and in-
crease the Social Security
tax by .75% to reach 7%%
in 1975, and the income
tax on employees and the
excise tax on employers
by .5% to reach 9%% of
taxable payroll by 1975.
The bill would cover ap-
proximately 13,000,-
000 people.
★
This would be another
large advance toward total
government medicine. It
should be remembered
that something like 20,-
000,000 are already meas-
urably covered. These are
under various veterans'
benefits and the like.
Neither the AMA nor
anyone else who opposes
the Forand bill denies that
the high cost of illnesses is
a most serious problem,
especially for the aged.
Nor will anyone who has
been in a hospital deny
that our privately sup-
ported facilities for the
care of the sick are
strained to the utmost.
But the claim that the
aged cannot afford volun-
tary and private health in-
surance is hardly support-
able because 40% of them
are already protected by
some sort of voluntary
health insurance, and this
percentage is increasing
rapidly.
The AMA, recognizing
the need for some sort of
medical help for some of
the aged, joins the Eisen-
hower administration in
calling for a study of the
subject. For this purpose
the Joint Council to Im-
prove the Health Care of
the Aged has been formed,
with membership includ-
ing the AMA, the Ameri-
can Hospital Association,
the American Dental As-
sociation and the Ameri-
can Nursing Home Asso-
ciation.

It might be well to con-
sider some of the ways in
which the experience of
Great Britain with govern-
ment medicine has sharply
denied some of the rosy
promises of the Labor
government when the plan
was established. The sys-
tem there is now 10 years
old. It is being re-evalu-
ated right now by re-
sponsible students. On
some aspects there are
sharp differences but on
one there can be little
argument.
To explain this aspect
of British experience it
should be noted at the
outset that when the plan
was adopted there had
already been for some
time a partial system of
government aid to the
sick. But this older sys-
tem gave priority to the
genuine needy. In the
brave new world of Attlee
and Bevan any needs
test is degrading. It must
be for all—the needy and
the unneedy alike.
The result has been
that succeeding govern-
ments have had to meet
the inexorable limits of
public finances' as well as
the mushrooming of de-
mand because of the mul-
tiplication of hypochon-
driacs, and the available
money has been spread so
thin that the needy are
worse off than before.
*
This is the hard fact
that all of us should face
here in the United States.
We are rich enough to
care for the needy but we
can never meet the wants
of all. Until our welfare
staters admit this, we
shall move on and on to
the limits of our resources
however great they may
seem now.
