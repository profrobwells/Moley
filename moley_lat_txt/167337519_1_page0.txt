RAYMOND MOLEY:
Spending Keeps On
• as Recession Fades
Four months ago I not-
ed in this column that, ac-
cording to the calculations
and predictions of Her-
bert J. Miller, executive
director of the highly au-
thoritative Tax Founda-
tion, we should expect the
greatest spending splurge
in history.
At that time the reces-
sion was the excuse and
the pressure of politics
the real cause. The fiscal
picture now summarized
by the Tax Foundation as
we enter the new fiscal
year is even worse than
was anticipated. The re-
cession is leveling off but
the splurge accelerates.
*
Actual appropriations
during the present ses-
sion run 3 billion dollars
beyond the President's
budget, high as that was.
But, beyond that, author-
izations for various spend-
ing agencies to borrow
from the Treasury show
an increase of 5 billion
dollars more. Also, con-
tract authorizations ex-
ceed January recommen-
dations by $1,500,000,000.
Taking falling revenues
into account, this means
a 10-billion-dollar deficit
for the fiscal year begin-
ning this month. And con-
sidering that much of this
looks to long-range com-
mitments, spending will
jump some more a year
from now and two years
from now. Indeed, the
prospect for the future of-
fers no hope for tax re-
lief.
So-called "loan authori-
zations" are a much more
serious threat than straight
appropriations at this time.
Their drain on the Treas-
ury will be continuing for
a long time. They offer a
still more serious peril to
the control by Congress
and its committees over
spending, for they permit
agencies to borrow directly
from the Treasury, thus
bypassing Congress.
*
An excellent example of
this is the proposed Hous-
ing Act of 1958 which has
been approved and re-
ported to the Senate by the
Banking and Currency
Committee. This immense
program is proposed to be
added to the so-called
Emergency Housing Act
passed by both houses of
Congress and approved in
April. The latter commits
$1,900,000,000. The new
one before the Senate
would add to that amount
a sum of $2,800,000,000
from a wide variety of con-
struction programs. To-
gether they would be in
excess of $4,700,000,000.
Both of these measures
would authorize borrowing
from the Treasury directly
without review or ap-
proval of the Appropria-
tion Committees of the two
houses.
The immediate bill be-
fore Congress as reported
by the Banking and Cur-
rency Committee would
provide the $2,800,000,000
for additional mortgage in-
surance, FHA rental pro-
grams, urban renewal, ex-
tending college housing
programs and other pur-
poses.
There are still more
bills for this sort of spend-
ing in various stages in
Congress—an "area devel-
opment" bill, a small busi-
ness investment bill, a
school construction bill,
and an increase in authori-
zation for VA direct loans.
The amounts involved in
these total $950,000,000.
I should also note an-
other sort of spending au-
thority which will require
future appropriations.
Such authority carries
with it a certain moral
claim on appropriation
committees, although it
does not permit borrowing
from the Treasury direct-
ly. It exists in the giant
pork barrel for rivers and
harbors and flood control
repassed after a veto by
the President, salary in-
creases for government
employees, reimbursement
of the Commodity Credit
Corp., and a ship-construc-
tion appropriation bill.
The total of these is more
than 5 billion dollars.

In the face of these ex-
cess obligations, how can
anyone, including this ad-
ministration, suggest a
balanced budget in the
foreseeable future or any
relief from devastating in-
flation? True, the Presi-
dent might use the veto
ax on several billions of
this reckless spending. An-
other President, named
Grover Cleveland, won im-
mortality some 70 years
ago by such courageous
action, although he lost
the chance to be re-elected
in 1888.
President Eisenhower
has no such personal loss
to bear. But has he the
same grim courage for
which Cleveland was
known?
