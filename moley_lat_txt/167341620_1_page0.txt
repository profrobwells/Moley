The loudest voices in
the Northwest are those
of politicians who claim
that the public is enrap-
tured with the idea of pub-
lic ownership of the pro-
duction and distribution
of electricity.
This clamor, together
with the success at the
polls of Senators like
Morse, Neuberger, Mur-
ray, Magnuson and Jack-
son, has induced people
back east to believe that
these politicians have a
mandate for Socialized
power.
Many visits to the North-
west have convinced me
that this is not true. And
the hard facts prove, espe-
cially in the cases of Morse
and Neuberger, that the
labor unions, not the pow-
er issue, won them their
Senate seats.
New proof appears in
the results in Oregon in
the election this month.
There were three propos-
als before voters in that
State for government-fi-
nanced power projects. All
were defeated.
In Springfield, Or., the
voters were asked to pass
upon a proposal to take
over the facilities of the
Pacific Power & Light
Co., which had been in
competition with the city-
owned system. They vot-
ed in the negative and
now the company is pre-
pared to purchase the mu-
nicipal properties.
In Portland a bond issue
was on the ballot, which
would have built hydro-
power facilities for the
city. This lost, too.
In a State-wide vote a
proposed amendment to
the State constitution was
defeated. It would have
provided a Statewide gov-
ernment authority to go
into the power business.
This confirms the ver-
dict in a very considerable
number of Oregon coun-
ties that in past years
would have set up public
utility districts (called
PUDs). Since 1940 none
of these has been approved
by the voters.
In 1954, when Neuber-
ger won his Senate seat by
a margin of one vote per
precinct over a man who
scarcely started his cam-
paign before the polls
closed, three counties
were called upon to vote
on the PUD issue. One of
these was contiguous to
the Hells Canyon area. All
were defeated.
Up in Washington three
years ago an extraordi-
nary event took place in
Stevens County. The coun-
ty had a PUD which was
engaged in the power busi-
ness. Also in the county
were facilities of the
Washington Water Power
Co. On a proposal by the
president of the company,
Kinsey Robinson, a choice
was put to the voters. This
was that if three-fifths vot-
ed for the private compa-
ny it would buy out the
PUD and if three-fifths
voted for the PUD it
would buy out the compa-
ny. Seventy-one per cent
voted to have the company
buy out the PUD.
In recent years the si-
lent people who have the
votes seem to have real-
ized a simple factâ€”name-
ly that they want good,
cheap, dependable service.
The source from which
this comes is not essen-
tial. So far as fair prices
are concerned, that is a
matter to be regulated by
law.
Hence, rather than en-
trust a government agen-
cy with the job and pay
through taxes for the nec-
essary property, consum-
ers prefer to let the pri-
vate companies take the
risks, pay for the installa-
tions and give the service.
It is true that there are
a good many municipal
plants, as well as other
public power agencies, in
those States. Most of these
date back some years to
when the private compa-
nies were unable or un-
willing to provide the sort
of service the consumers
wanted. But times have
changed and so has the
quality of management of
companies.
Socialism is not a virtue
per se. There is no reason
why the public should
build and operate its own
means of satisfying its
needs when it can be
served by someone whose
business it is to serve and
please the customers. That
seems to be a simple an-
swer to all proposals for
Socialization.
