A recent article in the
Saturday Evening Post by
Stewart Alsop on "The
Mystery of Richard Nix-
on" is a remarkable ex-
ample of thoroughgoing
journalism.
But in journalism, espe-
cially in a signed article
which permits personal
judgments, an author must
be interpreted in the light
of his own predilections
and the kind of readers he
is seeking to convince.
Clearly, Alsop is inviting a
reappraisal of the Vice-
President by a large num-
ber of people who are only
partially emerging from a
strong suspicion, not to
say distrust, of Nixon.
Those people who con-
demned Nixon's campaign-
ing in 1954 and fought his
renomination in 1956 were
internationalist, welfare-
statish, and opposed to a
hard line at home against
Communist sympathizers.
Apparently Alsop was no
Nixon admirer, either.
I have somewhat differ-
ent predilections. I great-
ly admired the part played
by Nixon in unmasking
Alger Hiss — a service
which revealed to Amer-
icans the extent to which
Communism had infiltrat-
ed our government. I sym-
pathized with his conserv-
ative voting record on do-
mestic issues while he was
in the House, a record
which I examined careful-
ly when he was running
for the Senate in 1950.

Alsop only incidentally
mentions the Alger Hiss
case and never stresses
Nixon's conservatism in
economic affairs.
Nor can I condemn Nix-
on's much disputed cam-
paigning in 1954 when, ac-
cording to Alsop, he said
it was "wonderful" to have
a Secretary of State "who
isn't taken in by the Com-
munists." This was not
"sleazy" or "untrue." Both
Gen. Marshall and Dean
Acheson were utterly
hoodwinked by the Chi-
nese "agrarian reformers"
who were then and still
are hard-bitten Commu-
nists.
I thoroughly agree with
Alsop's conclusion that
Nixon is a brilliant politi-
cal strategist. No one else
has successfully passed
through so many crises
that might have ruined a
man's career.
The first of these was
the $18,000 fund case in
1952 when, despite the
vacillation of Candidate
Eisenhower, Nixon
emerged triumphantly.
The inspiration for his
strategy came from Rob-
ert Humphreys in the Re-
publican National Commit-
tee. But the maneuvering
was Nixon's.
The second crisis was
in the long months in 1956
when Nixon's enemies, in
and out of the administra-
tion, were opposed to his
renomination and the
President again vacillated.
Nixon conducted himself
with stoic patience until
Republican leaders over
the nation, nudged by Na-
tional Chairman Len Hall
and Humphreys, came to
his support and forced the
President's hand.
★
In my judgment a third
ordeal came when, after
the President's illness,
Sherman Adams called the
Vice-President to his own
office with the other "help"
to hear what the assistant
to the President intended
to do about running the
country. Any other man
holding the exalted office
of Vice-President would
have exploded at the af-
front. But patience, the in-
dispensable asset of a
good politician, prevailed.
Perhaps the Alsop piece
will leave many with
doubts about the "safety"
of such a brilliant politi-
cal tactician. I would re-
mind them that in politi-
cal life a leader deals with
a conglomerate public
which is capricious, whim-
sical, often confused, and
always diverse in its in-
terests. A statesman, not
only for the sake of his
own preservation but for
the ultimate good of the
public he serves, must
change emphasis on pub-
lic issues. A mere poli-
tician changes convictions.
A statesman shifts empha-
sis. In this sense Nixon is
an authentic statesman.
There is no new Nixon.
His convictions are un-
changed.
Such a masterful politi-
cal leader is at the mo-
ment a priceless asset to
a staggering Republican
Party. Moreover, Nixon's
profound belief in party
responsibility is an asset
to our liberties them-
selves, since they are so
dependent upon the main-
tenance of a strong two-
party system.
