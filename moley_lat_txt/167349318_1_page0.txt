NEW FIGHT
FOR POWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A conflict much more
intense and widespread
than the Helis Canyon con-
troversy is rising in the
Northwest. Again it seems
to be a basic issue between
a broad invasion of re-
source development, nota-
bly hydroelectric opera-
tions, by the Federal gov-
ernment and the policy in-
itiated by the Eisenhower
administration five years
ago-that of partnership
among local agencies, pri-
vate companies, and the
Federal government.

A good many years ago,
the Army engineers pre-
pared and submitted a
master plan for the devel-
opment of the Columbia
River and its tributaries.
This report is known fa-
miliarly as "308." In 1949
a revision of that plan
was prepared and submit-
ted to Congress. This re-
port is in eight volumes
which occupy 18 inches on
my shelves. It is replete
with descriptive material,
statistics, maps and the
like. It is a most illumi-
nating and comprehensive
treatment of the multi-
tudinous human uses that
are possible from the con-
trol of water in the agri-
cultural and industrial ac-
tivities of a great and
growing section of the
country.

Now the Army engineers
have produced a further
revision, equally compre-
hensive, which takes into
account the many public
and private developments
in the past nine years.

At the same time, Sen.
Neuberger has prepared a
a bill for the consideration
of the new Congress for
the creation of a Colum-
bia River Development
Corp. His bill would cre-
ate an agency which, ac-
cording to Neuberger,
would have "the responsi-
bility for and means of
supplying electricity needs
of all power consumers
and industries in the re-
gion who may request it."
The bill now under con-
sideration is a somewhat
revised edition of bills in-
troduced in the last Con-
gress on which there were
hearings in May and June.
Regional hearings were
held by Neuberger in vari-
ous places in the North-
west earlier this month.
This proposal, while con-
siderably different in some
details, is implicitly a new
version of a plan for a Co-
lumbia Valley Administra-
tion sponsored by the In-
terior Department during
the Truman administra-
tion. There was a long
fight then and the project
died. That proposal was,
to a large extent, modeled
after the TVA and would
have set up a sort of super
government over the
States in the Columbia
Valley. The idea has nev-
er died as an objective of
public power politicians.
Hence, the Neuberger bill
has substantially revived
the old fight.

★

This conflict, which will
be bitter and protracted,
will center about the dif-
ferences in the new ver-
sion of the Army-revised
"308" and the new plan
for a valley corporation.

Sen. Morse has been in
an epistolatory brawl with
his colleague and former
friend Neuberger. Never
have two U.S. Senators so
thoroughly laundered lin-
en in public since ante-
bellum days.

But in their opposition
to the plans of the Army
engineers they are joined
as never before. Water in
this case seems to be much
thicker than bad blood be-
tween them. Both have at-
tacked this scientific study
by an agency which has
always kept itself free
from political entangle-
ments.

All of which promises
that politics in the North-
west will not be in recess
between elections.
