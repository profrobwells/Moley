TAXPAYERS' RARE FRIENDS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Judge Howard Smith,
chairman of the House
Rules Committee, has
saved American taxpayers
several billion dollars dur-
ing this great spending
session of Congress. Never
did his strategy prove
more effective than in
stopping what U.S. Hous-
ing Commissioner Albert
M. Cole has called a "bil-
lion-and-three-quarter
dollar Christmas tree."
Despite prodding from
scores of his Democratic
colleagues and heated at-
tacks in the prospending
Washington press, Smith
took his time with the bill
before the Rules Commit-
tee and brought the meas-
ure down to the wire of
adjournment, where a
two-thirds majority of the
House would be required
to bring it to a vote.
The Eisenhower adminis-
tration, which has been
lavish in the business of
housing at government ex-
pense, finally gagged at
the monstrosity proposed
by the "liberal" Democrats
and passed by the Senate.
★
The bill proposed an ad-
ditional $500,000,000 for
the "special assistance"
housing program and
$500,000,000 a year for two
years for slum clearance
grants. It would have giv-
en $400,000,000 for the con-
struction of college dormi-
tories and housing for
student nurses and in-
terns. There were also
slipped into the bill $250,-
000,000 for college class-
rooms and scientific labo-
ratories.
The latter item was the
candy under the big tree
— a gesture for spending
based upon the Sputnik
scare. The bill would also
have liberalized FHA
down payments and other
loan provisions. Finally, it
would have provided an
extra $100,000,000 for
housing for the aged.
Thus, like most of the oth-
er omnibus measures that
have characterized the
proposals of this Congress,
there were what former
Secretary Folsom called
"lures and baits" for every-
one.
Clearly the measure was
a flagrant bid for votes,
conceived and rushed
through the Senate with-
out any real study of
needs, of the possible ef-
fect upon prices paid by
individuals struggling to
build their own homes and
colleges and attempting to
make ends meet with their
own money. Inflation was
written all over the meas-
ure.
These consequences
were forcibly expressed
by Commissioner Cole,
who pointed out that
"aside from hitting the
taxpayer and adding fur-
ther burdens to the Feder-
al Treasury, it would dis-
rupt the private housing
market and open the door
to another wave of infla-
tion and higher costs . . .
These provisions are pro-
posed when housing hap-
pens to be one of the
healthiest parts of our
economy. The housing rate
has risen to more than
1,000,000 units a year and
shows every sign of con-
tinuing to maintain a high
level."

A minority group of the
House Committee on Bank-
ing and Currency consist-
ing of Republicans back-
ing the administration's
objections to the bill said:
"Three principles char-
acterize this bill:
"If a lender or builder is
concerned, liberalize;
"If the government is
concerned, penalize;
"And if the typical con-
sumer is concerned—well,
he is all but the forgotten
man."
Opposition to the bill
consisted of an interesting
coalition. There was the
administration, which has
sponsored a lot of housing
and other spending but
found this proposal too
much. Then there were
the conservatives of both
parties in the House. This
alliance of strange bedfel-
lows does not mean unity
for life; but under the
leadership of Rules Chair-
man Smith it sufficed to
save us some money in
taxes and much more in
prices.
