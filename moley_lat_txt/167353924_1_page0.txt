RAYMOND MOLEY:
Knowland's Outlook
in November Election
At a public meeting
last week I was asked
whether the setback of
Sen. Knowland in the Cal-
ifornia primary would in-
dicate a great popular
surge against the right-to-
work cause there and
elsewhere.
My answer was that the
primary was hardly a test
of the issue, since no real
campaign was made on
that point at all. The
Democratic candidate and
his union supporters, on
the other hand, had cam-
paigned against right-to-
work for months. The pe-
titions for a right-to-work
amendment were still in
circulation during the
preprimary period, and no
effort by its supporters to
"sell" the idea has yet
been made.
There were, to be sure,
many other factors in the
primary results, and there
will be many deficiencies
to be corrected in the
next four months. But in
the atmosphere of Califor-
nia politics, nothing is
certain until the votes are
counted.
Speculation is in order
as to the possibility of
Knowland's reversing a
primary vote against him
amounting to a sizable
600,000. In pursuing such
speculation I am proceed-
ing on the assumption
that there is no use in
trying to win over the
Democratic vote for
Brown. The best hope is
to bestir a sufficient num-
ber of Republicans to vote
who were absent at the
primary and to win back
some of the Republicans
who voted for Brown.

A reversal of these pro-
portions has taken place in
California within the
memory of most of us.
That was in 1934, when
Upton Sinclair with his
revolutionary EPIC plan
ran ahead in the primaries
by 90,000, only to lose the
election to Gov. Merriam
by 260,000 in November.
In making such a com-
parison, it should be not-
ed that the population of
the State in 1958 is two
and a half-times what it
was in 1934. The registra-
tion now is more than
twice what it was then,
although the Democratic
advantage in registration
now is greater than in
1934.
The task before Know-
land is to gain relatively
as well as Merriam did 24
years ago. If he makes
such a gain, Knowland
would win in November
with a considerable mar-
gin, since the 350,000 gain
in 1934 would be 700,000
this year.

There are factors now,
however, which argue for
and against such a rever-
sal. A shrewd California
observer told me since
the primary that business-
men and others were
much more frightened by
the Sinclair plan than
they are by Brown. The
EPIC plan was so utterly
fantastic that four months
of reflection and plenty of
counterpropaganda awak-
ened the State.
On the other side, there
is the fact that 1934 saw
the utmost flowering of
the Roosevelt popularity.
Roosevelt himself be-
stowed his blessing, if not
his endorsement, upon
Sinclair, who paid a rev-
erent pilgrimage to Hyde
Park. In talking with me
at the time, Roosevelt ex-
pressed a decided prefer-
ence for Sinclair. The
Democrats swept the
country that fall, almost
obliterating the Republi-
can Party. Despite this,
Merriam won.

Perhaps such a rever-
sal is possible this year.
But it cannot come with-
out enormous efforts and
drastic changes in Know-
land management.
Nor can it be brought
about by an abject sur-
render to the Democratic-
union coalition. Since
Knowland has taken a
stand, he should stick to
it and give the California
voters a genuine choice
between two philosophies
of government. In this
faith he should be and
probably is willing to wa-
ger his political future.
