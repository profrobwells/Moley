Sen. John Kennedy and
many of his liberal col-
leagues in Congress used,
with a great deal of free-
dom during the recent
campaign, the term "full
employment" as the goal of
their associated efforts.
So it may be expected,
since these liberals were
so handsomely treated by
the voters, that the old de-
bate as to what the term
means and how much
government money must
be used to attain it will be
present in the next Con-
gress.
Union leaders, flushed
with confidence after elect-
ing so many new members
of Congress, will be mak-
ing ample demands at the
Congressional Joint Eco-
nomic Committee hear-
ings. Perhaps when Con-
gress meets an attempt
will be made to put the
word "full" back in the
law which was passed,
with considerable modifi-
cation, in 1946.

It is probable that the
expression "full employ-
ment" originated with the
British Labor Party. In
any event, it has been a
stock slogan in their cam-
paigns for many years.
In the original full-em-
ployment bill, introduced
by Sen. Murray and Rep.
Patman in 1946 — a bill
quite correctly called by
one commentator the "fool
employment bill"—it was
declared to be the policy
of the Federal government
to achieve full employment
by the expenditure of Fed-
eral money on public
works to whatever extent
was necessary beyond the
demands of private em-
ployment. It would have
involved vast and continu-
ing expenditures for pub-
lic projects.
Since the money neces-
sary for such great outlays
would have had to come
from taxation, with re-
strictive burdens on new
job-producing industry, a
vicious sequence would
have been put in motion,
and the result would have
been Socialism.
Sen. Taft struck at the
fallacies in the bill with
all of the great power of
his common sense. Large-
ly because of his influence
the measure was whittled
down to something like
rational proportions. The
word "full" was eliminat-
ed, "maximum" was sub-
stituted, and many other
qualifications were fixed.
However, the melody
lingers on in liberal cir-
cles and will have full
orchestration in the
COPE-influenced Congress
to come.
Ex-President Truman
gave the call to arms last
April when he appeared
before the House Banking
and Currency Committee.
At that time he was con-
fronted with an interview
which he gave to Arthur
Krock of the New York
Times when he was Pres-
ident. He had said at that
time that "a certain
amount of unemployment,
say from 3,000,000 to
5,000,000, is supportable."
In his characteristic man-
ner of escaping from
embarrassment, Truman
denied that any such in-
terview took place. Later,
he admitted it.
Now, considering the
rise in the civil labor force
since 1950 from about 63,-
000,000 to 70,000,000, there
would now be a normal
unemployment, according
to the Truman estimate,
of from 3,370,000 to 5,500,-
000. The figure 3,800,000
given by Sen. Kennedy as
the present problem
would not be alarming.
In the debate on the
subject in 1946 there was
complete confusion as to
what is meant by "maxi-
mum" employment and
also minimum, bedrock
unemployment. The fact
is that the present figure
is about a reasonable esti-
mate of unemployment
which may be expected,
considering the great rise
in the labor force.

Back in the early New
Deal days, when a real
problem existed, I heard
no end of experts say that
at least 2,000,000 was a
minimum unemployment
figure. This would incor-
porate those who could
not work or did not want
to work, or were unable to
get work. It would also
include the number who
are always between jobs.
Two factors would great-
ly increase the number
of normal unemployment
now. The first is the in-
crease in the working
force from 51,000,000 in
1933 to 70,000,000 in Sep-
tember, 1958. Another is
unemployment insurance,
which all will admit is
an inducement for many
thousands to linger be-
tween jobs. Thus our
present figure is really in-
dicative of a brisk state of
prosperity. Certainly it
should be no excuse to
begin a make-work spend-
ing splurge.
