ON TARIFF
ILLUSIONS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
After what seemed to be
interminable and unneces-
sary wrangling, Congress
has passed, in a compro-
mise form, the reciprocal
trade extension demanded
by the President.
The President's anxiety
about this measure seems
to be based upon a belief
that with plenty of trade-
concession carrots he can
induce foreign donkeys to
move in the direction he
thinks wise for them and
for us. Perhaps—and per-
haps not! I doubt whether
all the psychological war-
riors on the government
payroll at home and abroad
can estimate with any pre-
cision what is gained by
gratuities of this sort or by
gifts in hard cash. It is
difficult to argue a matter
of psychology, no matter
which side we take.

The fact is that recipro-
cal tariff arrangements
have been based largely
upon subjective consider-
ations from the time, early
in the Roosevelt-Hoover
campaign of 1932, when
they became a national is-
sue.
Well before Roosevelt
was nominated in the
spring of that year, the
vital political question
arose as to how the Haw-
ley-Smoot Tariff Act could
be attacked without lead-
ing the way to a counter-
charge that the Democrat-
ic candidate was going to
open the gates to foreign
competition at the expense
of American industry and
labor.
What seemed a happy
and harmless, political so-
lution would be to advo-
cate reciprocal tariff mak-
ing, which was comfort-
ably explained as good old
Yankee trading applied
to the international scene.
Politically, it was great
stuff because it had been a
Republican Secretary of
State, Blaine, who sparked
the idea and President Mc-
Kinley had endorsed it in
1901.
Later, after Roosevelt
was nominated, his Repub-
lican opponents began to
bombard him with embar-
rassing questions at almost
every whistle stop. "Do
you intend to reduce the
tariffs on this or that?"
—specifying articles of
great concern to the imme-
diate local economy. This
barrage got to be uncom-
fortable.

And so the Democratic
candidate began to hedge.
Sen. Cordell Hull's sug-
gestions were lost in the
preparation of the candi-
date's speech on the sub-
ject, which was prepared
in large part by two pro-
tectionists, Sens. Walsh of
Montana and Pittman of
Nevada. Thereupon Hull,
deeply hurt, went into al-
most complete silence.
Afterward, F. D. R. specifi-
cally promised not to re-
duce tariffs on farm prod-
ucts and, later, on indus-
trial items. That is the
way the campaign ended.
As the Roosevelt admin-
istration got under way,
the President was con-
vinced not only by con-
servatives but by national
planners like Tugwell that
the United States must
keep itself free to plan its
recovery without opening
its gates to foreign influ-
ences. Hull, momentarily
comforted by a reference
to reciprocal trade in the
Roosevelt inaugural
speech and plenty of soft
talk by the President, was
thrown into depression by
the President's refusal to
ask for a reciprocal bill in
1933.
*
Only later, in 1934, was
such a bill passed, but
even then it was hedged
with all sorts of provisos.
As we now know, tariffs
are a relatively outworn
way to regulate trade.
There are quotas, ex-
change restrictions and
many other more immedi-
ate tricks. Hence the pres-
ent renewal of the Recip-
rocal Trade Act, while
hailed as a great weapon
in the cold war, is not so
important in the actual
channels of trade.
What has really hap-
pened is that Congress,
happy to escape the pull-
ing and hauling to which
tariff-making in the past
has subjected it, has
passed the job over to the
President. Perhaps that is
a better way. And if there
is any psychological gain
we certainly need it.
