MORSE'S POLITICAL BOOMERANG
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
What happened was
this: On the Saturday be-
fore elections in Oregon,
there burst in the Oregon
press a charge against the
Republican candidate for
Governor, Mark Hatfield.
The charge was made by
Sen. Wayne Morse. It
threw his own party fol-
lowers, including Demo-
cratic Candidate Robert
Holmes, seeking re-elec-
tion, into utter consterna-
tion. It also loosed from
the people of the State a
vehement condemnation
of Morse's attack. The re-
sult was a big vote for
Hatfield which carried
him into office.
★
Morse brought up an in-
cident in the early life of
Hatfield which had been
well known to the Demo-
cratic high command, but
which it had firmly re-
fused to use. Eighteen
years ago when Hatfield
was 17, he had while driv-
ing his car struck and
killed a little girl of 7. It
was not a hit-and-run case,
for Hatfield had done all
that he could after the ac-
cident. His defense was
that he had not seen the
victim before he struck
her. But the courts decided
against him. Americans
have an admirable habit
of rejecting a man's past,
for which atonement has
been made, as a political
issue. This sense of fair-
ness Morse flagrantly of-
fended.
Morse is a lawyer who
was once dean of the Ore-
gon University Law
School. His defense for his
action has been that he
was not making the charge
because Hatfield had killed
the girl but because his de-
fense had been overruled
by the Supreme Court. The
Chief Justice of that court
at that time, now retired,
immediately overruled
Morse by pointing out that
to charge perjury in this
case would make a perjur-
er of every litigant who
ever lost a case.

But, while Morse poses
as a legal master, he is es-
sentially a professional or-
ator. As such, he faces
the awful peril—the occu-
pational disease that
threatens those who live
by that art. He has shown
symptoms of this malig-
nant weakness before—in
his implacable hatred of
the late Sen. Taft; in his
intemperate attacks upon
President Eisenhower, re-
cently culminating in lik-
ening the Chief Executive
to Dave Beck, and in oth-
er outbreaks of that sort,
along with his unbelieva-
bly absurd oratorical an-
tics on the floor of the Sen-
ate.
I knew Morse well when
he was at the Columbia
Law School in 1929. He
told me then that he was
writing a book on the ora-
tory of the elder La Fol-
lette. Prior to that he was
teaching public speaking
in Minnesota. For him,
then and always since, the
word—the spoken word—
is the beginning and the
end of things.
Now we see that the
word is first a servant,
then a master, then a cruel
tyrant and, finally, such a
man’s executioner.
There is what has been
called the awful “isolation
of the pulpit.” The orator
stands first in the legiti-
mate province of the advo-
cate, but gradually, as the
intoxicating influence of
the crowd dulls his senses,
he moves to the quick-
sands of agitation.
Finally, sensation must
mount upon sensation, or
the spell is broken. Ever
and ever the excited crowd
lures the speaker—to af-
firmation, to exhortation,
to vehemence, to vitupera-
tion. All must end in fail-
ure, for the crowd’s appe-
tite is illimitable. Unhappy
with the limitations of hu-
man speech, the crowd
turns from its magician in
resentment or in disgust.
The orator ends in ex-
haustion or tragedy or in
bathos.
Morse has come close
to the end of this trail. In
the new Congress his vote
will not be needed by the
party to which he turned
in passionate pique. Its
majority is very large. He
has created an enemy of
his junior, Sen. Neuberger.
He has injured his party
in Oregon, which regards
him as an insufferable
burden. He will be lonely
there and in Washington,
just as were those cap-
tured by their own excess-
es before—the Bleases, the
Heflins, and others.
Morse is literate. I
would suggest a course in
history. There he might
find plenty of clinical ex-
amples of famous orators
who were the victims of
their own words.
By the way, whatever
became of Charley Taft
and his committee, or
something, on clean poli-
tics?
