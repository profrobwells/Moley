RAYMOND MOLEY:
North Also Used
Nullification Threats
At this moment, when a
profound constitutional
conflict is in its prelimi-
nary stages between
Southern States and Fed-
eral authority, it will be
well to note that the North
as well as the South has
at times engaged in the
act of nulification.
To cite a great Ameri-
can historian, Charles A.
Beard, who, incidentally,
was my own professorial
adviser:
★
"As a matter of record,
from the foundation of the
republic, all factions were
for high nationalism or
low provincialism upon
occasion according to their
desires at the moment,
according to turns in the
balance of power. New
England nullified Federal
law when her commerce
was affected by the War
of 1812 and came out
stanchly for liberty and
union, one and insepa-
rable, now and forever,
in 1833 when South Caro-
lina attempted to nullify
a tariff act. Not long aft-
erward, the Legislature of
Massachusetts, dreading
the overweening strength
of the uthwest, protest-
ed warmly against the an-
nexation of Texas and re-
solved that 'such an act
of admission would have
no binding force what-
ever on the people of
Massachusetts.'
★
Smugglers Notch, Vt.,
near which I spent two
good months this summer,
is a reminder of how New
Englanders flouted Feder-
al authority at the time of
President Jefferson's em-
bargo prior to what New
England called Mr. Madi-
son's war. Through this
rocky defile, a lively trade
with Canada was carried
on despite all efforts of the
to
Federal government
prevent all intercourse.
At the approach of what
William H. Seward exact-
ly a century ago called the
"irrepressible conflict be-
tween opposing and endur-
ing forces," certain States
in the North resisted the
fugitive slave law. They re-
garded the law as an inva-
sion of their rights and a
violation of the Constitu-
tion. Thereupon, Chief Jus-
tice Taney read them a se-
vere lecture about "a gov-
ernment of laws."
One Northern State re-
plied through its Legisla-
ture that "the several
States... being sovereign
and independent, have the
unquestioned right to
judge of its (the Constitu-
tion's) infraction and that
a positive defiance by those
sovereignties of all unau-
thorized acts done or at-
tempted to be done under
the color of that instru-
ment is the rightful rem-
edy."
★
Beard concludes, after
citing these facts:
"...There can be but
one judgment in the court
of history; namely, that
major premises respecting
the nature of the Consti-
tution and deductions
made logically from them
with masterly eloquence
were minor factors in the
grand dispute as com-
pared with the interests,
desires, and passions that
lay deep in the hearts and
minds of the contestants."
I am not suggesting the
threat of armed conflict,
nor am I advocating any
violent means of resistance.
But the prevention of any
cold or hot conflict must
be accompanied by that
spirit of calmness which
borrows the time for the
cooling off of passion. For
the issue then and the is-
sue now are not unrelated,
except in degree.
