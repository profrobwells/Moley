RAYMOND MÜLET:
Scaring Businessman
on Civic Goodwill
An editorial has ap-
peared in at least one of a
very influential chain of
newspapers (I am not sure
whether it was printed in
others) which is so likely
to mislead businessmen
and others that it deserves
a reply.
It speaks of certain large
corporations which have
recently recommended
that their employees par-
ticipate in politics. It
draws an analogy between
using stockholders' money
for this and the use of dues
money by unions for their
activity. It speaks of "mak-
ing a right out of two
wrongs."
Not only does this edi-
torial misinterpret, per-
haps through ignorance,
what the corporations have
done recently, but the
analogy it seeks to draw
between current union ac-
tivity and that of the busi-
nessmen in question is not
a true one.
*
In the first place, as far
as I know of what corpora-
tions have done—and my
information on this is
quite ample—they have
not put their companies
into political activity. They
have said, in public state-
ments and in communica-
tions to their employees,
that it is the duty and re-
sponsibility of employees
to participate in political
affairs on their own. This
is good advice for every
man and woman in Ameri-
ca. One of the shames of
the times is the refusal of
Americans to do much
about choosing their pub-
lic officials. Indeed, mil-
lions do not trouble even
to vote.
No corporation that I
have heard of has actually
used corporation funds di-
rectly in behalf of a politi-
cal candidate or party.
They obey the old law of
1907 on that point. The
Taft-Hartley Act, which
puts the same prohibition
on labor unions, however,
is openly flouted. It should
be noted that these laws
apply only to Federal pri-
maries and elections.
The only attempt by the
present administration
through its Attorney Gen-
eral to enforce the Taft-
Hartley Act on this sub-
ject fizzled out. In the
trial of the case, which had
to do with the UAW, the
judge gave what seemed to
me inadequate instruc-
tions to the jury. Members
of the jury questioned
later indicated that they
did not know the law or
the facts sufficiently to
render an intelligent ver-
dict.
The analogy between
union members and stock-
holders is all wrong. No-
body is compelled to be a
stockholder. He is at lib-
erty at any moment to
sell out if he is not satis-
fied with the way a cor-
poration is using his
money.

But under a union shop,
a union member who dis-
agrees with the political
position of his officers on
an issue or a candidate
has his livelihood at stake.
Theoretically, he might
protest, or in some cases
get back that part of his
dues which is used in poli-
tics. But actually he
doesn't dare. Moreover, a
great deal of the political
activities of unions is
counted by them as "edu-
cation." In the UAW case
it was openly admitted by
the lawyer of the union
that "one cannot draw a
line between bargaining
and politics."
A very good statement
by W. L. White of what
the unions are doing in
politics is in the October
Reader's Digest.

In the hearings of the
Gore subcommittee on the
election of 1956, union rep-
resentatives openly told
what they thought they
could do with the general
funds of unions. They also
invited corporations to do
the same. As far as I
know, no corporation
would dare do the same
things with stockholders'
money.
Businessmen are scared
enough already because of
fear of the government, of
the unions, and of their
stockholders. This buga-
boo presented by the
newspaper editorial is like-
ly to deepen their fear
and confirm their present
neglect of a plain civic re-
sponsibility.
