RAYMOND MOLEY:
Johnson's Program
and Aims of Unions
The identity of the offi-
cial Democratic Party
with the now wholly polit-
ical AFL-CIO becomes
more and more apparent.
This close relationship,
alliance, or whatever you
choose to call it, has been
growing for 20 years—
since in the mid-1930s
President Roosevelt
switched his party aims to
the left and the CIO was
created under the power-
ful and sympathetic pa-
tronage of the national
government.
Perhaps it might be said
that the offspring has
adopted the parent, except
that it seems to be a mat-
ter of policy with the lib-
eral Democrats that there
shall be no responsibility
under Social Security
and pensions laws—for
children to care for aged
parents. (See the Demo-
cratic platform in Califor-
nia on that point.)
Merely to designate the
liberal and dominant wing
of the Democratic Party a
"labor" or "Socialist" par-
ty is an ineffective way of
getting over a real situa-
tion to the public. In the
first place, both the Dem-
ocrats and the union lead-
ers will deny such a thing.
And in the second place,
the American people will
not believe such a charac-
terization.

When you put a list of
welfare measures to a vot-
er, one by one, he will
generally approve, but the
extent of his approval of
individual measures will
add up to a program al-
most indistinguishable
from that of the British
Fabian Socialists. But
there is a fixed American
tradition that "it can't hap-
pen here."
Identification is easy,
under whatever name you
choose to use, and for the
purpose let it be "liberal
Democratic." Let us con-
sider the programs pre-
sented since the election
by Sen. Lyndon Johnson,
as undisputed spokesman
for the huge Democratic
Senate majority on the
one hand, and by George
Meany, speaking for the
AFL-CIO, on the other.
The following points in
the Johnson program are
substantially identical
with those of the AFL-
CIO: depressed-area relief,
a labor bill, presumably
the Kennedy-Ives version
watered down; peaceful
uses of atomic energy;
water conservation and
reclamation; "bold" hous-
ing program. His ideas on
foreign affairs would prob-
ably meet the approval of
the AFL-CIO, although
Meany, according to news-
paper reports of his inter-
view, omitted that.
Meany would perform a
major operation on the
Taft-Hartley Act. John-
son will have to do some
fancy work to stop it—if,
indeed, he will try to stop
it, considering the past
campaign promises of the
Senate majority he must
appease. The spending
potentiality of the John-
son-Meany plan can only
be estimated in general
terms, but it is certain to
be very high.

The identity is further
emphasized by the John-
son voting record as por-
trayed in the book on
"How Your Senators and
Representatives Voted,
1957-1958," of which the
AFL-CIO COPE distrib-
uted millions in the cam-
paign. On the 16 test
votes on which COPE
judged Senators, Johnson
deviated only three times.
These were against a new
Senate rule against fili-
buster, a civil rights bill
and an unemployment
compensation bill to ex-
tend the period of pay-
ment from 13 to 16 weeks.
Democratic Chairman
Paul Butler has promised
to demand the first two of
these.
The further fact is that
Senate majority members
have promises to keep.
They have taken the un-
ions' shilling and the help
of their organizers and
must conform or else be
marked for slaughter.
The alarming aspect of
the new Congress is that
it cannot stop, regardless
of the credit of the nation
or the constitutional bal-
ance of States versus the
Federal government. Ex-
cesses such as may be an-
ticipated will run their
course but at a most seri-
ous cost,
