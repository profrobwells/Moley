RAYMOND MOLEY:
Quarter of a Century
of Soviet Betrayals
The newspapers have
discussed the 25th anni-
versary of the recognition
of Soviet Russia, an event
which stirred great hopes
in this country on Nov. 16,
1933. They have also com-
mented on the great be-
trayal that followed.
It is idle to speculate
on the wisdom of Presi-
dent Roosevelt's decision
to offer recognition which
had been withheld by the
administrations of Wilson,
Harding, Coolidge, and
Hoover. The decision was
made in good faith. It was
a risk which was calcu-
lated with some care—
much more care than at-
tended many of Mr.
Roosevelt's decisions.
A year and a half be-
fore, when the Roosevelt
campaign was just get-
ting under way, the can-
didate was urged to come
out for recognition. On
one occasion at which I
was present, some of the
liberal advisers urged the
step. Sara Roosevelt, the
next President's mother,
an autocratic lady indeed,
said with fire that "if
Franklin does that, I will
break with him." Frank-
lin said nothing, and for
eight months after his in-
auguration made no
move. Finally, the risk
was taken.

In evaluating the
Roosevelt action it should
be kept in mind that he
was acting in the stand-
ard tradition of interna-
tional custom. This was to
recognize and open diplo-
matic relations with any
nation whose government
was de facto and stable.
In fact, "the other
Roosevelt," Theodore,
rushed to the recognition
of Panama while Ameri-
can forces were protect-
ing a smallish revolution
on the isthmus. This high-
handed act was repudiated
when Wilson succeeded in
getting Congress to
compensate the Republic
of Colombia for the dam-
age.
President Wilson broke
with tradition at the time
of the Huerta revolution
in Mexico, withholding
recognition on account of
his disapproval of the re-
gime there. It was that
policy of interpreting
recognition as approval
that was followed when
the Bolsheviks came into
power in Russia.
To seal the terms of rec-
ognition and to act as first
Ambassador, Stalin sent to
the United States the
smoothest, and perhaps
best disposed toward us,
of his commissars, Maxim
Litvinov. Litvinov and the
President made some
high-sounding agree-
ments.
In settling the Soviet
debt to us, we were more
than generous. The Presi-
dent even went so far as
to make an executive
agreement which substan-
tially denied private
American companies what
the Soviet owed them.
★
Livinov agreed "to re-
spect the indisputable
right of the United States
to order its own life and
to refrain from interfer-
ing in any manner in the
internal affairs of the
United States."
Despite this, the debt
agreements were not ful-
filled, and the Soviet es-
pionage penetrated and
corrupted elements in our
government, our press,
our foundations, and oth-
er aspects of our "inter-
nal affairs."
Nevertheless, the Soviet
was trusted officially until
long after President Roo-
sevelt's death. It is said
that in the short time left
to him after Yalta the
Roosevelt trust in Stalin
vanished, but there is little
evidence on this.
★
It is a sad story. But it
may be doubted whether,
considering the vast up-
heaval of the war which
made us allies against Ger-
many, the withholding of
recognition would have
helped.
The espionage would
have existed here in some
form, and the soft-headed
Americans who became
fellow travelers would still
have been active. The trag-
edy is that our government
failed to realize until long
after the hot war became
the cold war that we were
dealing with an enemy de-
termined to destroy us and
the civilization of which
we are a part.
