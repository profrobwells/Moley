THE LIBERAL WHIP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In an internal fight in
the Democratic Party in
New York State the will
of Tammany Leader Car-
mine DeSapio was im-
posed upon Gov. Harriman
and others and New York
County's Dist. Atty. Frank
S. Hogan was nominated
for U.S. Senator.

In his fear of the splinter
Liberal Party, Harriman,
as well as former Sen. Her-
bert Lehman and Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt,
wanted a Liberal favorite,
former Secretary of the
Air Force Thomas K. Fin-
letter.

The Liberal Party short-
ly before had nominated
Finletter, who almost im-
mediately declined the du-
bious honor of getting a
handful of votes in a hope-
less cause. Thereupon,
there were energetic ef-
forts by Democrats to win
over the Liberal Party to
endorse Hogan.

The Liberal Party, it
should be noted, is what
has remained of what was
known as the American
Labor Party, a private pre-
serve of the late Vito Mar-
cantonio.

Some years ago, with
Marcantonio voting the
Communist line in Con-
gress and his party infest-
ed with others of the Com-
munist stripe, the Liberal
Party was formed. It is
essentially controlled by
David Dubinsky of the In-
ternational Ladies Gar-
ment Workers. It puts up
so-called intellectuals as
State chairmen, such as
Prof. Adolph Berle Jr. of
Columbia and Prof. George
Counts of the Teachers
College. The membership
is generally regarded as
extreme liberals in the
current use of the word.

When the late Edward
Flynn was the leading fig-
ure of the New York Dem-
ocratic Party, he refused
endorsements by the Lib-
eral Party, since he was
shrewd enough to realize
that all that aggregation
amounted to was a sort of
pressure group to hold a
minority club over the
party which he sought to
preserve. In later years,
however, the Liberal Party
has had the cringing com-
pliance of Democratic can-
didates, since it holds a
balance of power in close
elections.

This was true in 1954
when it polled 262,000
votes and barely squeezed
Harriman through. This
year, with GOP Candidate
Nelson Rockefeller stand-
ing for about the same
principles as those of Lib-
eral-Democratic Candidate
Harriman, it seemed ter-
ribly important to get the
Liberal endorsement for
Hogan. Hence, Hogan was
compelled to go, hat in
hand, and beg for the
splinter party's endorse-
ment.

This party, with whip in
hand, demanded the an-
swers to a number of
questions, all reflecting
the ADA-collectivist line.
Hogan meekly complied
without reservations with
answers to a lot of issues
of which he was clearly
uninformed.

Yes, he would be for
Federal aid for education,
a lifting of the minimum
wage, more liberal hous-
ing, vigorous Federal com-
pulsion of integration in
schools, more foreign aid,
and all the rest of the line.
There is something re-
pellent in this willingness
to pledge, long in advance,
a candidate's votes in as
important and exalted
body as the U.S. Senate
without even a decent res-
ervation or two.

In 1956, with Stevenson
as its choice, the Liberal
Party polled 292,000 votes
in a total of 7,000,000.
Thus, the potency of a
splinter party is multiplied
many times its actual vot-
ing strength, and a large
party is made the creature
of a group only slightly
more than one-tenth its
size.
