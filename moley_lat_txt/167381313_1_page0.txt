THE IDENTICAL AIMS OF LABOR
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The new proclamation
of aims by the British La-
bor Party shows an almost
exact parallel with the
aims of the Democratic
labor alliance here. The
slight difference is what
makes the close identity all
the more obvious.
This ought to be the real
answer to the question so
often asked here: "Will
Reuther et al. form a la-
bor party?" My answer
to that is not "Never," for
I am unwilling in this
world of chance to use that
word. But I should say
that it would be strange
if a group which over
the nation is in firm pos-
session of a party with tra-
ditions, a name and what-
ever goodwill is involved
- flaunted a new name
which might excite and re-
pel the great number of
people who call themselves
"liberal" and who are not
in the labor movement, as
well as those who by hab-
it and tradition like to call
themselves Democrats.
During the 25 years
since President Roosevelt
proclaimed a New Deal
the objectives of American
liberals have become fair-
ly well formulated and un-
derstood. And the result
is that these objectives
have become almost iden-
tical with those of the Brit-
ish Labor Party, which
still likes to call itself "So-
cialist."
Let us examine the new
and beautifully printed
manifesto of Hugh Gait-
skell's party entitled
"The Future Labour Of-
fers You," selling current-
ly for sixpence and worth
it.
First comes the home.
The Labor Party wants
controlled rents. That is
an old story in many
places in the United States
including New York. It
would lend for homes at
low interest. We have it.
It would clear slums. We
are at it in a big way.
Moreover, the aims of the
new Congress as well as
those of the AFL-CIO and
the ADA all propose hous-
ing of all sorts, with gov-
ernment loans and subsi-
dies.
"Labour Offers" full em-
ployment. This was the
full-throated cry of Demo-
crats all over the United
States in the recent cam-
paign. Only in the United
States the liberals would
provide full employment
at government expense.
The British manifesto
doesn't go that far.
In education the British
Labor Party would set up
a royal commission to look
into education. We have
had our White House con-
ference and many commit-
tees and commissions at
work.
In health and medicine
the British have a nation-
al health service. The La-
bor Party thinks it is a
"boon to the nation."
There are many who think
otherwise. But when you
add up the Democratic lib-
erals' aims and those of the
AFL-CIO you would have
something very close to it.
It is most interesting
that the Labor Party backs
completely away from
price controls. But the net
of the advice of economists
such as Galbraith and Key-
serling, who are the intel-
lectual guides of the Dem-
ocratic-labor alliance, is to
try that as a cure for infla-
tion.
Pensions and old-age as-
sistance: We have them
and will get more. So do
the British, and the Labor
Party would give more.
Only on nationalization
would the British proto-
types of our"forward-look-
ers" go a bit further. But
their proposal is milk and
water compared to their
attempts when they were
in power. It simply didn't
work. And so they would
not go beyond restoring
steel to "full public own-
ership" along with "road
haulage."
So far as steel is con-
cerned, the government
still owns nearly half of
the industry in Britain but
private owners control it.
So far as "road haulage"
is concerned, consider the
uproar by Hoffa and other
unions if such a thing
were tried. They know
that it is one thing to use
terrorism, sabotage and
racketeering against de-
fenseless owners here and
another to try such prac-
tices against the govern-
ment of the United States.
And so we have a paral-
lel between our leftists
and those over the seas.
Why should anyone want
a labor party? We prac-
tically have it, nicely la-
beled, as it is.
