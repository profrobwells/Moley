CHARLOTTESVILLE,
Va.—It has been generally
noted that one result of
enforced integration in
public schools, is the retreat
of parents, opposed
to federal policy, to the
alternative of private
schools.
In Virginia, where the
effort of state authority to
maintain segregation in
public education has yielded
to court orders, Gov. J.
Lindsay Almond has already
gone a considerable way in
the encouragement
of private education.
*
This, as it is explained,
will be accomplished in
part by tuition aid from
the state government for
pupils who attend private
schools and, beyond that,
by parents who are willing
to assume the expense in
addition to the taxes they
pay for public schools.
This pattern may in the
long run be adopted all
over the South.
This manifestation of
individual responsibility
for education should suggest
to all of us that the
public school system
hailed over the generations
in thousands of orations as
the one and only
cradle of democracy has
never been exactly that.
Private schools have supplemented
public education in all the
years since education was,
in fact, all private.
*
In the last 18 years
the relative attendance at
private schools in the
United States has increased
at a very much
higher rate than public
school attendance. This
was happening long before
the issue was raised
by the Supreme Court in
1954.
This growth has in part
been due to increasing
doubt about the quality of
public school education—a
doubt justified by a rising
array of facts concerning
what is being taught by
modern educators and
how they are teaching it.
The inadequacy of what
is taught and how it is
taught is especially notable
in the large centers of
population, where control
and scrutiny of schools
have moved farther and
farther from the parents.
In cities like New York,
Chicago and Philadelphia
what the children are
taught and who shall teach
them are vested in a vast
governmental bureaucracy.
The old days when parents
visited the schools on
stated days, conferred
with teachers as a matter
of course and made it a
major concern to keep a
sharp eye on what was going
on at school are quite
remote from present conditions.
★
Parents not only have
grown more conscious of
this remoteness, but in
thousands of cases are
willing at their own expense
to exercise freedom
of choice as to the sort of
children with whom they
want their children to associate.
Moreover, parents who
regard sound religious
training in the faith of
their fathers as essential
have preferred privately
supported parochial
schools.
To make such choices
on their own is an American
right.
Millions have moved
from the cities to the suburbs
because they have
preferred schools which
can be more closely
watched by parents.
It is undeniable that an
essential function of modern
free government is to
provide education for all
at public expense, and also
to compel attendance by
all at some school.
★
But to force all children
into public schools would
be the supreme act of totalitarianism.
Hence, the American
solution is to provide such
public education, but at
the same time to permit
those whose preference is
private schooling to make
use of it at their expense.
