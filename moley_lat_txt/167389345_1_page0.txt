RAYMOND MOLEY:
Farm Bureau Chief
on Federal Policies
Despite many years of
political muddling, the
farmer must still depend
upon his own and upon co-
operative efforts to solve
his problem of surpluses.
President Charles B.
Schuman, in his annual ad-
dress this week to the
American Farm Bureau
Federation, confirmed this
in some plain words:
"If the family farm is
to remain strong and com-
petitive we need to make
sure that family farm op-
erators are permitted to
adjust to meet changing
conditions. The govern-
ment acreage control and
price fixing programs of
the past 25 years have dis-
couraged needed adjust-
ments and stimulated the
production of large quan-
tities of crops that con-
sumers did not want.
"The result of these un-
wise political decisions is
that thousands of family
farm operators have not
made adjustments to
changes which are inevita-
ble. Their future is jeop-
ardized by the very pro-
grams which were suppos-
edly intended to help
them . . . The billions of
dollars spent on price sup-
port purchases and subsidy
payments have not added
to farm incomeâ€”they have
only been an offset against
the losses that farmers
have suffered as a result of
restricted production, in-
creased costs of operation
and surplus-depressed
prices under the programs.

"Many panaceas will be
proposed to the new Con-
gress . . . Those who be-
lieve in government direc-
tion of individuals and
those who do not recog-
nize that our successful
system in this country de-
pends upon freedom of in-
dividuals to choose al-
ways advocate more gov-
ernment controls over the
economy when faced with
the failure of current pro-
grams . . .
"Most of the so-called
new proposals being of-
fered have the same built-
in weaknesses that
brought failure to past
programs and would, if
adopted, accelerate the
trends toward socialized
agriculture."
This statement of the
plain facts is in line with
the long record of this fed-
eration, the largest of all
farm organizations. Pres-
ident Schuman would not
discontinue all govern-
ment interference. But
what he further suggests
in this speech are meas-
ures to help farmers to-
ward the true objective of
a free market.
His proposals are these:
First, discontinue all acre-
age and production con-
trols and use the soil bank
to ease adjustments for a
short time; second, use a
percentage of the previous
three-year market price as
a basis of support for those
products that have been
price fixed, and, third,
freeze existing stocks in
the Commodity Credit
Corp. so that they will not
compete with new crops.
Then get rid of existing
government-held stocks to
nations in distress or
which could not normally
purchase such commodi-
ties in the world market.

Schuman also had some
worth-while comments on
the perils to everyone in
inflationary spending. No
one, he said, profits in the
long run from such a pol-
icy of diminishing the dol-
lar except bureaucrats,
speculators, and those who
would destroy the free en-
terprise system entirely.
So far as organized labor
is concerned, he said that
the monopoly in economic
and political life which is
sought by some labor
union leaders would, if
pressed to its ultimate,
destroy the very system
upon which good wages
and high living standards
depend.
Whether this warning,
coming from the head of
a powerful organization,
will have any appreciable
effect upon the new Con-
gress remains to be seen.
For in the course of time
the strongest support for
the regimentation and sub-
sidizing of the farmer has
come to be the unions
rather than the fast-disap-
pearing farm bloc. This
support from Reuther and
others has two motives:
First, to subsidize food
purchased by workers in
industry, and, next, to
keep farmers on the farm
and off the labor market.
This new angle to the so-
called farm problem is
most significant and dan-
gerous.
