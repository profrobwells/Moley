Republicans, soundly
beaten, are now searching
for the formula that will
bring victory in 1960.
They might well look to
sources of wise politicking:
the AFL-CIO COPE and
the Conservative Party in
England. Both of these po-
litical groups stress organ-
ization, with a minor note
on policy. Many Republi-
cans, however, are madly
looking for some sweet
elixir of words as a party
faith or for a shining fig-
ure of a candidate—expe-
rience in politics unneces-
sary—to keep the party in
the White House and to
put it back in Congress.
Here is the fatal fallacy
of American conserva-
tives, most of them sound,
practical and successful in
all walks of life—except in
politics. I would be the
last to deny that Republi-
cans need a short, explicit
statement of principles—
something sharply oppo-
site the spend-giveaway-
more government formula
of liberal Democrats and
their pals and supporters,
the AFL-CIO and the
ADA. To supply such a
statement of principles,
however, should not be
difficult. It could be said
in the space occupied by
this column and could be
written just as quickly.

But people are not go-
ing to come flocking to
the polls because of a
rhapsody of words. Ameri-
cans are wary of words
and promises. If in 1952
and 1956 words could have
won Adlai Stevenson
would now be finishing
his second term.
Nor do I completely ig-
nore the need for fresh,
new Republican candi-
dates. This was proved in
many a Congressional race
last month.
But organization is the
thing. There should be
the introduction of more
systematic, vigorous pre-
cinct work everywhere,
more dependence on pro-
fessional, year-round paid
employees. There should
be more personal contact
with men and women—
on the doorsteps, in the
living rooms and kitchens,
over the fences and in the
shops and saloons of
America. That sounds very
simple but it is also very
hard work.
The AFL-CIO’S COPE
and the successful British
Conservative Party know
this system and have prac-
ticed it with miraculous
success.
Also they know they
should not waste time try-
ing to convert the opposi-
tion. Their job has been
to get at sympathetic but
lethargic voters by per-
sonal contacts and to get
these people to the polls
on election day.

The figures in four Brit-
ish elections show this.
There was no great dimi-
nution in the Labor Party
vote in 1950, when the
Conservatives defeated
more than 150 Labor mem-
bers of Parliament who
had been elected in the
great sweep of 1945. In
1951, when the Conserva-
tives got an MP majority
of their own, Labor still
had more popular votes
over the nation. The fig-
ures in 1945 were 12,000,-
000 Labor votes to 10,000,-
000 Conservative. In 1950
Labor, while losing most
of their MP majority,
polled nearly a million
more than the Conserva-
tives. In 1951 Labor got
700,000 more than in
1950 but they lost their
majority in the House of
Commons completely.
What happened? Con-
servatives, through a very
efficient organization, con-
centrated in constituen-
cies where they knew
there were many middle-
class people, many of
them former Liberals, and
practically conceded to
Labor the districts where
the big Labor vote was
concentrated. Power in
Britain is not based on a
national popularity con-
test. It comes from elect-
ing more MPs than the
opposition.
This is the sort of thing
that Republicans must un-
derstand if they are ever
to recover control in Con-
gress and retain the White
House.
