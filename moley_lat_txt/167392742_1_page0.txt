RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nixon Facing Task
of Rebuilding GOP
Since the election I have
spent several days in the
West and Midwest and find
that the most commonly
asked question is, "Who
will be nominated in
1960?" This involves, as
always in so long a period
before the event, a good
deal of useless and futile
speculation.
As far as the most fre-
quently mentioned name
is concerned on the Repub-
lican side, Vice-President
Nixon, the answer might
be: "Will a Republican
nomination that year be
worth having?"
But since off-year elec-
tions in the past have al-
most always gone against
the party having posses-
sion of the White House,
it is altogether off the
mark to assume that a Re-
publican cannot win. How-
ever, the weaknesses in
the Republican Party
manifested last month are
of importance, and since
Nixon is the one whose in-
terests are most concerned
in eliminating those weak-
nesses, he becomes the in-
dividual charged with the
repair job.
At the moment, specula-
tion seems to be concen-
trated on the Rockefeller
"threat" to Nixon's
chances for the nomina-
tion. Some are fond of
drawing a parallel between
the Nixon candidacy and
that of the late Sen. Taft
in 1948 and in 1952.
*
It is undoubtedly true
that there will be efforts
to push Rockefeller as a
rival to the Vice-President.
The same interests and in-
dividuals will be concerned
in such efforts as were ac-
tive in behalf of Wendell
Willkie in 1940 and
Dwight Eisenhower in
1952.
Stassen has popped his
head out of the rubble of
his defeat in Pennsylvania
to threaten that he will be
a candidate. He says that
he will not be a candidate
"in a real sense," but only
to hurt Nixon. Well, Stas-
sen never was a candidate
"in a real sense." In 1952
a very wealthy Texan con-
tributed to Stassen's silly
quest not because he be-
lieved in him but to hurt
Taft.
These stop-Nixon people
are mainly what have
come to be called "mod-
ern" Republicans. Curious-
ly enough, since they
claim to be more "liberal"
than the Republican regu-
lars in the Midwest and
West, they are concen-
trated in eastern financial
centers; many work in
Wall St. and live on Park
Ave. They are well
equipped with money, and
they receive plenty of sup-
port from some big metro-
politan newspapers and
Madison Ave. publicity
firms.
Their tactics follow a
pattern. First, they tear
down the favorite of the
regulars-largely by claim-
ing that he cannot win.
Then, with all their power,
they build their man as
one who is "fresh, progres-
sive, and forward-looking."
It was so with the Willkie
and Eisenhower blitzes. It
may be so with Rockefeller,
if he does nothing to stop
it.
â˜…
But the parallel between
the Nixon cause and that
of Taft needs a good deal
of qualification. Taft la-
bored indefatigably and
was a towering statesman.
But he was always ham-
pered by his choice of
managers. They made
damaging mistakes, such
as the critical moment in
the 1952 convention when
they sought to hold more
members of the Texas del-
egation than, in fact, they
were entitled to claim. It
was that fatal decision,
after plenty of others in
the weeks before, that
turned the tide and lost
Taft the nomination.
Nixon's opposition will
find that they are dealing
with a vastly more astute
politician than was Taft.
His choice of managers in
earlier campaigns has al-
ways been notable. One
of his most recent acquisi-
tions has been Robert
Finch, who was for some
time executive for a re-
markably effective group
in Los Angeles called Re-
publican Associates.
But the Vice-President
himself is the master strat-
egist with whom his oppo-
sition must deal. And he
has, in addition to his own
native ability, the exalted
office of Vice-President as
a forum. Most important,
he is more familiar with
the many problems that
are scattered over the par-
ty organizations in the
States.
*
His comprehension of
organizational methods is
ample and he makes no
mistake in believing that
issues rather than organ-
ization win elections. Shap-
ing up and popularizing a
party faith and philosophy
will be a major task for
him.
Finally, he is in a posi-
tion to encourage the nom-
ination of more attractive
candidates for elective of-
fices in the States and Con-
gressional districts. The
party needs all three com-
ponents-better and more
efficient organization, good
candidates at the local and
State levels and a compre-
hensive set of policies.
These it will be Nixon's
destiny to produce in the
18 months ahead.
