PRINCIPLES
FOR ALL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Before one-twentieth of
the returns were in on
election night, there was
plenty of gabble on the
national, not local, broad-
casting stations.
We heard all about the
coming conflict for the Re-
publican nomination in
1960, with Nixon and
Rockefeller as deadly ri-
vals, and with "modern"
Republicanism and "reac-
tionaries" locked in bloody
battle. I can realize that
on election night people
are borrowed from soap
operas, entertainment, and
routine reporting, and that
the periods between re-
turns must be filled with
talk. A great proportion of
those who provided the
talk were unfriendly to
the Republican Party and
conservatism generally.
I cannot make the com-
ment above without say-
ing that a shining excep-
tion has always been Wal-
ter Cronkhite, the finest,
fairest and most coherent
broadcaster on the nation-
al waves today.

This emphasis on Re-
publican disunity is an old
story. And the tragedy is
that so many Republicans
have been more concerned
in criticizing their own
party than in attacking
the opposition. This has
been cunningly encour-
aged by Democratic lead-
ers. But it could not suc-
ceed against a party which
had clear leadership and a
faith of its own.
Now let us consider this
so-called rift in the Repub-
lican Party between "mod-
ern" Republicans and Re-
publicans—period. What
is all this shooting about,
and what can be done
about it?
There has been a differ-
ence in viewpoint within
the Republican Party for
more than 70 years. The
eastern wing, centered in
New York and Wall Street,
was international in out-
look and, largely because
of its international bank-
ing connections, favored
low tariffs and more for-
eign trade and banking.
The midwestern point of
view was protectionist be-
cause of industrial and
farming interests. "Mod-
ern" Republicanism is
rooted in this difference in
outlook, although the tar-
iff is no longer a matter
of importance, so far as
politics is concerned. How-
ever, in basic issues there
are no real differences—
certainly none that could
not be bridged by reason-
able people.

There is something,
however, in semantic dif-
ferences. Republicans gen-
erally resent any group
that calls itself "new" or
"modern" because it be-
speaks an attitude that
others, under the simple
name "Republican," have
something wrong with
them.
Perhaps if some mem-
bers of the entirely worthy
sect of Holy Rollers began
to call themselves "new"
or "modern," the elders of
the denomination would
take offense. They would
think that some upstarts
were implying that they
were not "holy" or that
they did not "roll" very
well.
★
Our unfortunate Presi-
dent probably unwittingly
produced such a schism by
refurbishing the party,
getting "young, forward-
looking" people into office,
and so on. But people in
whom he had confidence
began making a fetish out
of these terms.
It might be well in the
present instance for the
President, or, better still,
the Vice-President, to call
together party leaders, re-
cently created lame-duck
Senators, hold-over Sena-
tors, and others for a
week's conference—not in
Washington. They should
then create a statement of
Republican faith on which
all can stand and which
clearly and unequivocally
differentiates Republican-
ism from that liberalism
which characterizes the
big majority of the next
Congress.
Vice-President Nixon is
eminently the man who
could dominate such a con-
ference, for he knows all
sorts of Republicans and
also has valiantly support-
ed them in the heat of
many campaigns. Then
stop the bickering and join
in fighting Democrats rath-
er than each other.
