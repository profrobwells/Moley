Strange to say, the pol
itician who is close to the
hard facts of life at all
times is slow to realize
how rapidly those facts
are changing. What we
call the professional poli-
tician fumbles the same
old papers, peruses the
same old registration lists,
sees the same people,
plods along in the same
routine as his predeces-
sors did for generations.
If he is in a district safe-
ly on the side of his party,
he is content to count on
his sure majority, with lit-
tle effort to improve the
quality of his organiza-
tion or to watch the
changes that are taking
place in his voting con-
stituency. If he is in a dis-
trict in which his party
never wins, he plods along
—inured to defeat, getting
the little drops of patron-
age that come his way
from a national or State
administration which hap-
pens to be of his party. He
would be terribly upset if,
in a sweep, his party hap-
pened to win in the dis-
trict.

I live in such a hopeless
Republican district in New
York City. The tiny drib-
bles of patronage come
from an occasional receiv-
ership from some of the
Republican judges that sit
in the county or from the
small jobs passed out in
the Post Office at Christ-
mas time. Nothing changes
much, although in the last
two years 4000 people have
moved into the district
and would be good hunt-
ing for a Republican or-
ganization.
It is time to reappraise
and reconstruct the con-
cept of a professional poli-
tician in this country.
What we have always
called the "professionals"
are people who spend a
considerable part of their
time in political affairs.
They may hold a party of-
fice as local or county
chairmen or they may
have a job at the court-
house or City Hall. They
peddle small favors to
small businesses or law-
yers or others. But their
political methods are as
antiquated as hand-
cranked telephones and
kerosene lamps.
The greatest need in
politics today is for profes-
sionalism. Organized labor
has recognized this, and
its methods—so effective
in the last 10 years—have
brought results. Their pro-
fessionals are men and
women trained in the
rough and ready politics of
labor organization. But
they get plenty of real,
even formal, instruction
in every form of precinct
work, in how to make
friends, in how to present
a case in a manner that
will move voters.

Outside of that, in (tradi-
tionally Democratic as
well as Republican com-
munities, and also in busi-
ness-in-politics, complete
modernization is needed,
including formal teaching
in political methods of the
most effective, improved
forms.
Training of this sort is
not centered anywhere.
But if some man of means
who deplores the prospect
of a one-party govern-
ment with the new liberal-
ism rampant would spend
a few million dollars in
establishing a real insti-
tute of politics, smallish
but expertly directed, to
train professional workers
and to do a job of research,
he might change the
course of political life in
10 years.
I am not thinking of a
Republican school or a
Democratic school, al-
though there ought to be
one for each party. But
there should be a school
or institute to impart mod-
ern methods of political ac-
tion and to do the think-
ing and research neces-
sary to enlarge and mod-
ernize those methods. Pol-
itics is not a game or a
leisure-time matter, or a
hobby. It should be a real
profession — decent, re-
spected, essential to the
preservation of all the val-
ues now given only lip-
service by Americans.
