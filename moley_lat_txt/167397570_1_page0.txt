Polls, Statistics, Common Sense---
and Political Prospects for 1960
This piece is written in
California, a state which
probably has more reason
to expect a Democratic
victory in the Presidential
election in 1960 than any
other commonwealth.
Nowhere was the 1958
blow more severely felt.
Republican congressmen,
state legislators and the
governorship were swept
over the dam. And, quite
naturally, the smog of
pessimism which swept
Republicans all over the
nation is pretty deep here.
The Republican Nation-
al Committee meeting in
January in Des Moines did
plenty of breast beating,
which was probably whole-
some. A few mea culpas
are good for any sorely af-
flicted soul.
Democrats over the na-
tion have been assuming
that about their only prob-
lem now is to select the
next President from an as-
sortment of aspirants.
They believe that the
AFL-CIO COPE will get
out the necessary votes
for them.

This is the sort of situa-
tion, however, in which
realistic students of poli-
tics always find excellent
material for some devas-
tating analysis. For in po-
litical life, as in sports,
when excessive depression
confronts excessive con-
fidence wise ones antici-
pate an upset.
If I found the role of
prophet comfortable,
which I never do, I would
join with those wise ones.
For a bit of analysis pre-
sents a far. different pros-
pect than is anticipated by
most people.
There are four means
which are commonly used
to anticipate future events
in politics: historical prece-
dent, statistics, polls, and a
logical appraisal of obvi-
ous facts. The last is para-
mount.
My conclusion, after a
lot of history reading, has
impressed me with the
conviction that in a mat-
ter like this it is a treacher-
ous guide. It is as likely to
reverse itself as to repeat.
For the facts are never the
same.
Statistics are tricky
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
when used to evaluate a
market or a political situa-
tion. They are useful to an
observer who is able to
take a lot of nonstatistical
facts into account. They
are a crutch but a poor
substitute for a head and
legs. In the present case
the Congressional Quarter-
ly has produced a fine, ex-
haustive survey of the 1958
election statistics demon-
strating that a Republican
can be elected President in
1960 even if the congres-
sional results in that year
are as heavily Democratic
as they were last year.
Polls are even more
tricky than statistics.
There are unfortunately
among the pollees so many
prevaricators, wobblers
and dumb ones that when
all is assessed the margin
of guesswork is tremen-
dous.
So let us fall back on
logic, common sense and
a few facts available to
all.
The average American
voter approaches his de-
cision in selecting a Pres-
ident in quite a different
mood from that in when
he votes for a congress-
man, a state legislator or
a councilman. In the lat-
ter cases he knows the
candidates personally.
They are neighbors and
his evaluation of their per-
sonalities weighs heavily.
Ideology is not much of a
consideration. "Nice guys"
have a big advantage.
*
But something of the
solemnity of the choice of
a President known only as
a distant figure weighs
heavily upon the voter.
The job is so big that
there is vastly more in-
terest in the choice. Half
again as many people take
the trouble to vote for a
President as for local can-
didates.
The larger turnout
means that a vast new seg-
ment of the voting popula-
tion 'is activated. And I
have the firm conviction
that this segment, sad as
it may be, encompasses a
considerable part of the
otherwise good people
who save and work and
believe in tradition and
the verities of life.
The election of 1958 was
an organized victory in
which the AFL-CIO COPE
skillfully concentrated its
limited power and re-
sources on the marginal
spots. It has neither the
means nor the capacity to
spread itself over a na-
tion. And in the elections
of 1948, 1952 and 1956 it
was only indifferently in-
terested in the Presidency.
What it wanted was to in-
fluence legislation.
Foreign affairs provide
a tremendous emotional
factor in the determina-
tion of voters' choices. For
the dread apparition of the
threat of war moves us all.
Voters are going to con-
trast the troubled but
peaceful years under Ei-
senhower and Dulles with
the years 1945-53 when
communism was permit-
ted to overrun half the
world.
*
With a candidate like
Vice-President Nixon, who
is able to portray our for-
eign problems and who
can commend himself as
most experienced in high
affairs, voters of both par-
ties will respond favorably
as against the claim of any
Democrat who claims that
there is a certain indefin-
able something better
than keeping the peace.
Whatever may be the
external confidence of
Democrats, the thoughtful
ones in the party are not
happy at the offerings in
their supermarket of can-
didates. Some are green
and some are overripe.
There are health hazards
among them, a problem
with which Republicans
will probably have no
concern this time.
Certainly, there are no
Roosevelts among the as-
pirants-none whose name
is a household word. Some
are not even nationally
known. All have political
or personal handicaps.
These are considerations
which should warn any-
one to wager nothing on a
Democratic President for
1961. But, of course, time
and chance may alter this
array of facts. The future
is still ahead.
