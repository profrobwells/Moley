It is strange to find
British peers of the realm,
the Norwegian Shipown-
ers' Association, and Joe
Curran's National Mari-
time Union in the same
boat. Jimmy Hoffa is
standing by to throw in his
Teamsters with the in-
congruous group. All these
interests are, to use a mild
term, energetically threat-
ening an essential expan-
sion of American industry
and, in fact, the basic se-
curity of the American na-
tion.
Some weeks ago, I com-
mented in one of these
columns about "flags of
necessity," referring to the
registration of cargo ships
under flags of such nations
as Panama and Liberia.
This article gravely upset
Mr. R. D. Ropner, presi-
dent of the British Cham-
ber of Shipping, because I
erroneously identified Brit-
ish-owned ships with Li-
berian registry. The
astonishing point is that
little Liberia has more
tanker tonnage under her
flag than has the "Queen
of the Seas" or the Stars
and Stripes.

A major problem in
shipping, in the face of
heavy domestic taxation,
is to accumulate funds
necessary for construction.
Liberian and Panamanian
registration offers Ameri-
can shipping, apart from
that segment along the
trade routes defined by the
government as essential
for subsidy, a necessary
solution. The British have
developed a method of
meeting their problem of
taxation and financing of
new ships by registration
in Bermuda and the Ba-
hamas. The distinction is
that British sovereignty
extends over Bermuda
and the Bahamas. Liberia
and Panama, while sub-
stantially created by the
United States and econom-
ically allied with us, are,
because of American aver-
sion to political imperial-
ism, independent nations.
The distinction is, in
reality, not an essential dif-
ference.

British members of the
House of Lords, notably
gentlemen with extensive
shipping interests them-
selves, have raised their
voices in that august
chamber in denunciation
of "the soulless fleets"—
i.e., the growth of Yan-
kee registration under for-
eign flags. Viscount Si-
mon, formerly president
of the British Chamber of
Shipping, actually pro-
posed the formation of a
"club" to eliminate the
competition of what he
called "bogus" flags.
If successful, such a
"club" would squeeze
American companies en-
gaged in building and
chartering such ships. The
effect would be to raise
freight rates to prohibitive
heights and thus put the
burden on American con-
sumers. Mr. Ropner has,
in fact, gone so far as to
declare these "flags of
necessity"—which he calls
"flags of convenience"—to
be "Public Enemy No. 1."
★
The Norwegian Ship-
owners' Association,
which is said to maintain
a considerable influence in
the United States, is
equally hostile to shipping
under these "flags of
necessity."
And now comes the In-
ternational Transport
Workers Federation, call-
ing for a boycott of ships
under these flags, with the
expectation of co-opera-
tion from the U.S. ship-
yard workers, the mari-
time unions and the Team-
sters.
The reason why the op-
position to the "flags of
necessity" has become so
intense is that movement
of cargo has seriously fall-
en off in the past year. A
large number of dry-cargo
ships, estimated at 6,000,-
000 deadweight tons, are
laid up in idleness over the
world. Tanker tonnage,
entering the market at the
danger of a permanent
closing of the Suez Canal,
outran the need. By early
this year 700,000 dead-
weight tons of Norwegian
shipping alone was report-
ed laid up. Some tankers
are carrying grain instead
of oil. In short, the mar-
ket is wide open.
