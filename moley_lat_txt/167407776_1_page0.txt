RAYMOND MOLEY:
Low Interest Rates
Upset Budget Equity
In his budget message
the President has again
recommended that the in-
terest rates charged by the
Treasury to a number of
government agencies be
made "more adequate."
This means that the sub-
sidies involved in this
process of borrowing at
low interest be reduced.
Among the agencies thus
enjoying government
bounty is the Rural Elec-
trification Administration,
which in turn lends the
money to co-operatives.
The President adds the
obvious truth that this
would "reduce government
expenditures significantly."
This is not the first
time that the President has
urged this step. Up to now,
the people benefited by
these bounties have pre-
vented action by Congress.
The Rural Electrifica-
tion Administration was
established to enable farm-
ers in thinly populated
areas to have the advan-
tage of electricity—an ad-
vantage which private
companies could not afford
to supply.
The working out of the
plan involved the creation
of farmers' co-operatives,
which built the transmis-
sion lines, obtained the
power—for the most part
from private companies—
and sold it to their farmer
members.
In the course of years,
the need of such remote
farmers has very largely
been supplied. And mean-
while many of these co-
operatives have waxed
larger and larger.
They have become sizable
business capable of giving
private companies stiff
competition because of the
advantage they have of
getting money cheaper
than private companies.
More recently, with
their market diminishing
among needy farmers,
they have moved into
more densely populated
areas where service is al-
ready being provided by
private companies.
When it is considered
that the census shows the
greatest growth in popula-
tion is in non-farming but
non-urban areas, this is a
rich market indeed.
This group of co-opera-
tives—loosely joined, so
far as lobbying and propa-
ganda are concerned, in
the National Rural Elec-
tric Co-operative Associa-
tion—has become a great
force for public, subsidized
power.
It moves into battles
over public power projects,
such as that which cen-
tered upon Hell's Canyon.
Thus, there has been created
with government sub-
sidies an agency which
presses far beyond the in-
terests of the remote farm-
ers whose need originated
it, toward more and more
government in business.

Charles B. Shuman,
president of the American
Farm Bureau Federation,
asked last year in a speech
to an association of co-op-
eratives "whether the
concern of many of the
rabid proponents of fed-
eral power is in the inter-
ests of the co-operatives or
are they more interested
in promoting a socialistic
federal power program?"
This sort of partial social-
ism, he pointed out, would
be a grave threat to the
co-operatives themselves.
The NRECA, supported
by co-operatives which in
turn are supported by the
generosity of American
taxpayers, is a formidable
lobbying and propaganda
agency.
It has its own building
in Washington, a large
staff and pours out tons
of "literature" supporting
its subsidized interests. Its
head, Clyde T. Ellis, is a
vehement agitator who
even goes so far as this,
excerpt from a pamphlet
under his name indicates:
*
"The power monopoly's
battle plan—its master
plan to destroy the rural
electrification and federal
wholesale power programs
... is, of course, master-
minded in Wall Street by
the investor-speculator
groups ... use public of-
ficials such as the Comp-
troller General, the Secre-
taries of Agriculture and
Interior ... and even the
President himself to carry
out their master plan."
This sort of vituperation,
it should be noted, is be-
cause the President, as the
trustee of the public inter-
est, merely demands that
perfectly solvent and even
prosperous co-operatives
pay something nearer the
rate which the govern-
ment must pay in the mar-
ket for the money it bor-
rows.
