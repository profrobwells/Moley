RAYMOND MOLEY:
Princeton Exercise
in Political Thought
A professor of American
history in Princeton Uni-
versity, as an exercise for
his class last term, set up
a miniature constitutional
convention. The conven-
tion itself was composed
of 15 students, and ratifica-
tion was by the 371 mem-
bers of the class.
The 15 draftsmen held
meetings over a period of
six weeks in the homes of
the eight instructors in the
course. One wonders what
might have happened in
1787 if the gentlemen who
wrote the Constitution of
the United States had
been benefited by the
benign ministrations of
current teachers in that
university.
*
For the "new" Prince-
ton constitution follows a
philosophy which violates
almost every precept held
by the founding fathers
and makes proposals
which even at that far-re-
moved date were regarded
as already proven to be in-
struments of tyranny, ei-
ther by a dictator or by a
tyrannous popular major-
ity.
The general import of
the students' views is that
the federal government
should be stronger, the
powers of the states
should be further reduced,
and the President should
have more power and Con-
gress less.
*
Over all is a proposal
that the Electoral College
should be abolished and
that the new and more
powerful President should
be elected by popular vote.
Thus we should be gov-
erned by a system which
would virtually obliterate
the small states and the
shrinking nonurban popu-
lation, and which would
put the final decision in a
close election in the re-
turns from the last ice-
bound igloos.
James Madison, our
fourth President and by
all odds the most influen-
tial of the gentlemen who
created our Constitution,
would have been interest-
ed in this revision of his
ideas. But before he re-
flected upon the nature of
this revision, he would
need to know that these
radical views of the stu-
dents pretty much follow
a substantial part of the
teaching they have been
receiving.
Not long ago I examined
a book of readings with
professorial annotations
prescribed for beginning
students in government at
Princeton. The general im-
port of this indoctrination
might well have satisfied
the requirements of a
training course for the
British Socialist Party.
Not that I should ob-
ject to exposing students
to all points of view. I did
that myself as a professor.
But the entire matter in
this case was indoctrina-
tion and apparently, judg-
ing from the "new"
Princetonian constitution,
it has worked well.
But in this indoctrina-
tion a principle is violated
which was observed in the
days when James Madison
of Virginia studied in
what was then the College
of New Jersey. John With-
erspoon, president of the
college and major mentor
of Madison, required his
students to read the great
classics—most of which
are known to the modern
student only by name. He
indoctrinated his students
in one principle—that a
student should never
blindly accept the views
of a teacher.
*
The Federalist says that
the mode of "appointing"
the President of the Unit-
ed States proposed in the
Constitution was "almost
the only part of the sys-
tem . . . which has es-
caped without severe cen-
sure," It is true that Ham-
ilton, not Madison, wrote
that number of the Fed-
eralist. But not only the
joint authorship of the
Federalist, but the evi-
dence in Madison's other
writings, makes clear that
anything like sheer popu-
lar election was regarded
as a peril to liberty and
the rights of minorities.
We need not take this on
authority, however ven-
erable, to realize what
would happen in electing
a President with greatly
enlarged power by popu-
lar vote.

A school notebook writ-
ten by Madison at the age
of 15, entitled "James
Madison His Book of Log-
ick," has been long exhibit-
ed under a glass case in the
exhibition hall of the Li-
brary of Congress. The
boy wrote, among many
other observations, that
"the distinction between
natural and artificial log-
ick" suggests the differ-
ence between "a piece of
ground disposed and cul-
tivated by a careful plant-
er" and "the same sort of
ground left uncultivated
in the state of nature."
Thus it all depends upon
which professor does the
cultivating.
