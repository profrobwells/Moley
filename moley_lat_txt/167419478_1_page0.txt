RAYMOND MOLEY:
Los Angeles Points
Way for Republicans
As the Republican Na-
tional Committee meets in
Des Moines this week, its
first order of business will
be the strengthening of
party organizations over
the country.
When it gets down to
this business, a plan
which has been developed
for Los Angeles County
might well be used as a
model for every other big
industrial center. For it is
in those industrial centers
that the Republican Party
must be revived if it is to
survive.
In order to explain this
plan, it is necessary to
point out, first, that despite
the Republican disaster in
the state of California, the
GOP did not do so badly in
Los Angeles County. In
the 85th Congress eight of
the 12 Congressional dis-
tricts in the county had
Republican representa-
tives. In the election only
one of these was lost, and
that was not too decisive.
This result was not a
matter of chance. For sev-
eral years Los Angeles has
really had two organiza-
tions on the Republican
sideâ€”the legally constitu-
ted Republican organiza-
tion with its governing
committees, and also a pri-
vately organized group,
largely composed of busi-
ness and professional men
and women, called the Re-
publican Associates.
The latter has an ele-
ment of permanence. It
has been operating for sev-
eral years. It has its own
organization for recruiting
and training volunteers in
the precincts and also a re-
search setup to prepare
and publish material for
the guidance of volunteer
workers and voters.
The Republican Associ-
ates works closely with
the legally constituted Re-
publican county commit-
tee. It has carefully avoid-
ed the danger, always in-
herent in private groups,
of antagonizing the elected
party officials by seeming
to take away prestige and
money from the "regu-
lars," a course which ends
in failure all around.
What it does is to put
muscle into the party cam-
paigns by providing
trained volunteer help for
candidates, which results
in that indispensable ele-
ment in party success:
votes.
And now through the
Republican Associates
there has evolved a plan
for action looking toward
1960 and beyond. It is
largely the work of Homer
M. Preston, a member not
only of the Republican
Party but of the associates.
It is based upon three
principles: To raise and
spend money to build a
permanent, efficient party
organization, to decentral-
ize organization and activ-
ity into the 12 Congres-
sional districts in the
county, to see that there
is close liaison between
the party and leaders in
the business community.
Fundamental in the
plan would be the employ-
ment of full-time, year-
around professional man-
agers: an executive for
the entire county, a Con-
gressional district direc-
tor for each of the coun-
ty's districts, a full-time fi-
nance director, full-time,
paid precinct directors,
and a public relations di-
rector.
In all cases these profes-
sional directors would
work with the part-time
elected county chairman
and other members of the
regular organization, down
to the precinct captains
and the "block lieuten-
ants."
It is important to note
that Mr. Preston estimates
that the entire annual cost
of such an organization
would be no more than
$300,000. This is not an
excessive amount for so
immense a metropolitan
community. In fact, in
most campaigns much
more is spent in such a
large district and much of
it is wasted.
If the Republican Na-
tional Committee really
wants to do something
about bringing out the
votes necessary to victory,
it should encourage some-
thing like this every-
where. But I use the word
"encourage" advisedly.
For it cannot impose its
will upon the local organ-
izations, nor has it the
money for any such setup
nationally.
