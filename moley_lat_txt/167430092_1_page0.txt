Private Power Companies Move
Forward on Nuclear Projects

BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Behind the bitter per-
sonal vendetta against
Lewis Strauss, headed by
Sen. Clinton Anderson, is
the broader attack against
private power companies
for alleged lag in develop-
ing atomic power for
peace. For those who fa-
vor a government monop-
oly, that provides an argu-
ment for the investment
of billions of dollars of
taxpayers' money in big
nuclear plants. This charge
has been so persistently
pressed that many have
accepted it as the truth
without taking the trouble
to look at the facts.

Elmer L. Lindseth,
chairman of the Edison
Electric Institute's com-
mittee on atomic power
and president of the Cleve-
land Electric Illuminating
Co., presents a number of
solid facts in defense of
the companies:
"Investor-owned electric
companies currently are
involved in 15 projects
which are in operation,
under construction or in
various stages of design
and planning.
"These projects involve
ultimate expenditures of
more than $540 million. In
addition, there are 11 re-
search, development and
study projects under way.
"Participating in these
26 projects are 131 electric
companies, which had in-
vested $130 million in
atomic power programs by
the end of 1958."
These facts are beyond
argument, as information
I have taken from other
sources proves.
For example, the offi-
cials of the Commonwealth
Edison (Ill.) say that they are
constructing a great power plant at Dresden,
Ill., will participate in
lighting the homes in the
northern part of that state
by the mid-1960s at rea-
sonable prices.
However, under the
pressure of congressional
advocates of government
building on a large scale,
the Atomic Energy Com-
mission is considering the
construction of a huge
plutonium-producing plant
at Hanford, Wash., which
would include features for
developing power for com-
mercial use. The reactor
for this would cost some-
thing like $145 million,
with additional power-
generating features for an-
other $60 million. This
would generate from 300,-
000 to 600,000 kilowatts.
The AEC, however, has
not approved this plan to
add the electric gener-
ating features, nor has
Congress given an authori-
zation. With ever-mount-
ing deficits it is hardly
justifiable to add this sum
to the budget, considering
the programs of the pri-
vate companies.
Mr. Lindseth adds that
certain fundamentals
should be kept in mind in
bringing atomic power to
the peaceful uses of the
public. These are the in-
centives in any private in-
dustry to keep down costs
and develop more efficien-
cy, incentives never pres-
ent in a government mo-
nopoly.

He adds: "These basic
fundamentals have be-
come obscured because of
the birth and early devel-
opment of nuclear power
in a cloud of secrecy and
government monopoly.
"This beginning, how-
ever, should not dictate its
ultimate development.
"There is nothing spe-
cial about nuclear power
that requires its future de-
velopment outside the
framework of our free en-
terprise-type of business
system.
"The sooner the basic
fundamentals are recog-
nized, the sooner the na-
tion will reach the objec-
tives it has set for itself."
