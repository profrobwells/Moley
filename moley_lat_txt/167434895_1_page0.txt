Federal Interstate Highway Plan
Is in Trouble on Taxes, Inflation

The federal interstate
highway program passed
in 1956 by Congress con-
templated the greatest
public works undertaking
in human history. After
nearly three of a planned
13 years of progress, the
operation is faced with
various financial troubles
and a drastic slowdown.

Raising taxes on gaso-
line and oil and tires will
not solve the trouble. For
that remedy might well
mean diminishing returns.
In all tax systems there is
a point at which tax rates
will automatically cut con-
sumption and production
and result in lower reve-
nues.

The highway concept
dates back many genera-
tions to the time when
Henry Clay envisioned a
"chain of turnpike roads
and canals from Passama-
quoddy Bay to New Or-
leans... to facilitate inter-
course between all parts
of the country and to bind
and connect us together."

In our time, federal
highway aid began in 1916,
but not until 1932 was a
federal tax imposed on
gasoline. This, however,
was not earmarked for
roads and highways.

The 1956 act assessed
the entire cost of the great
highway program against
highway users. The tradi-
tional 50-50 federal-state
ratio of cost was aban-
doned and 90% was to be
paid by the federal govern-
ment on highways, with
roads remaining on the
50-50 basis.

The cost was estimated
at $27.6 billion for 13 years
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
of construction, with fi-
nancing for 16 years. Into
the highway trust fund
were to be paid the 3-cent-
per-gallon tax on gasoline;
half the 10% tax on trucks;
a tax on tires, tubes and
retread rubber; and a use
tax on heavy trucks and
busses.

But the highway trust
fund was not to receive
the 10% tax proceeds on
new automobiles and the
8% net tax on parts and
accessories. These reve-
nues go to the general pur-
poses of the federal gov-
ernment.

Meanwhile, inflation,
faulty estimates and new,
unforeseen expenses have
appeared. The states,
which furnish the esti-
mates, now calculate that
the project will cost $40
billion instead of the $27.6
billion. And so the fund is
in trouble.

President Eisenhower
proposed in his budget
message an increase in the
federal gasoline tax from
the present 3 to 4½ cents.
This has met with deter-
mined resistance.

★

Opponents of this in-
crease point out that the
national average of federal
and state gasoline taxes
amounts to 9 cents, which
is 41% of the cost to the
consumer. States oppose
this further dig into what
they consider their source
of revenue for their own
highway and road needs.

Moreover, several states
are already raising their
own rates. To increase the
federal rate 1½ cents, to-
gether with the raises in
the states this year, would
put the tax burden on this
essential fuel, on an av-
erage, at more than 50% of
the price.

Congress might, as it has
with other items, appro-
priate borrowed money and
thus increase the federal
deficit and give inflation
another stimulating shot.
The same thing would be
the result if the trust fund
were permitted to borrow
the money or the financ-
ing period could be in-
creased from its present
planned 16 years to more
than 20 years, thus put-
ting the burden on the
current teen-agers, who
will be footing the bills by
that time.

★

A more equitable solu-
tion would be to provide
that all the taxes now lev-
ied on the motor vehicle
owner, such as the excise
tax on new vehicles, and
all taxes now collected
on trucks and busses and
oil be assigned to the
highway program. This
would provide an addition-
al $1.3 billion for fiscal
1960.

The prudent thing, then,
would be for Congress to
decide which is more im-
portant-new housing for
people who could pay their
own rentals in privately
constructed houses; big,
gorgeous city improve-
ments (urban renewal)
and other items that might
better be deferred, or high-
ways.

But who expects Con-
gress to be prudent these
days?
