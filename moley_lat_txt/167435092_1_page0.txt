Revolt against tyranny
takes two forms: Open, vi-
olent demonstrations with
rioting, bloodshed and ra-
pine, or silent, secret sabo-
tage, law violation and
other forms of frustrating
an authority which the
public considers oppres-
sive and unjust.
Usually the second sort
of activity runs into the
first. But in what I am con-
sidering, the second may
run not into bullets but
ballots.
A friend of mine, who is
a distinguished tax and es-
tate lawyer, drew on the
back of a menu card a
rough chart. One line
moved from left to right
in an ascending curve.
"This," he said, "repre-
sents the rise in taxes
which we are experienc-
ing."
(He is a New Yorker,
and the subject that
touched off his exposition
was Gov. Rockefeller's
high tax budget.)
Then he drew another
line, curving downward:
"This is the state of pub-
lic morality. The higher
the taxes, the greater the
amount of cheating."
He continued: "At first
the tax increases do not
seriously impair public
morals, but, as the pres-
sure of increasing taxes
intensifies, the drop in
morality accelerates, at
first gradually and finally
catastrophically."
He is a lawyer whose
knowledge of the habits of
the well-to-do comes from
his many clients. His com-
ments come with author-
ity:
"I don't mean that the
rich come to cheat more
than the less fortunate.
The rich, after all, can hire
clever tax planners who,
whatever the Internal
Revenue Code may at-
tempt in the way of re-
strictions, can always de-
sign interesting and prof-
itable ways legally to es-
cape taxes.
"But to the relatively
poor such expert aid is not
available. They fashion do-
it-yourself methods of
cheating. These are called
evasion, which is illegalâ€”
not avoidance, which is le-
gal. But by either method,
the motive is the same and
the end result is the same.
"Where are we today?
Everybody cheats who is
able to. Few of the well-to-
do resort to such extreme
methods as hiding income
abroad. But they exagger-
ate deductions, carrying
family expenses as busi-
ness expenses or other-
wise. Businessmen use
such methods as inventory
manipulations. But the
time may come when there
will be more and more hid-
ing of income, which is
very easy to do.
"People with low in-
comes have already start-
ed to hide on a widespread
scale. Certain kinds of do-
mestic help are impossible
to get unless payment is
made in cash. Many an
otherwise virtuous house-
wife participates in this
avenue to evasion. Many
employees have cash-on-
the-spot jobs on the side.
Some people with relative-
ly low incomes make no
returns and get away with
it."
I might add that a year
or two ago a lawyer in a
rural area whose clients
are farmers told me that
he lost many clients be-
cause he prepared for
them what he considered
honest returns. Thereup-
on, the clients marched
over to another lawyer
whose morality rested on
another plane.
Thus, there is an ele-
ment of competition in
which the lawyer whose
compassion for the taxpay-
er exceeds his concern for
public revenue gets the
most business.
As this goes on, the tax
collectors must hire more
and more agents to ferret
out cheating. That, in
turn, means more bureauc-
racy, more government ex-
pense and more taxes.
My friend concluded:
"We are close to the point
where cheating will be
greater and more aggres-
sive. Finally, when there
is a breakdown in one area
of morality, it is likely to
metastasize into other
areas, in the way a cancer-
ous condition spreads."
