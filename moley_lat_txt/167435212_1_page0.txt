Federal Urban Renewal 'Liberals'
Offer Windfalls to Wealthy Few
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a number of pieces I
have shown that the "lib-
eral" philosophy, now so
powerful in Congress, in
practice is a burden on the
taxpayer and in many
cases a windfall to the
wealthy. The pose of the
"liberal" about being the
friend of the "little fel-
low" is gross hypocrisy.
Let us look at, another ex-
ample.
The multi-billion-dollar
federal aid program for
"urban renewal," for
which a bill is pending in
Congress for a fresh in-
stallment of $2 billion for
the next few years, is a
rich mine of profit for a
few at the expense of the
vast majority of taxpayers.

What happens is this:
The Federal Urban
Renewal Administration
lends money to the local
urban renewal authorities
to draw up plans for a big
project. Then, after fed-
eral approval, the local au-
thority, under eminent do-
main, condemns and ac-
quires the land, homes and
places of business in the
area. The buildings are
demolished and the neces-
sary public utilities are
installed, including streets,
water, mains and sewers.
Then the land thus
cleared and improved is
sold to private people and
companies financially able
to proceed with the devel-
opment. The Federal Ur-
ban Renewal Administra-
tion advances cash grants
covering two-thirds of the
cost.
The point is that when
the land is thus resold it
is at a big loss. under the
cost of condemnation. Ob-
viously, the cherished "lit-
tle man" is not buying
such property even at a
knock-down bargain. Only
those with large financial
means can get it.
Some of the figures in-
volved in this bargain sell-
ing are astounding. In one
city the land and old build-
ing were acquired at a
cost of $82 million and re-
sold for $25 million; in an-
other case, the figures
were $4 million and $850,-
000 respectively, and so
on.

The excuse for this sort
of profit to private persons
and companies is that
without such federal
windfalls the job would
not be done. No private
builder or corporation
would undertake such a
development in the mid-
dle of a city when he
could more profitably op-
erate elsewhere. And
even if he were rich
enough to attempt it, he
would have plenty of trou-
ble acquiring the property
without the power to con-
demn it.
The very able and
sound young Republican
congressman from Dallas,
Bruce Alger,. has been
saying some plain things
about this legalized ex-
ploitation of the smaller
taxpayers. In a speech in
the House he said:
"I want to make it plain
I am for urban renewal. I
do not know anyone who
is against urban renewal,
the improvement of
homes and neighborhoods,
the removal of blight,
slum clearance, and the
rest... Many cities are
now engaged in slum
clearance and rehabilita-
tion through local private
and public initiative, with-
out federal aid.
"What about the cost to
the taxpayer of urban re-
newal? It is almost be-
yond the imagination to
comprehend.
"The write-down or
shrinkage of value which
occasions the federal loan
and grant is subject to se-
rious question in itself.
Why the excessive drop
in value when raw land,
strategically, located, is
cleared and ready for use?
"Generally, the availa-
bility for a higher use
should enhance the land
values sufficiently to off-
set the cost. At the least,
an appreciable write-down
suggests some question of
judgment on the part of
the urban renewal author-
ity's setting a re-use value
not in conformity with the
highest and best use of
the land. Misuse of land is
always reflected, in lower
value.
*
"Another financial dan-
ger is the windfall, the
heavy profit which might
be made by individuals in
the private development
after purchase of the
land."
An interesting benefit
that has attended the
great loss of conservative
strength in Congress is
that a few members stand
out in the minority more
clearly than ever before.
Alger is one of these. His
ability is not to be ques-
tioned, and his business
experience has been such
as to make his opinion on
this subject respected and
important.
Again, I suggest that if
the Republican Party
wants to shed the "big
business, rich men" tag, it
might well, like Alger,
tear the mask off these
"friends of the little man"
among the "liberals."
