RAYMOND MOLEY:
Conservatives Face
Challenge of Times
As the new year begins,
just before big news and
public problems explode
all over the place, it may
be worth while to consider
some fundamentals. The
following reflections are
inspired by thinking about
the plight of conserva-
tives, especially those in
the Republican Party.
The failure of some
American conservatives,
as shown in the election
returns, is suggested by a
motto which I saw oyer
the fireplace in an inn at
Stowe, Vt.: "Ve get too
soon old, and too late
schmardt." I am not now
repeating the old charge
that they want to "go
back to McKinley," for the
economic world of 1900 is
as far away from us now
as that of the Ming dy-
nasty. Nor the outworn
saw that they would "go
back to Hoover," because
in fact Herbert Hoover
was extraordinarily liber-
al in his economic ideas.
*
So let's not talk about
"going back" to anything
except the basic constitu-
tional guarantees of
American liberty. The
thing that concerns me
about some conservatives
is their preoccupation
with denouncing the liber-
al Democrats and modern
Republicans by name-
calling, or their reliance
on easy solutions to the
specific social and econom-
ic problems that have been
and will be confronting
Congress. Among these
is a return to the gold
standard, or merely bal-
ancing the budget, or halt-
ing all foreign aid, or
breaking all relations with
Soviet Russia.
All these might be ulti-
mate objectives, but to in-
sist upon one or all is not
a tenable political plat-
form or anything but a
means of immediately up-
setting the economic ap-
plecart.
*
The conservatives who,
I believe, cannot share
their extreme position are
mostly businessmen who
have themselves come up
the hard way, many pro-
fessional men and women
of the same cast of mind,
and millions in the mid-
dle-income groups. A pas-
sage in one of Matthew
Arnold's essays published
exactly 90 years ago is im-
mediately pertinent. He
referred to an aristocraty
newly arisen in England
which was challenging the
old land-owning, titled no-
bility. These, he said,.
owed their pre-eminence:
to "stanch individualism
... to that passion for do-
ing what one likes, for the
assertion of personal lib-
erty."
*
They possessed, he add-
ed, all of the fundamental
tastes and habits of the
workers, including the
love of freedom of choice
which is the innate urge
of every normal person.
Instead of winning the
workers to their side, how-
ever, that aristocracy per-
mitted Gladstonian lib-
eralism to take over for a
generation. And the re-
forms of that liberalism
consisted in doing more
and for, and not with the
workers. The liberal was
a patron, not a compatriot
of the worker.
It is so with the so-called
intellectuals and labor
bosses here and now who
dominate the liberal group
and, with it, the Demo-
cratic Party. The great
gap in their armor is their
reliance upon paternalism
by and with the govern-
ment. I have just read a
book by a modern liberal
economist, and there isn't
a word about the individ-
ual and his freedom of
choice. These people are
neither liberal in a true
sense, nor democratic.
They are the elite, the
"we" who would do some-
thing for the people whose
instincts and preferences
they neither know nor re-
spect.
â˜…
The course of true con-
servatism is to revive the
spirit of individualism in
all. All government poli-
cies, like that advocated
by the Farm Bureau Fed-
eration for the farmers,
should be aimed at moving
toward self-help and self-
reliance. There must be
some intervention of gov-
ernment, but always
aimed at its own extinc-
tion by creating the condi-
tions by which people can
provide for their own se-
curity and happiness.
Those conditions require
reasonable protection,
never paternalism. The
goal of real conservatives
must be to stress the very
qualities which they them-
selves possess.
