TOKYO â€” Judge Akio
Date of the Tokyo District
Court has handed down
a decision which has
thrown some embarrass-
ment in the way of Ja-
pan's Liberal-Democratic
government and has given
the opposition Socialists
plenty to talk about. The
government will immedi-
ately appeal the case to
the Japanese Supreme
Court and, if possible, get
the decision revers:
*
Americans will recog-
nize in the issue the same
problems which were un-
der discussion when the
Bricker Amendment was
debated in the United
States more than five
years ago. Under the Japa-
nese constitution, in which
the influence of the U.S.
is strongly marked, Japan
has renounced maintain-
ing any war potential ex-
cept in self-defense. The
judge maintained that this
implies forbidding Amer-
ican troops to be stationed
here.
Note that the decision
is based upon an implica-
tion that the presence of
our troops conveys the
danger of carrying Japan
into a war. But by the U.S.-
Japan security treaty,
our troops are permitted
to remain. Thus an inter-
pretation of the constitu-
tion runs squarely into a
treaty obligation.
The rule in the U.S.,
which the Bricker Amend-
ment was intended to mod-
ify, provides that a treaty
obligation supersedes our
Constitution.

Perhaps we are caught
here in something of our
own making. In our anx-
iety to prevent the rise of
militarism in Japan, this
renunciation of war was
imposed upon a great in-
dustrial nation closely
hemmed in on its west by
two potentially hostile
powers, Red China and So-
viet Russia.
We thus assumed the
job of protecting Japan
against those powers. To
do so, Japan must be used
as a base and a place for
supplying our armed
forces. Until this decision,
the governing party of
Japan has accepted this
status. It still intends to
maintain it in its appeal.
The government will
argue on several points.
It will maintain that the
vague wording of the con-
stitution still permits self-
defense and that the
treaty is designed to pro-
vide that through the mili-
tary power of the U.S. It
also will argue that "war
potential" applies to Japa-
nese military forces and
not to American forces.
Moreover, it will follow
American precedent and
say that the courts have
the power to interpret the
constitution but cannot
make judgments on trea-
ties.
The ruling assumes
more importance because
the decision of the su-
preme court will be made
in the midst of an elec-
tion season. A hot cam-
paign is already under
way between conservative
and Socialist candidates
for the very important
post of mayor of Tokyo.
An election is also coming
in which half of the upper
house of the Diet is to be
up for election.
The political situation is
more acute because of the
influence of some Commu-
nists in politics and the
anti-American sentiment
in a fraction of the Social-
ist Party. If trouble comes
in American-Japanese re-
lations, political party com-
plications will be the ma-
jor cause. Fortunately, the
temper of the nation is
strongly favorable to the
U.S.
