Japan Affirms U.S. Friendship
as Conservatives Win Election
When I arrived in Ja-
pan in March, some Amer-
ican "liberals" over there
told me with extraordinary
assurance that Prime Min-
ister Kishi's Liberal-Demo-
cratic Party was in a de-
cline and that any day the
present cabinet would fall.
These "liberals" eagerly
introduced me to Socialist
leaders and left-wing econ-
omists for confirmation of
their wishful thinking. Un-
derneath it all was the sug-
gestion, subtly conveyed,
that the Japanese were
yearning for trade with
Red China and that if we
recognized that regime un-
der the sort of promises
freely given by such out-
fits Japan would go along,
too, and all would be well
-or better. Neutralism
was in the air-that is,
their air.

I have been no stranger
to such wiles. In England,
before the election in 1950,
the same sort assured me
that the Socialist govern-
ment of Attlee would be
returned with more than
a hundred majority in the
House of Commons. "Lib-
cral" propaganda is the
same everywhere. The
"majority" proved to be
two. It is wise to wait un-
til the votes are counted.
However, as I talked
with Socialist leaders in
Japan in the days that fol-
lowed my arrival, it be-
came increasingly appar-
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
ent that there is no real
Socialist Party. There are
only Socialists of all sorts
and shapes of ideology.
There was no responsible
party at all. And Japan,
enjoying the fruits of a
prosperity based upon es-
sentially capitalistic insti-
tutions, was yearning for
no change.
Kishi did not fall, and in
the April elections of may-
ors and governors in the
prefectures conservative
Liberal-Democrats won all
along the line. This was
especially true in Tokyo,
the vital center of the na-
tion.
And now, in June, in
the election of one-half of
the upper house of the na-
tional Diet, the House of
Councilors, all that the
"liberals" and neutralists
were saying in March is
refuted. Kishi's party not
only held its present con-
trol of the House of Coun-
citors but lifted its major-
ity by five seats to 132 in
a total of 250.

In the nation-wide race
for the seats elected at
large, the Liberal-Demo-
crats polled more than 12
million votes; the Social-
ists, 7.7 million. Com-
pared with the vote three
years ago, this was a con-
siderable gain for the con-
servatives and a loss for
the Socialists. The small
Communist percentage of
2.1 dropped to 1.9.
Considering the firm
friendship for the United
States constantly empha-
sized by the Kishi govern-
ment, this is a clear gain
in U.S.-Japan relations. It
is a repudiation of neu-
tralization and a rebuff to
those who have been ad-
vocating the recognition
of Red China. It certainly
should be a warning to
those American "liberals"
who would repudiate our
international obligations
under the United Nations
and to Nationalist China
by recognizing the Chi-
nese Communists.

Under the Liberal-Dem-
ocratic regime there has
been encouragement to
the growth and strength-
ening of free enterprise.
The tangible evidences of
the fruits of this sort of
economic liberty are pres-
ent in more for all-elec-
tric power, excellent rail-
way and bus service, more
leisure time and reason-
able social services by the
government.
With an understanding
of trade problems by us,
and more and more eco-
nomic and cultural inter-
course, with material capi-
tal investment over there
by American industry, we
may count for an indefinite
time upon Japan as our
strongest ally in the Far
East.
