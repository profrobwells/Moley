Conservatives View Forthcoming
British Election With Confidence
The signs in Britain all
point to a general election
in. October. Under their
system an election may be
called whenever the cabi-
net in power calls for it,
and that usually is a deci-
sion of the prime minis-
ter. The only condition is
that it must be within
five years of the preced-
ing election. That one was
held in May, 1955.
In 1945, because of the
end of the war in Europe
and the end of wartime
unity between the parties,
Churchill was almost com-
pelled to have the polling
in July and suffered a
trouncing. In 1950, with
the five-year limit ap-
proaching and his party
in trouble, Attlee decided
on February.
In 1951, the Labor Par-
ty was in greater trouble
and, with its slim majori-
ty vanishing, October was
the month.. In 1955,
Churchill resigned, and it
seemed imperative for his
successor, Sir Anthony
Eden, to go to the coun-
try in May.
It seems to most Con-
servatives that an election
this October would be
wonderful for them. The
decision will, however, not
be made public by Prime
Minister Harold Macmil-
lan until September. Brit-
ish political strategy re-
quires that the opposition
be given the least possi-
ble time to get ready.
The anxiety of the Brit-
ish government for a sum-
mit conference is prompt-
ed by the approaching
election. Such a confer-
ence, with the prime min-
ister playing a major role,
would be most popular.
In 1955 the agreement of
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Eisenhower, to
have such a conference
won a lot of votes for the
Conservatives.
Economic conditions de-
cidedly favor the Conserv-
atives. Unemployment is
at an unusually low point
and is falling. Production
is high. And a strong
statement of Conservative
principles has been pre-
pared for the campaign by
Home Secretary R. A.
Butler. Generally, except
in the Suez affair, Mac-
millan has been a strong
and popular prime minis-
ter..

Meanwhile, there is no
peace in the Labor Party
household. The question
of doing something about
nuclear tests and warfare
has been a bone of con-
tention for a long time.
At first, the argument
was between the leader,
Hugh Gaitskell, and Aneu-
rin Bevan. Finally, a truce
was declared between
them, but the trouble has
now been renewed by
Frank Cousins, general
secretary of the Transport
and General Workers
Union, a powerful figure
on the British scene, and
his sympathizers among
labor members of Parlia-
ment.
The Cousins faction fa-
vors unilateral action by
Britain in renouncing the
use of the hydrogen
bomb. On July 11, Gait-
skell, in a well-considered
speech to a party rally,
hurled a direct challenge
at the Cousins notion. He
said that it was "escapist,
myopic, and a peril to
peace."
As far as Cousins was
concerned, the Socialist
leader said that no "one
man could dictate party
decisions." If the Cousins
idea were adopted, he
added, it would mean the
end of British participa-
tion in NATO.
Gaitskell favors a "non-
nuclear club" of nations.
This, of course, is what
everyone wants, including
the Conservatives, provid-
ed the nations vitally con-
cerned are willing to join
—a very remote prospect.
Gaitskell has been criti-
cized by his party mem-
bers for shedding most of
his socialist ideas. Indeed,
he is quite unwilling to
sponsor further experi-
ments in the nationaliza-
tion of industries — a
touchy subject which,
when it was tried under
Attlee, was neither suc-
cessful nor popular.
The fact is that there is
hardly any clear issue
upon which the Labor
Party can offer a positive
stand in an election.
★
Organization in the local
areas and constituencies is
vital in a British election.
Here, too, the Labor Par-
ty is in trouble. Much of
its money must come
from the trade unions,
and some of them are not
overly enthusiastic about
the extreme ideas of the
radical people in the par-
ty.
While the local organi-
zations of the Labor Par-
ty have been growing
weaker since their victory
in 1945, the Conservatives
have been building up
theirs.
Barring unforeseen
events, it would seem that
the Conservative Party
has never approached an
election with better pros-
pects.
