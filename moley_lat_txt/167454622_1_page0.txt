Socialist Labor Leaders: a Threat
to Union Members and the Nation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It should be apparent
to anyone who followed
the first world war that
national socialism and
fascism, as well as com-
munism, are deadly ene-
mies of a free labor move-
ment. When the power of
government is developed
to its logical end, private
ownership, management,
and organized labor must
be swallowed up. Collec-
tive bargaining must nec-
essarily involve two par-
ties, with freedom of action
and relatively equal capac-
ity to exert power in be-
half of their interests.
★
Consequently, a labor
leader who is also ideologi-
cally a socialist is attempt-
ing to reconcile the ir-
reconcilable. Take Walter
Reuther as an example.
There can be no doubt
that he is a socialist in his
ultimate objectives. These
objectives are also politi-
cal in the sense that he
uses the great power of his
union to elect and direct
public officials. His idea
of preserving the benefits
attained by his union
members is to control the
government. In all his
schemes, the ruling
authority would be repre-
sentative of three inter-
ests—labor, management,
and the public, or, to be
specific, government. But
he resolves his dilemma by
seeking to have labor con-
trol the third member,
government.
I might develop, if space
permitted, the perilous as-
sumption under which he
operates. For his grand de-
sign would require con-
tinuing, cohesive union
power mobilized to con-
trol the making and en-
forcement of law indefi-
nitely. The time might
come, however, despite the
incredible activities of
COPE, when a government
which is not to the Reu-
ther liking would provide
the decisive third party in
his plan. Then workers
who have been deluded by
his sophistry would find
themselves at the mercy
of government and man-
agement.
John L. Lewis has al-
ways opposed socialism.
His interest has been in
maintaining sufficient
health in the capitalist sys-
tem to afford his workers
more and more for their
efforts.
This issue is clearly
shown in the current split
in labor ranks over Sen.
O'Mahoney's bill S 215.
This would require a com-
pany contemplating a
price increase to notify the
Federal Trade Commis-
sion and submit to 30 days'
hearings before that body
for the purpose of show-
ing the necessity for in-
crease. This indirect
method of reaching virtu-
al price control is defend-
ed by Sens. O'Mahoney,
Kefauver and others as a
way of attacking what
they call "administered"
prices, which they claim
are monopolistic and one
of the causes of inflation
over the past few years.

The bill is, of course,
vigorously opposed by
manufacturers. But unex-
pected opposition has
come from some union
leaders themselves. Offi-
cially, the AFL-CIO has
asked that action be de-
ferred on the bill until
Sen. Douglas' Joint Eco-
nomic Committee has
made its report on the
economy as a whole. No
doubt George Meany is
opposed to such a plan but
wishes to avoid a clash
with Walter Reuther's
UAW, which is ardently
for it.
But David J. McDonald
of the steelworkers sees
clearly the implications of
such a measure of govern-
ment interference. He said
in his testimony:
"In the investigations of
proposed price increases
which the Federal Trade
Commission would be re-
quired to conduct, it would
undoubtedly be alleged
by the industry involved
that the proposed price in-
creases are necessitated
by wage increases. No
matter how lacking in mer-
it these allegations might
be, they nevertheless
would have to be dealt
with by the commission.

"At that juncture, the
entire labor contract
would be thrown in con-
troversy before the com-
mission. The impact on
collective bargaining and
industrial stability would
be disastrous... I strong-
ly urge this subcommittee
to consider this problem
before embarking on a
course which would make
the government an arbiter
or monitor in labor nego-
tiations in all basic indus-
tries."
In the course of an-
swers to questions, he said
further that he had been
in Australia and had seen
compulsory arbitration in
action. The workers there,
he said, had thought that
when they introduced this
socialistic measure "they
were getting something
great, but they found out
that they had made a mis-
take." The plan ended in
"complete government
control." Thus, he contin-
ued, the Federal Trade
Commission would, under
the O'Mahoney plan, be-
come a "labor court."
A court, I may add,
which McDonald realizes
would not always be on la-
bor's side.
