The New St. Lawrence River Dam:
Another Honor for Robert Moses
When the great hydro-
electric dam joining the
English-speaking common-
wealth across the St. Law-
rence was dedicated, the
smiling co-host to the
Queen and Vice-President
was Robert Moses, chair-
man of the New York Pow-
er Authority. The struc-
ture is appropriately
named the Moses-Saunders
Dam. This is one of the
many monuments to the
incredible drive and im-
agination of Moses. There
is the immense Jones
Beach Park on Long Is-
land, the vast Triborough
Bridge, underpasses and
overpasses in the metro-
politan area, the Coliseum
and other public build-
ings, dozens of smaller
parks and playgrounds,
and great housing projects.
At the present time
Moses holds a number of
public offices which would
stagger the imagination of
any observer and would
certainly exceed the ca-
pacity of any other pub-
lic official in the United
States except the Presi-
dent. His one paid post is
park commissioner of
New York City. He is also
chairman of the Tri-
borough Bridge and Tun-
nel Authority, the mayor's
committee on slum clear-
ance, and the New York
State Power Authority.
He is a member of the New
York City Planning Com-
mission and is also some-
thing called "construc-
tion co-ordinator." There
are probably other hats
which adorn the rack in
his private office, but I
have not checked the de-
tails recently.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Moses is a fine example
of the partially endowed
professional public serv-
ant. When he graduated
from Yale a half-century
ago, his father left him
with enough of a legacy to
keep the hunger wolf from
the door while the boy
fared forth to battle the
political wolves in the
world of public service.
Since then, he has served
importantly under Govs.
Smith, Roosevelt, Lehman,
Dewey, Harriman, and
Rockefeller. In the city he
has held office under May-
ors La Guardia, O'Dwyer,
Impellitteri, and Wagner.
Some of these political fig-
ures have not liked Moses,
but their prudence for-
bade any move to oust the
man who has come to be
regarded in New York
with the reverence accord-
ed only to Cardinal Spell-
man, Washington Irving,
and Casey Stengel.

Moses is not a quiet
worker. The newspapers
are constantly enlivened
with Moses' invectives
against anyone who rises
to differ with him. Such
benighted ilk are prompt-
ly belabored for what they
don't know but what
Moses knows, and also for
what they are, and have
been, and what they will
be in the future. His ca-
reer is a sort of civic rock
and roll, constantly mov-
ing into new areas of pub-
lic service while whaling
away at all opposition.
Perhaps other city
builders, such as Augustus
Caesar and Napoleon III,
were impelled to tell rath-
er than ask people what
they wanted. At any rate,
the Moses projects are
enforced with an indiffer-
ence to the desires of those
who are bounced about
which would befit any dic-
tator. As he moves into
the shadow of three-score
and ten, Moses seems pos-
sessed with even greater
energy, perhaps born of
an ambition to make over
New York City according
to the blueprint of his de-
sire.

This frenzied finale has
seemed at the moment to
blind him to the eternal
rule of history, that when-
ever there are big public
projects involving big pub-
lic money there will be
attracted a swarm of po-
litical operators and other
gentry seeking rich re-
turns for indifferent serv-
ices.
In the present difficul-
ties surrounding what is
called "slum clearance,"
the New York press has
revealed that in the mad
rush for partially federal-
ly financed public housing,
a deplorable injustice is
being meted out to solid
citizens who cling to their
own homes and who re-
sent being called "slum"
dwellers. Also, the opera-
tions by which people are
rooted out and relocated,
while great human bee-
hives are built, are in
many cases reeking with
political pull and large
remuneration. The Moses
answer to the revelations
is a bitter denunciation of
the press.
Perhaps what is needed
is a job of clearance on
slum clearance.
