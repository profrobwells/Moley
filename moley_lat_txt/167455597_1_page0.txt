KYOTO, Japan — After
eight days on my first
visit to Japan, the incredi-
ble energy of its people
hits me with terrific force.
Nothing in my experience
parallels it, except perhaps
my first visit long
ago, as a native of a quiet
country town, to Chicago.
From where I sit I look
out over a parking court-
yard that was ripped up
yesterday morning. It was
newly laid with concrete
by last evening. New York
taxis take you for a leis-
urely, reflective drive compared
with the mad speed
of the little vehicles here.
Harrowing is hardly adequate
to describe it. It is
terrifying.
Coming here to Kyoto,
the seven-hour train ride
takes you through the
vast stretch of Tokyo’s industrial
section. That city
is close to 8.5 million; Yokohama,
larger than
Cleveland; Nagoya, the
size of Detroit, and this,
the mere “cultural capital,”
as big as Baltimore.
A small distance south
of here is Osaka, a little
smaller than Los Angeles,
and also a half-dozen
cities rivaling Peoria. In
between the cities, miles
of meticulously neat
farms. Japan, by such
thrifty use of its scanty
space, raises 80% of its
food needs.
While a million or more
Americans have seen Japan
at first hand in war
or peace, other millions
may conceive it to be a
part of the dreamy, hot,
primitive East Asia. It has
wide varieties in temperature
from end to end, for
it has a range like ours
from Maine to Miami. But
this is an essentially northern
latitude nation with
its heartland enjoying, if
you like that sort of climate,
about the weather
consistency of Washington
or Cincinnati.
Cold statistics cannot
convey what the Japanese
have accomplished since
and before the war. It
must be seen and felt. But
some figures may help to
convey the transformation.
Japan produced 140,000
electric motors in 1935;
277,000 in 1950; 2,430,000
in 1957. It produced 16,000
motorcars and trucks in
1935; 68,000 in 1950; 296,-
000 in 1957. It made 17,000
cameras in 1935; 188,000 in
1950; 1,636,000 in 1957.
Japan is the world’s
largest shipbuilder. From
a base of zero at the war’s
end, it has risen to 700,-
000 gross tons in launch-
ings and to 1,600,000 tons
in ships under construction.
Food production, despite
the fact that most of Japan’s
area is mountainous,
has caught up relatively
with the population increase.
Japan’s birth and
death rates are, despite
its population rise to 92,-
000,000, below those of the
United States.
The concept held by the
Japanese imperialists in
1940, as well as by Germans
for a generation before
the war—that a rising
tide of population and productive
power needs expansion,
if necessary by
armed conquest—was always
an illusion. The present
Japanese know this.
They have had a terrible
lesson.
And, if Japanese history
shows anything, the prevailing
mood will last for
two or three centuries.
The pre-war concept of a
greater East Asia co-prosperity
policy abides, but
without the belief in military
conquest.
