A $50 Million Medical Proposal
With Some Socialistic Overtones
Perhaps this piece will
appear to some that its
author is against health,
motherhood, love, peace
and sweet charity. At any
rate, so it may appear to
the 60 senators who voted
for or favored Senate Joint
Resolution 41. It would
not appear so to Sens:
Bennett, Butler, Capehart,
Curtis, Dirksen, Dworshak,
Ellender, Holland, Hrus-
ka, Langer, Lausche, Mc-
Clellan, Robertson, Rus-
sell, Schoeppel, Thurmond
and Williams, who voted
against the resolution. Nor
to Sen. Byrd, who was not
present but was opposed.
The resolution, with a
lot of gobbledygook about
the senators' passion for
health and peace, would
appropriate $50 million to
provide a "national in-
stitute for international
health and medical re-
search," presided over by
the surgeon general, and
tied into various agencies
of the federal government
with concerns in the gen-
eral field of public health
and research. It would
thus tie a sizable part of
our public health agencies
and money into the World
Health Organization, an
agency of the United Na-
tions.
We are already quite
closely committed to the
worthy goal of internation-
al health promotion. We
are actually a member of
the WHO. And on the pri-
vate level, we are mem-
bers of the World Medical
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Assn, which was organ-
ized by the American Med-
ical Assn.
It is hard to see what
this new agency would
add to our efforts in the
combating of disease ev-
erywhere. It would, how-
ever, bring us closer offi-
cially to the many nations
which have abolished the
private practice of medi-
cine for government medi-
cine. And it would spend
another $50 million, which
would have to be borrowed
or printed.
When the World Health
Organization was formed
in 1948, Alger Hiss, speak-
ing for the Carnegie En-
dowment for International
Peace, of which he was
president, issued a booklet
in praise thereof. He might
have been reminded that
if the Carnegie, Rockefel-
ler and other foundations
would stop making useless
studies of unknowable and
sometimes unintelligible
mysteries of social sci-
ences and spend their
funds as did the Rocke-
feller Foundation in its
first 10 years in promot-
ing medical research and
training over the world,
there would be better
health and just as much
peace. The same might be
said for the Ford Founda-
tion, although it has more
recently given more atten-
tion to that boundless field
for good work.
The real end of such an
agency as is proposed was
spelled out by an ardent
welfare-stater from New
Jersey, House member
Thompson, who would ex-
tend these explorations
into the underlying "ori-
gin, nature and solution
of health problems not
identifiable in terms of dis-
ease entities." Brushing
aside the jargon, it means
that if we rend aside the
social order and set up a
socialistic welfare state,
nobody would get sick and
everyone would be happy.
This was the plan
pursued in the 1920s when
the Rockefeller Founda-
tion turned from its mag-
nificent work in helping
medical education the
world over and went in for
"social science." Mr. Gates,
who had guided well the
elder Rockefeller's bene-
factions up to that time,
protested against this di-
version but was brushed
aside as an old fogy.
But if we measure the
results of the exploration
by the successors of Gates,
we shall find how little
has been accomplished by
this sort of "research," and
how right he was in his
protest.
There are no people in
the world more concerned
with health and medical
advancement than Ameri-
cans. Why should there be
another chunk of bureauc-
racy to institutionalize
this national policy and,
incidentally, why spend
$50 million that we haven't
got?
