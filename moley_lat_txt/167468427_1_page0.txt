MONTGOMERY, Ala.—
Parents of eight Negro
children in Birmingham
are seeking to have them
enrolled in white schools.
This may be another test
of the Alabama Placement
Law passed in 1957. Bir-
mingham school officials
are now testing these cases
under the law.
The superintendent of
schools in Birmingham
says that the applications
are being processed by the
guidance department,
which is charged with ap-
plications of all students
for transfer. Four of the
Negro children seek en-
trance to grade schools
and four to high schools.
The father of three of
the children, a minister
and integration leader,
says that his objective is
not to test the law but to
get the children into
school. "We are trying for
admission on good faith,"
he added.

Under the ruling of the
Supreme Court on the Ala-
bama law, the school au-
thorities will be required
to show good faith and no
intention to base their test-
ing on racial grounds.
This decision was a
bright spot in the whole
integration controversy. It
substantially agreed with
a ruling by Judge Albert
V. Bryan some months
ago. The Bryan decision
may well prove to be a
landmark in a long strug-
gle between the states de-
termined to preserve "sep-
arate but equal" schools
and the people seeking
complete integration.
If these tests are to be-
come general for all chil-
dren, white and Negro, the
result may well mean a
revolutionary change for
the better in all southern
schools. The public schools
of Virginia, I was told
when I visited the state
last week, had been grow-
ing about as "progressive"
as those elsewhere.
There was the steady
softening of the curricu-
lum, which meant that
Johnny was getting less of
reading, writing, and
arithmetic and more of a
variety of leisure-time ac-
tivities.
*
If Negro children are re-
quired to meet stiff tests in
academic subjects, the au-
thorities, in order to sus-
tain the test of good faith,
will ultimately have to im-
pose the same standards
upon all children of both
races.
Something of this out-
come has been seen in the
schools of the District of
Columbia where, in order
to avoid an utter break-
down of all standards un-
der an indiscriminate inte-
gration court order, a four-
lane system was estab-
lished. Under this system
the brightest students—
white or Negro—are given
the most exacting instruc-
tion. Below them are three
other grades based on ca-
pacity.
Who knows but that this
example in the South may
permeate the North as
well, where a deadly uni-
formity generally prevails
under the term "progres-
sive education?"
