According to the record,
the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority was indebted to the
U.S. Treasury $1,196,000,
000, and under legislation
previously passed by Con-
gress was required to re-
pay this in a period of 40
years.
In a bill passed last week
by the Senate and in sub-
stantially the same form
by the House in May, this
indebtedness was slashed
to $1 billion, with 54 years
to pay. The reports of the
TVA show no lack of abil-
ity to pay the original
amount in full, for the
profits of the agency have
been very substantial.
In fact, it is the size of
those profits which
prompted the bill itself,
which would permit the
TVA to issue its own reve-
nue bonds and thus finance
its own expansion. Efforts
to give it this self-financ-
ing authority have been
under way for some years.

The time has long passed
since the TVA was a hy-
droelectric institution with
vast plans to develop the
rivers of the region for the
benefit of its inhabitants.
At present 70% of the
power generated is by
steam plants.
It is, in effect, a vast
government power monop-
oly extending its services
over several states. Its
freedom from the normal
obligations resting upon
investor-owned utilities
gives it this monopolistic
position.
It is difficult to see now
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
—with the new power pro-
posed in the bill for expan-
sion within and without
the territory now served
—how any private com-
pany can compete with it.
Under the terms of this
bill, the TVA may issue up
to $750 million in revenue
bonds. These are said to
be no obligation of the U.S.
government, but the comp-
troller general of the Unit-
ed States has said repeat-
edly that they are really a
moral obligation.
*
Superficially, the au-
thority given to the TVA
to finance its own expan-
sion would relieve the tax-
payers of the United States
from an obligation to sub-
sidize this full-grown in-
stitution from the Treas-
ury. That is something
that is favored by every-
one, including President
Eisenhower.
The argument over the
years since the plan was
first brought before Con-
gress has concerned the
power of the President
and Congress to maintain
some control over an insti-
tution which was the crea-
tion of the federal govern-
ment and which is, in
reality, an agency of that
government.
The President has
recommended that the
Treasury and the Bureau
of the Budget exercise
some control over the issu-
ance of the revenue bonds
and the plans for expan-
sion. The present bill fails
to do so. The Treasury is
permitted only to pass on
the rate of interest and the
time of issuing the bonds.
As for expansion be-
yond the present domain
in which the TVA oper-
ates, there is plenty of au-
thority to expand indefi-
nitely. Under the terms of
the bill, the TVA may
move into any state in
which it was serving in
any way on July 1, 1957.
While there is a limita-
tion on the area it may
add to its domain—2,000
square miles in all or 500
square miles in any state
—the terms of the bill
would permit it, within
these limitations, through a
power supplier to sell pow-
er now served to cities
having a population of
5,000 or less, or to cities up
to 10,000 which own their
own distribution systems.
Thus, with transmission
lines, the TVA might with-
in the limit of an area of
500 square miles move
practically over the states
on its periphery. It could
service hundreds of towns
and cities and charge com-
petitive rates which could
not possibly be met by tax-
paying, investor-owned
companies.
Whether, in the term
now being applied in Con-
gress to most important
legislation, this bill has
been made "veto proof" re-
mains to be seen. It is cer-
tainly not in line with the
philosophy and specifica-
tions repeatedly stated by
the President.
