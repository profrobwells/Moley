End of Cross-Filing in California
Will Strengthen Two-Party System

The Democratic Legisla-
ture now in session in Sac-
ramento has repealed the
old legislation which per-
mitted candidates to file in
the primaries of both par-
ties.

This system was
amended a while ago to re-
quire that candidates who
cross-filed should have
with their names on the
ballot an indication of the
party to which they be-
longed. Now the whole
system has been aban-
doned and Democrats will
be on the Democratic pri-
mary ballot and Repub-
licans on the Republican.
Cross-filing was one of
the methods adopted al-
most half a century ago
when Hiram Johnson as
governor was in a bitter
fight with the controlling
elements in his own Re-
publican Party. The re-
forms adopted then almost
obliterated two-party gov-
ernment in the state. This
medicine all but killed the
patients.

Few candidates pro-
fessed more than casual
loyalty to their party and
some in fact were of most
shadowy party affiliation.
When Jimmy Roosevelt
was running for governor
against the incumbent
Earl Warren he said, "I
don't want to make this a
dirty campaign, but before
I finish I shall establish
the fact that Warren is a
Republican." That fact,

BY RAYMOND MOLEY
some say, was never clear-
ly established despite Jim-
my's threat.

Warren and his succes-
sor, Goodwin Knight, pret-
ty clearly differentiated
their campaigns from oth-
er Republicans on the
ticket. It was generally
every candidate for him-
self.

Curious things hap-
pened, such as a case some
years ago when an excel-
lent congressman failed to
get a majority on his own
ticket but won on the oth-
er. But the law was suf-
ficiently inconsistent to
prohibit his running at all
in the election.

No informed Californian
will claim that real two-
party government has
ever, since the days of
Hiram Johnson, really ex-
isted in California. Until
the labor unions began to
beef up the Democratic
Party it was a shadowy af-
fair.

Factions and rivalries
plagued the Republicans
and in 1958 the GOP, split
wide open, suffered a ter-
rific trouncing.

Non-partisanship be-
came the vogue and voters
with no party in which to
invest their loyalty found
homes in all sorts of move-
ments, sects and crusades.
For the thing that some
reformers cannot realize is
that human beings have to
cleave to something. They
are gregarious animals

and when the tie of party
disappears in politics they
vote according to some
other loyalty, be it reli-
gion, or race, or economic
interest. The citizen hates
to walk alone.

The Democrats passed
this repeal of cross-filing
for no theoretical reason.
They have a big majority
of registered voters and
this change, they hope,
will keep the members of
their flock from straying
into Republican pastures.
But registration has never
imposed much of an obli-
gation on a voter to vote
for his nominal party.

Some Republicans re-
gret this repeal because it
may temporarily handi-
cap them and prevent
them from gathering the
votes of conservative
Democrats whose party
heritage might inhibit
them from voting a Re-
publican ticket.

But it was notable that
a number of the intelligent
Republican members of
Congress expressed in
Washington their approv-
al of the change. They be-
lieve that the change will
increase party responsibil-
ity and, in the end,
strengthen their party.
I am heartily in agree-
ment with them. For un-
less there can be estab-
lished a better two-party
system in this country we
shall forever be at the
mercy of minority pres-
sure groups.
