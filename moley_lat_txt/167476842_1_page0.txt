Khrushchev Must Be Made Aware
That America Is Strong and United
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In man-to-man talks, in
editorials and columns,
and in a mass of letters to
the editor, the wisdom of
the President's decision to
invite Khrushchev to this
country has been debated.
On balance. it seems that
majority opinion backs the
President.
Some ardently believe
that the exchange of visits
will soften tensions and
ease the cold war. Others
view the visits as an invi-
tation to greater tensions
and a strengthening of the
communist power every-
where.
Still others, with grave
doubts as to the outcome.
believe that these visits
will accomplish what
everyone wants some
firm and frank talk, face
to face, about the nation's
determination to yield
nothing in principle.

An ultimatum does not
necessarily need to be de-
livered in a hostile man-
ner and at long range. It
can be expressed, as Nix-
on said it, with the great-
est atmosphere of affabil-
ity. At any rate, it cannot
be misunderstood if deliv-
ered in that way.
Finally, a great many of
us are sufficiently realistic
to regard the matter as a
fait accompli. The invita-
tions have been extended
and accepted, the visits
will be made. And most of
those who recognize that
fact may well have had
grave doubts about the
timing and even the de-
sirability of the visits at
all. It seems to me that
this is the correct attitude.
My firm admiration for
those who, even now,
would postpone or cancel
the visits is very great.
Most of these people have
stood firmly and coura-
geously for sound, con-
servative principles at
home and abroad for a
long time.
They realize that the
concessions made by this
administration to social-
istic schemes at home have
not and cannot satisfy
radicals but only whet
their appetites.
They also know that our
foreign policy as admin-
istered before Dulles took
charge was characterized
by a tragic misconception.
It was the major reason
for the spread of commu-
nism. These people are the
hard core of conservatism
in this country and for
that they should be re-
spected, even when mis-
taken.
But let us see what
would happen if the Presi-
dent should follow their
advice and cancel or post-
pone the visits. Here and
all over the world he
would be characterized as
a weak statesman whose
mind is swayed by the
breezes of opinion.

In the free world his
leadership would be shat-
tered. In the communist
world there would be con-
firmation of the present
claim that the United
States is weak, divided,
and afraid. This would be
wonderful material for
propaganda.
The harm that these op-
ponents see is that this
acceptance of Khrushchev
will greatly enhance his
popularity and prestige in
the communist world. But
this implies that the com-
mon people of Russia and
its satellites want closer
relations. This is in itself
a reason for more personal
contact.
Since the sentiments of
those who oppose the vis-
its will not appreciably
change, they might find it
well during Khrushchev's
visit to find means to ex-
press their inalterable op-
position to his philosophy
and system of government
in newspaper advertise-
ments, in letters, and
round robins to him, clear-
ly specifying that they
are people of substance
who can also argue with
reason and restraint.
★
In short, to omit talk
about Khrushchev as a
"butcher," etc., but to
state clearly what this
country is and what it
stands for. Prayer meet-
ings might help. They
would at any rate get peo-
ple into churches who sel-
dom attend at other times.
This visit, if it is to be
successful, must be
marked by good manners
on the part of Americans.
This is plain common
sense. Performing the
amenities need never be a
surrender of principles.
The visits are going to
be made. That is settled.
The President is in charge
of foreign relations. We
have elected him for that
purpose. He cannot be ex-
pected to take a poll every
time he has to make a de-
cision. The demands of or-
derly, representative gov-
ernment are such that
when a decision is made it
is time to close ranks at
home.
