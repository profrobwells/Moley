Khrushchev's Muscle-Flexing Bares
Flabby Tone of Kremlin's Strength
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two factors have been neglected in
the discussion of the threat of war
over the Berlin situation. The first is
that the masters of the Soviets are
essentially politicians. Their power is
not as absolute as it seems.
Despite heavy censorship, there is
something of a restraint placed upon
them by palace politics and public opinion.
The threat of war and even war
itself are an extension of the play of
politics. Hence, after Khrushchev's
boorish treatment of Prime Minister
Macmillan and his bellicose speech during
Macmillan's visit, he added an explanation
a few days later.
He was reported to have said that because
of an election on March 1 the
speech must be taken with the salt
that usually is necessary with political
utterances, that it was "only
an electioneering speech."
Americans should be used
to that sort of thing.
The other factor is the
military situation of the Soviet.
Regardless of missiles
and Sputniks, the waging of
a war with the West must
be conditioned by the temper
of the ring of satellites
that divides Russia from the
West.
They are no more anxious
to provide the battleground
for an atomic conflict than
are France, Italy and Britain. And they
are closer to the line of conflict. Poland,
Hungary and East Germany are
populated by people who, by tradition
and by the Soviet occupation, are permanently
steeped in a bitter hatred of
Russia and Russians.
At the very outbreak of a general
war, with Soviet troops confronted by
the western powers, these satellites
would, to use the words of a very competent
expert in European affairs,
"blow up in the face of Russia."
German blood runs thick and deep,
and the Khrushchev gesture of leaving
the defense of Berlin to the East Germans
is playing with words. He can
have no such real intention. All the
elements of revolt in East Germany and
Poland, which have already manifested
themselves despite the presence of vast
Soviet forces, would flare up with terrific
intensity.
We already know that Hungarians
have been willing to strike, even when
odds were hopeless against them. Instead
of having satellites to help, the
Soviet would have traditional enemies
to control. Nobody but a madman
would provoke a real war with this element
of instability facing him.
And Khrushchev is no madman, however
his actions may indicate a dangerous
emotional instability.
The danger of watering
down the martial spirit of
Russian divisions after even
a short stay in the proximity
of the West is already
apparent. Hence, the continuous
shifting of divisions
from East Germany and
other satellites to and from
their native soil.
The concept of the Communist
world as a monolith-
ic power imbued with the
fervor of world conquest is
a myth. It is really a very
shaky aggregation of incongruous
elements.
I can well realize that it is dangerous
to make predictions as to what might
happen concerning Berlin, just as it was
in the case of Matsu and Quemoy. But
the facts all point to the improbability
of war and the assurance that the
Khrushchev regime will continue for a
long time the policy of "no war, no
peace." It is no time for Americans to
weaken their unity with panic. Never
was it more important to hold a firm
front.
