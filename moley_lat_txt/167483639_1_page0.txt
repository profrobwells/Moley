Democratization of Japan Opens
Door to Communist Subversion
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the course of my
three weeks' visit in Ja-
pan, it became increasingly
apparent that this reviv-
ing nation, now approach-
ing economically the sta-
tus of a world power, has
a very, very serious prob-
lem in dealing with inter-
nal Communist subver-
sion.
*
Communists in Red
China and in japan itself
realize that a capitalistic,
prosperous country in Asia
will, through its example,
have great influence on
the 700 million people
who are still free of com-
munism in Southeast Asia
and on the 600 million in
Red China itself.
The alluring picture of
a small and resources-poor
island country, beaten and
devastated by war, reviv-
ing as it has in 13 years,
makes the lumbering prog-
ress of communism in Chi-
na a shabby alternative,
even when it is portrayed
by lying propaganda.
Hence, there are des-
perate efforts by Commu-
nists to disrupt Japan by
internal subversion. This
is a grave peril, because
Japan lies at the very
doorstep of Communist
China and Russia.
*
The problem of govern-
ment in Japan, therefore,
is to maintain the security
of its government and in-
stitutions and economic
life, in the face of this
ever-present threat.
Its difficulty was made
acute by the peli-mell ef-
formers who were sent
over there during the oc-
cupation. Some of these
were eggheads who, after
years of effort to make
over the United States
with only indifferent suc-
cess, rushed over to oper-
ate with no inhibiting cir-
cumstances upon a recum-
bent, passive nation.
Gen. MacArthur was a
very busy man, managing
a big nation with all sorts
of needs, commanding a
vast American armed
force, watching the moves
of external enemies, and
finally waging a full-dress
war in Korea. It is little
wonder that subordinates
in many cases went their
sweet way.
*
The Japanese constitu-
tion, adopted under the
auspices of the American
occupation; attempted in
one gigantic sweep to im-
pose upon a nation which
had only emerged from
feudalism a century ago
virtually all of the demo-
cratic institutions which
had been laboriously de-
veloped by Anglo-Saxons
in the course of long gen-
erations of growth.
And there were several
embellishments which
even Britain and the Unit-
ed States had not yet
adopted, such as the re-
nunciation of war as a
means of national survival
and the denial of practi-
cally all armed means for
defense.
In the constitution and
the legislation under it,
there were drastic land
reform, a new labor move-
ment, universal suffrage,
decentralized government
and administration, and
the fragmentation of the
industrial structure. The
Japanese, quick at adapta-
tion, have done well with
some of these changes.
But others have created
very serious difficulties.
*
So far as the structure
of government is con-
cerned, it should be noted
that what the occupation
had to build upon was a
conglomerate of adapta-
tions from many nations
prior to the war, together
with large vestiges of
what was present before
the West entered Japan
back in the middle of the
19th century.
There were and are a sort
of parliamentary and cabi-
net system borrowed from
Britain, local governments
partly of French design
(the local units are still
called prefectures), and an
emperor above all. Our
contributions were to de-
mocratize the upper house
of the National Diet and
to make the prefectures
virtually sovereign in vi-
tal respects. The latter are
completely unlike the
French system, which is
based upon a centralized
national government.
*
Most serious in weak-
ening Japan's capacity to
combat communism was
our insistence upon the
reorganization of the na-
tion's police system. In
another column I shall tell
about that reform and its
consequences.
