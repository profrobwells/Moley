Public-power advocates
in the Northwest, including
most of the members
of Congress representing
that area, are apparently
in high good spirits.
In Oregon the re-election
of Sen. Neuberger is almost
assured, now that he has
the advantage of Sen.
Morse's opposition.
The Oregon state Republican organization, after
failing to beat public
power opponents in senatorial and congressional
races, has apparently decided to join them. And
the new Republican governor is making like a
bristling liberal.

With this sort of sentiment abroad, the Senate
has passed one of the most
indefensible power projects since the days of
Harold Ickes. The estimated cost is "only $50
million," which is not considered worth a roll call
these days in the Senate.
This one passed by voice
vote. It now goes to the
House.
The bill gives the Bureau of Reclamation authority to construct what
is called a "reregulating
reservoir" at the Burns
Creek site on the Snake
River in southeastern
Idaho.
It seems to have been passed as a reclamation project, but reclamation will have precious little to do with it. It is a
federal power project,
which is proved by the
fact that 98% of the cost
is to be charged to power
and only 2% to irrigation.
So far as its need as a
power source is concerned,
the region involved is already completely served
and its population satisfied with the supply of
power from the two big
companies operating in
the area. There is no recognizable power shortage
in prospect in the area.
The competition with
those companies would certainly mean less consumption of coal, and thus
less employment in the
coal-producing states
nearby. It would mean
that coal needed for power generation would be
cut 250,000 tons a year and
thus eliminate 20,000 man-
shifts in the mines.
★
For this reason, the
project was opposed, unsuccessfully so far, by the
United Mine Workers, notably the locals in the
Wyoming-Utah coal-producing region. These miners are already pretty
hard hit by the general
use of diesel engines on
the railways.
The bill was pushed under the entirely erroneous
and deceptive claim that
it was an irrigation project. But according to
Regional Reclamation Director Nelson, the water to
be stored by the Burns
Creek project would only
be needed "possibly two
or three times in 50
years."
But in those 50 years
the government would be
losing taxes at the rate of
$472,000 a year because
of the reduction in the
operation of the private
investor-owned utilities
serving the region.
The average net revenue to be collected from
the federal power installation would fall short of
meeting the interest payments on the federal money advanced by more than
$300,000 a year.
All this passed casually,
it seems, by the prospect of
votes in 1960. As always,
the bill must be paid by
the taxpayers of states and
regions far from the project—taxpayers who, because of the monumental
size and complexity of
their government, hardly
know any more what is
happening to their money.
A famous victory for
zealots for socialistic power! And "only" $50 million
in cost, plus interest lost
and taxes uncollected from
companies willing to supply the power.
