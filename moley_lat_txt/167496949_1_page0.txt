No Part of New York Is Safe
in Mounting Juvenile Terrorism

Crime and violence in
New York City, as the en-
tire United States knows
well, are.not news. And
the frightening increase of
disorder among the teen-
agers is also well.known.
But too often these phe-
nomena are described in
long gray words such as
"juvenile delinquency" or
"disrespect for authority."
These characterizations
cannot convey the reality
of this blot on the reputa-
tion of a city which prides
itself on its enlightenment
and civilizing influences.
The reality is a glaring
accumulation of instances
which now crowd Khru-
shchev and President Ei-
senhower for front-page
space in the press. It is the
major topic of conversa-
tion. Taxi drivers, who
live close to life in all its
grim manifestations, ply
their patrons with hair-
raising details.

Many of those useful
people are literally living
in deathly fear, for they
live close to danger con-
stantly. Many have given
up working after 4 in the
afternoon. Some will re-
fuse to carry a fare to
Harlem. I have talked with
several who themselves
have been assaulted and
robbed in that area.
The problem of crime in
Harlem has been with us
a long time, although the
number of Negroes migrat-
ing from the South has in-
creased some in the past
few years. The most se-
rious situation is ocса-
sioned by the 700,000 im-
migrants from Puerto
Rico, who are coming in-
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
to New York at the rate of
40,000 a year. The Ne-
groes themselves harbor a
deep resentment and fear
of these newcomers.
At first, the Puerto Ri-
cans were in large part
concentrated in East. Har-
lem, in a district repre-
sented in Congress for
years by the late Mayor
La Guardia and subse-
quently by Vito Marcan-
tonio. The various welfare
and "placement" officials,
in getting roofs over these
newcomers, have scat-
tered them all over the
city. This means that the
criminal infection may
break out anywhere in the
large boroughs.

The incidence of crime
among youths between 16
and 20 steadily increases.
In the first seven months
of this year, these young
savages registered 4,566
felonies, an increase over
the previous year of more
than 12%.
It is interesting to note
in the police deparment's
tabulation that murder
and non-negligent man-
slaughter increased 26.7%,
while burglary slightly de-
clined. Grand larceny of
motor vehicles increased
in the age group 33.3%.
Thus, the criminal activ-
ity of these hoodlums
ranges from ordinary
stealing to bloody assaults
and big stealing.
More shocking still are
the figures for those un-
der 16. In this group the
killings have increased
30% and grand larceny
26.5%. Crimes involving
narcotics have increased
among these children.
For several years, it has
been suicidal carelessness
for women to walk in the
streets in the neighbor-
hood of Columbia under
the shadow of the Cathe-
dral of St. John the Di-
vine. That was once a
quiet and decent neighbor-
hood. Likewise, Central
Park is dangerous even in
the daytime.
Armed gangs of these
young criminals prolifer-
ate in almost every part
of the city. These are
clearly identifiable by the
arrogant names adopted
by the gangs. There are
more than 7,000 known
members of these terror-
ist organizations. It seems
strange that if newspa-
per reporters can, as they
do, identify these groups
by name and location, the
police cannot move in on
them and break them up
forcefully.

But the city administra-
tion, instead, treats them
as if they were sovereign
bodies with which for-
mal negotiations are car-
ried on in the spirit of "we
will let you go on as a
gang but please don't
fight among yourselves."
Apparently, the city ad-
ministration merely asks
for amicable coexistence
with the enemies of de-
cent people.
In another column I
shall have something to
say about the welfare
"panty-waist" approaches
to these criminals which
have permitted this ter-
ror to increase to this
frightening extent and al-
so the shameful political
pandering which has re-
strained authority to deal
with these ethnic groups.
