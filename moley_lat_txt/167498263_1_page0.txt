RAYMOND MOLEY:
Japanese Minister
Firm Friend of U.S.
TOKYOâ€”Aiichiro Fuji-
yama, foreign minister in
the Kishi Liberal-Demo-
cratic government of Ja-
pan, is a businessman of
40 years' experience who
has been successful in po-
litical life.
Before the Pacific war
he was the highly success-
ful head of a number of
business enterprises. He
served a while as presi-
dent of the Tokyo Cham-
ber of Commerce and also
of the Chamber of Com-
merce of Japan.
During the war he had
his first experience in pub-
lic office, as personal as-
sistant to the minister of
the navy. In that post he
did what he could to
strengthen the navy's re-
luctance to be identified
with the militaristic aims
of the Tojo government.
*
Tojo, as a leader and in-
dividual, Mr. Fujiyama
heartily disliked. But as
history proved, the navy
was swept along by the
tide of militarism and suf-
fered terrible disaster. Aft-
er the war Mr. Fujiyama
was the loyal friend and
supporter of the present
prime minister, Nobusuke
Kishi.
His long experience in
manufacturing and com-
merce prepared him for
his present post, because
Japan's foreign policy is
basically related to trade
and industry.
During my visit with
him he freely talked for
the record on the economic
problems facing the new
and prosperous Japan. He
pointed out that Japan is
a small island nation with
a vital need for imports
of raw materials and mar-
kets to supply with manu-
factured goods. Its chief
market is Southeast Asia,
with the United States
next.
So far as exports to the
United States are con-
cerned, the need is to sell
us small products identi-
fied with small industries
essential to the mainte-
nance of Japan's crowded
population. The United
States is also a prospective
customer for Japan's very
important shipbuilding in-
dustry, notably in tankers.
So far as steel is con-
cerned, the American mar-
ket is small. Japan itself
uses 80% of its manufac-
tured steel.
Because of various com-
plications with American
textile manufacturers, Ja-
pan has voluntarily cut
down its exports to the
U.S. It has no wish to
flood the American market
with cheap textiles. Fine
and expensive fabrics are
another matter, and since
these are popular in the
U.S., and since the U.S.
is the only country rich
enough to buy them, there
is no great problem in that
direction.
Other items for export
to the U.S. are small tran-
sistor radios, optical goods,
camera equipment, and
other luxury goods.
*
The sincerity of the for-
eign minister's friendship
for the U.S. is very appar-
ent. He stands firmly with
the Kishi government's
firm opposition to commu-
nism and Communist
countries.
The U.S. can do busi-
ness with Mr. Fujiyama on
a basis of equality of treat-
ment and the unique ar-
ticulation of our respec-
tive interests.
He is a man who sees
things in broad and com-
prehensive terms. Also in
the spirit of new Japan,
which has put the long
past behind it, including
its prewar unfortunate
experience with milita-
rism and territorial expan-
sion by force.
