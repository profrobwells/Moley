TOKYO — Here in this
island nation, after traveling
thousands of miles
over the salty sea, the lessons
in the book, "The
Sea Around Us," come to
mind, and especially what
the author said about the
unused wealth that lies
under the waves.
But of all those riches,
the water itself is most
valuable. And converted to
use on the land and for
the millions of human beings
who live in water-
scarce areas, it might well
transform civilization.
*
There is certainly no
scarcity of water here in
Japan. There is an abundance
of rainfall, and Japan's
mountains hold
quantities of snow which
supply gushing rivers.
Water power is one of its
natural resources. But to
the Southern United
States, a water scarcity is
an ever-present concern.
Consider the labors,
struggles, arguments in
courts, and even the
bloody encounters over
water rights in the great
areas west of the Mississippi.
Billions have been
spent to see that every
trickle that flows from the
Rockies is used to the utmost.
States are at each other's
throats in the courts
over the waters of the
Colorado. California is discussing
a huge project to
carry fresh water from the
moist north to the needy
south.
Always in the background
there has been the
glimmering mirage of converting
the limitless waters
of the sea to the uses
of the land with its people
and animals. For
years, the Department of
the Interior has been
working on the problem
of conversion of salt water.
There are many
schemes to do the trick—
some theories, some actual
processes—which yield
minute results.
But last month Interior
Secretary Fred Seaton
made an announcement
which lighted the anticipation
of many Californians.
He said that a certain
process, called a "long-
tube vertical multiple-effect
distillation" has been
selected for concentrated
efforts to bring conversion
within the limits of financial
possibility.
"This process," he said,
"gives promise of a breakthrough."
He hopes that a
demonstration plant in operation
will convert at the
rate of a million gallons a
day. This, he hopes, will
produce fresh water for
all purposes for less than
$1 per 1,000 gallons.
This represents a reduction
of 50% under the
most efficient commercial
plant in operation in the
world. Many cities are in
competition for demonstration
plants which the department
will build.
*
Under a federal law
passed last year, $10 million
will be available for
five demonstration plants.
Three of these will convert
sea water and will be
located on the East, West,
and Gulf Coasts. Two will
deal with brackish water,
one to be located in the
arid Southwest, and the
other in the Northern
Great Plains.
Thus the generation
now in its teens will have
something to look forward
to beside heavier taxes
and socialization inflicted
by their fathers and mothers.
In vast areas in certain
states, every prospect
pleases — but only water is
vile — or scarce.
