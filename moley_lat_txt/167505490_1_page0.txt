Nixon Escapes Responsibility
for Khrushchev Visit to U.S.
In terms of the most
realistic of political spec-
usation, it is most fortu-
nate for Vice-President
Nixon that the President
has hastened to inform
the country that the idea
of a visit by Khrushchev
to the United States orig-
inated with him and that
Secretary Herter con-
veyed the invitation
through Soviet channels
before Nixon left for
Moscow. This makes it
clear that the plan was not
an informal suggestion by
Nixon amid the exciting
events of his Russian vis-
it.
Nixon has never been a
man to shirk a risk to his
political fortunes if there
was a hard job to do or
if the President made the
request. His trip to Mos-
cow was a great but cal-
culated risk to his politi-
cal future. He made metic-
ulous plans and prepara-
tion for it but, as it seemed
before he went, the
chances that it would be
a colossal flop were con-
siderable.
There was skepticism at
home and among our Eu-
ropean allies. Prime Min-
ister Macmillan had utter-
ly failed to melt the Soviet
ice. Nixon's political ene-
mies in both parties were
aware that failure would
greatly help either in the
nomination of some other
Republican or the election
of a Democrat in 1960.
The invitation to Khru-
shchev was another and

even greater risk. The
greatest peril is that our
hospitality for the visitor
may be marred by demon-
strations. Bitter enemies
of the Soviet may break
through our protocol with
protests. In short, Ameri-
cans may lose the contest
in good manners in which
the Russian people set so
high a mark in receiving
the Vice-President. The
paucity of concessions in
the larger issues between
the two countries may
plunge Americans into
deeper pessimism about a
respite in the cold war.
Things went all right
when the two lesser So-
viet lights were over here
earlier in the year. But
Mr. K is the big boss. This
is it! This is the man who
is responsible for so many
things that have deeply
stirred the indignation of
so many Americans. There
have already appeared in
the press suggestions of
morbid demonstrations.

An important journalist
who is not friendly to Nix-
on as a possible Presi-
dential candidate told me
since the invitation to
Mr. K was extended and
accepted and announced
that the "whole idea was
Ike's" and was intended
to deflate Nixon. My re-
ply was that I doubted
any motive on the Presi-
dent's part except to fur-
ther the cause of better
relations but that if the
motive he suggested were
the correct one the Pres-
ident and Secretary Her-
ter would soon be tossing
a pretty hot potato from
one hand to another un-
til the ordeal is over.
Also, the success of the
Khrushchev visit would be
most important to us all.
As matters stand, Nixon
has returned with pretty
general acclaim. His prep-
aration and resourceful-
ness proved admirable for
the mission. He had shown
that the best course is to
foster closer contacts and
more understanding be-
tween the peoples of the
two countries. That will
stand in his favor, what-
ever may happen.

As a John the Baptist
he has spoken well. He has
shown that he is not a reed
bent by the wind nor a
man clad in soft garments.
In pursuing the Biblical
theme a bit further, it may
be remarked that, while
martyrdom awaited those
for whom John was the
advance evangelist, John
escaped that. True, he lost
his head. But that was, ac-
cording to the Gospels, be-
cause of a concatenation
of events in which the
capricious cavortings of
Salome and Herod played
a major part. Generally,
the announcer suffers the
least from the failure of
a show.
With the Rockefeller
storm troops poised for
attack and the Democratic
contenders stocking their
arsenals, Nixon will have
plenty to do at home now.
