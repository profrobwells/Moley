Local Control of Government Aid
Funds Curbs Welfare State Evils
The British government
on April 1 last revolution-
ized its system of making
national grants to the local
communities. It provided
that money hitherto giv-
en to 147 county and bor-
ough councils for specific
purposes such as educa-
tion, health, child care,
fire protection, etc., should
hereafter be in the form
of general over-all grants.
Local authorities, who
must supplement the sup-
port of these welfare serv-
ices from local taxation,
may allocate these grants
as they see fit. This action
by the Conservative gov-
ernment presently in pow-
er was bitterly opposed by
the Labor minority.

This change embodies a
profound lesson for the
United States, if our law-
makers and public opinion
will only appreciate its
meaning. For the growth
of specific or "program-
matic" grants is the rule
here, and its effect is to
clamp down, to a greater
and greater degree, the
domination of the federal
bureaucracy upon our lo-
cal governments. The
number and amounts of
these "programmatic"
grants by the federal gov-
ernment and the states
has grown at jet speed
since 1930. Before that
year of depression until
1952, the figure grew from

insignificant amounts to
$2.6 billion. Then it leaped
to $7.1 billion for the fiscal
year beginning next
month. And the end is not
yet, for there are all sorts
of programs for, federal
aid now before Congress.

The evil in this system
of giving federal grants for
specific programs is two-
fold. It lessens the sense
of responsibility in the
state or local community.
The citizens there delude
themselves by believing
that federal money is free
money, although they
should realize that all
federal money comes from
local communities.
At the other end of the
line, in Washington, im-
mense pressure organiza-
tions such as the National
Education Assn. build up
lobbies for their pet pur-
poses and to a greater and
greater degree work hand
in hand with federal bu-
reaucrats who are eternal-
ly seeking more money to
spend, more subordinates
to boss, and more local au-
thorities to regulate. If this
trend is not checked, we
shall end up with a great,
centralized government
which will impose a dead-
ly uniformity over the life
of local communities. Also,
there is growing now, in
fact, a new sort of govern-
ment wherein great pres-
sure groups installed in
commodious office build-
ings in Washington throw
irresistible pressure on
Congress and the executive
departments.
In presenting the plan
for general grants before
the House of Commons,
the ministries of housing
and of education argued
that general rather than
"programmatic" grants
would strengthen the char-
acter of local government
and at the same time effect
economy because of more
local surveillance over the
various activities involved.
When money was given for
housing, education, or
other welfare activities, it
was not regarded as nec-
essary that local councils
take pains to watch ex-
penditures, and because of
the ultimate authority's be-
ing lodged in London there
was less efficiency exer-
cised from there. Under
general grants, there can
be lively interest in the
community over the way
it is to be allocated. Inev-
itably, this creates much
more vitality in local af-
fairs.

The same advantages
would be gained in the
United States under such
a system, with even more
emphasis, because the
country is so much great-
er, more diversified, and
because Washington is so
much more remote from
the places where the mon-
ey is to be spent.
