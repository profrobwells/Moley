The President's percep-
tible rise in popularity is
due to a number of circum-
stances, past and present.
So far as the immediate
situation is concerned, the
reasons are obvious. The
big Democratic majority is
caught in the net of past
pledges and future ambi-
tions. Liberal Democrats
elected in the sweep of
1058 won votes by irre-
sponsible promises.
With little regard for
what actually might be
done, they offered pana-
ceas for every ill. Fiscal
realities were ignored. If
they thought about it at
all, they assumed deficits
to be inevitable and unim-
portant.

With nothing very clear-
ly in mind, they recklessly
talked about better ways
of keeping the peace of
the world and violently
attacked the President and
Secretary Dulles.
The fact that so many
are greenhorns and of lit-
tle stature makes things
worse for their party and
their experienced leaders.
Speaker Rayburn once
said that he would much
rather have a small rather
than a large majority to
manage in the House.
Many in the majority
have real problems about
the next election. In most
cases they were elected in
marginal districts, and at
home there is a strong con-
servative and Republican
opposition whetting the ax
for 1960.
On the Senate side there
are at least four Presiden-
tial candidates-Kennedy,
Johnson, Humphrey and
Symington. Except for
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Johnson, none of these
would be contenders if
there were really notable
and commanding figures
in the party. The Demo-
cratic Party is rich in
quantity but poor in quali-
ty.

Against this inchoate
opposition the President's
situation and qualifications
stand out with great clari-
ty. He doesn't have to wor-
ry about his own future.
Moreover, in an appeal to
the public he has a vast
advantage. He is a single
figure, understandable,
able to speak for his party
with authority. He has a
national audience, at all
times. International af-
fairs, which are so critical,
permit him to have the
headlines. The opposition
is many things with many
tongues. Hence the public
is confused about what the
alternative might be.
Most important, the
President has seized an
issue that everybody can
understand: inflation. And
the people of the country
are worried. Specific pock-
ets of inflation show that
there is beginning an
ominous "flight from the
dollar"-land booms, reck-
less stock market activi-
ties by unsophisticated in-
vestors, city workers buy-
ing land in the nearby
countryside, purchases on
credit and a shift in pref-
erences in life insurance
buying.
At long last the Presi-
dent is fairly free from
the sort of advisers who
have infuriated conserva-
tives and regular Repub-
licans. Nothing so im-
paired the President in
the past as those who pro-
fessed to help him. He is
more sure of himself now.
He has been graduated
from his novitiate in poli-
tics. Now the real charac-
ter of the man is emerg-
ing from the fog of assist-
ants and advisers.
And that real character
is in the pattern of a sin-
cere, liberty-loving Ameri-
can who has a feeling for
the principles that Ameri-
cans have lived by. He
shuns the piling up of bu-
reaucracy because he has
been able to see its work-
ings at home and abroad.
He realizes that concen-
trated power in Washing-
ton is a dangerous thing.
He even feels that the ex-
cessive growth of the
President's power is not
in the American tradition.
*
He is close to the fiscal
management of the gov-
ernment and realizes how
difficult it is becoming for
the Treasury to borrow
money in the teeth of in-
creasing deficits. It is true
that he has been an ex-
pensive President, but he
has come to see the limits
of spending. And after
years of attempting to ap-
pease labor-union leaders
and ultra-liberals he re-
alizes that he can never
win them to his party.
At the moment he is
angry over the nagging
of the opposition, and that
is not hurting his popular-
ity with people who want,
enjoy and expect a show
of fire in their leaders.
A few strong vetoes will
help mightily to cement
his advantage, and from
all indications these will
be coming before long.
