Japan's Internal Security Forces
Unable to Cope With Subversion
In a previous column I
described how the new
constitution of Japan,
adopted under American
auspices, gravely weak-
ened the authority of gov-
ernment. This national
framework of government
was further weakened by
a drastic legislative reor-
ganization of Japan's po-
lice system, which, while
improved since the occu-
pation, is still unable to
meet Communist subver-
sion effectively.
The purpose of these re-
forms was to prevent the
creation of a police state.
But the result was the cre-
ation of a state without
the means for its own self-
preservation.
It should be understood
by Americans that in all
modern nations, especially
those of western continen-
tal Europe, the threat of
revolution requires a po-
lice system in large centers
such as the capital to be
under the control of the
national government.
Prior to the occupation Ja-
pan's police system was,
like those of France, Ger-
many, and Italy, responsi-
ble to the authority of the
central government.
Under the occupation, a
number of laws were an-
nulled which provided for
the maintenance of secu-
rity. This was done to
"protect individual liberty
and civil rights."
The national police sys-
tem was replaced by high-
ly decentralized systems.
Cities of 5,000 and over
had their own organiza-
tions responsible to popu-
larly elected local govern-
ments, while a national
rural police force was set
up which was independent

of the national govern-
ment. In the various local
governments there were
imposed police boards,
composed of persons who
had never been govern-
ment officials, hence with
no police experience, to
control the administrative
heads. Since Japan was al-
lowed no real military
forces, this aggregation of
wholly independent units
was responsible for coping
with emergencies.
This scattered machin-
ery for law and order sim-
ply failed to keep down
crime and unrest. There
were corrective laws in
1951, 1952, and 1954 which
measurably improved this
organization. There is a
national public safety com-
mission of five members,
only three of whom can be
of one party, appointed by
the prime minister. Under
this commission there is a
director general in Tokyo,
who has an administrative
staff with various bureaus.
The police in the various
prefectures are still under
boards. Only in a national
emergency may the prime
minister, acting for the
central government, as-
sume authority directly.
This interposition of civil-
ian boards is one of the
keys to the present weak-
ness of the system so far
as security against subver-
sion is concerned. It is as
if Congress should set up
a bipartisan board to boss
J. Edgar Hoover's FBI.
As Americans well
know, the idea of police
boards was discredited and
fell into almost general
disuse in the United States
more than half a century
ago. But under American
auspices this sort of thing
was imposed upon a coun-
try with great internal
and external threats from
communism.
Also, under existing
laws it is almost impossi-
ble for the police to deal
with gangsterism, juvenile
delinquency, and subver-
sion. To remedy this, a
new police bill was intro-
duced by the Kishi gov-
ernment in the Diet in Oc-
tober, 1958. I have care-
fully read this bill and find
no provisions which would
endanger individual rights
or lead to police oppres-
sion, since recourse can al-
ways be had to the courts.
But the radical and
Communist elements in
unions and in various sec-
tions of the heterogeneous
Socialist Party raised a
great outcry. In the course
of a month a grave threat
of'assembling a vast mob
to intimidate the Diet was
made. Disorder prevailed
in the Diet, culminating in
actual physical violence.
In the melee, the speaker
had to take to hiding, and
the prime minister found
it necessary to retire to his
own home. A recess was
declared, and the bill died.
This disorderly conduct
in the very heart of gov-
ernmental authority itself
illustrates the inadequacy
of existing laws and ad-
ministrative controls. Per-
haps after the election of
a governor of Tokyo this
month and of half of the
upper house in June, the
Liberal-Democratic Party
may be strong enough to
bring about further legis-
lation for internal security.
But at present there is al-
ways the possibility of dis-
orderly threats to national
authority.
