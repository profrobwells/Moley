THE DARK HORSE
Symington: He Looms
Large on '60 Horizon
BY RAYMOND MOLEY AND
RAYMOND MOLEY JR.
At this distant moment
there is considerable spec-
ulation that a deadlock
during the Democratic
convention next summer
is probable and that the
nomination will fall not to
the man who herds the
most delegates to Los An-
gles but to one who bides
his time and is chosen in
a compromise move by
the powers assembled.
The man most frequent-
ly mentioned as likely to
receive this tap is Sen.
Stuart Symington of Mis-
souri.
★
Of all Democrats con-
sidered to have a chance
now, Symington is per-
haps least vulnerable
when the cross fire from
the widely separated
flanks of the party is
brought to bear on the
field of hopefuls.
While he is not warmly
acceptable to any faction,
neither is he the target of
other possible candidates
at present. His is an un-
usually opportune position
for any deadlock situation.
It is also an incongruous
position.
Symington's voting rec-
ord since 1952, unlike Hu-
bert Humphrey's, has not
been marked indelibly
across the awareness of
party professionals and
voters by outbrusts and
harangues. He is not iden-
tified with the South, as
is Johnson.
That a man could com-
pile a voting record abso-
lutely in tune with the
stern score of the Ameri-
cans for Democratic Ac-
tion and yet move with
ease and acceptance
among southern conserva-
tives is a striking thing.
★
That Symington can
down a picnic lunch with
the most militant labor of-
ficials and follow it with
a dinner among leaders of
industry and business
without a touch of dis-
comfort is evidence of a
remarkable political and
gastronomical make-up.
Although he lacks imag-
ination and leadership in
the Senate, Symington of
all avowed or probable
contenders has the broad-
est practical experience.
Business decisions were
his stock in trade for many
years.
After Yale, he worked
as a molder and a drafts-
man. Then, backed by his
prosperous uncles, he
bought a clay products
factory. His was a story
of large success, demon-
strated ability, shrewd-
ness, a talent for getting
along with organized la-
bor, and a certain touch
in reviving faltering en-
terprises.
While Sens. Johnson,
Kennedy and Humphrey
have spent their public
life as legislators and can-
didates, Symington and
Stevenson have been in
the administration of gov-
ernment—Stevenson as
a state governor, Syming-
ton in a number of posi-
tions in the federal gov-
ernment tendered him by
an ex-Missouri senator,
Harry S. Truman.
★
Symington gained expe-
rience at the hands of bu-
reaucracy as surplus prop-
erty administrator, where
he remained for only a
few months in a very
sticky situation, and in a
brief stint as "clean-up
man" for RFC.
He had already made a
considerable reputation as
assistant secretary for air
and Air Force secretary.
He fought side by side
with the flying generals
and helped gain autonomy
and the lion's share of
military appropriations for
the Air Force.
This experience in a
branch of government
now deeply involved in
missiles and what Demo-
crats are certain to label
"the tardy conquest of
space" is a fortuitous
blessing for Symington.
Defense and space tech-
nology will undoubtedly
figure large in a Demo-
cratic campaign against
the Republican adminis-
tration. For 10 years Sy-
mington has been most
vocal on shortcomings in
defense.
★
He has, in fact, been
audible on little else, al-
though his voting record
is clean when scanned by
those on the left end of
the Democratic Party's
spectrum.
In the frustrating, wear-
ing hours that attend the
balloting of a deadlocked
convention, practical men
eventually get together. If
this should happen, Sy-
mington, an outstanding
vote-getter in a state that
is both North and South,
could look most attractive.
