RAYMOND MOLEY:
'Sweetheart' Laws
and Harry Bridges
As I was entering a
meeting where I was to
give a talk here in the
great harbor area of Los
Angeles, I noticed a member
of the Bridges International
Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union
passing out leaflets.
Later, I found that these
were protests against the
conduct and attitude of the
ILWU boss himself.
The rebellion of some
good Americans in the
ILWU was directed
against the resolutions
jammed through the recent
convention of the union in
Seattle where, among other
subjects, it was urged that
the United States recognize
Red China. The direct cause
of the revolt was the conduct
of Bridges in the hearings
of the House Un-American
Activities Committee, where
the ILWU boss took the 5th
Amendment.
The leaflet said, in part:
"Should we be proud of
the Seattle actions, which
go against everything
American? The rank and
file of the union ought to
vote on these resolutions
and policies. Harry should
make the first explanation."
It thus appears that a
ruthless boss, whose record
reeks with antagonism to
the government of the
United States, speaks for
thousands of American
workers without bothering
to consult their wishes,
principles or convictions.
It should be noted that
two members of the Congress
of the United States
addressed that Seattle
meeting—one a senator,
the other Delegate Burns
from Hawaii. The latter
had the effrontery to say
that the ILWU had
"brought democracy to
Hawaii."
★
The protest in the Los
Angeles Harbor area suggests
the sort of "democracy" that
prevails in the ILWU. The
whole matter also suggests
what is going to happen in
the 50th state if Burns is
elected governor in next
summer's election. That
election may well be dominated
by the concentrated political
power of the ILWU, headed
in Hawaii by Jack Hall,
whose record rivals that of
Bridges.
As the spotlight turns to
Congress, we see the travesty
of enacting labor legislation
substantially in a form wholly
acceptable to the minority
group which has had so much
to do in electing a majority
of the members of Congress.
Perhaps the Presidential
candidate in the Senate who
is sponsoring the legislation,
with the ardent support of at
least three other Presidential
candidates in that body, would
say that there are good unions
and bad unions and that in
seeking to regulate bad ones
the good ones may be injured.
★
We all would agree that
there are good unions as well
as bad ones. But we can
hardly agree that to enact a
strict set of regulations
concerning self-government in
unions could injure any good
union.
Laws are passed for the
saints as well as the sinners
among us. And while the
saints do not need policing,
they should see, and most of
us do see, that their own
safety and liberty are protected
by those laws. "Sweetheart"
legislation leaves us all at the
mercy of vicious practices.
And "us all" includes all
union members, even the
members of such an
organization as the ILWU.
★
With the potential of Joe
Curran's National Maritime
Union in alliance with the
Seafarers' International Union,
together with the longshoremen
on the East Coast and
Bridges' ILWU on the West
Coast and Hawaii—all tied
together with James Hoffa in
a transport combine—the
economy of this country could
be throttled in a week.
Is it necessary to await
complacently for this to
happen before action is taken
by Congress firmly to bring
these people within the grip
of a government elected to
protect the safety and security
of the United States?
