Rockefeller Decision to Withdraw
Was Reached After Long Thought
When the news of Nelson
Rockefeller's decision
to withdraw from the contest
for the Republican
Presidential nomination
was announced,
there were some who
sought some specific time
and spot where, with his
advisers, the governor
changed his mind about
running. A rumor gained
wide currency that it was
at a secret meeting with
his staff three days before
the announcement. This
"smoke-filled room" sort of
thinking lives on, despite
every consideration of
common sense and human
nature.
★
The better way to judge
such a decision is to start
with common sense and
the obvious facts, although
sensational news is made
by revealing what is not
obvious.
So far as the aforementioned
idea of a sudden
choice is concerned, there
is disproof of that in the
fact that a week before
the announcement a draft
of withdrawal had already
been sketched and discussed
with members of
the Rockefeller family and
old and trusted friends
thereof.
In this case, the most
sensible idea is that the
decision had been months
in the making. Back in
August, at the governors'
conference in Puerto Rico,
it was clear that the
Rockefeller hat was not
even near the ring. I sur-
mise, considering the habits
of the man, it was not
even within reach of his
hand.
His statement that he
would await the polls in
November before deciding
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
—however ill-advised so
far as dependence upon
polls was concerned—was
a means of delay while
the choices were laid end
to end in the governor's
mind and until many people
had enjoyed the privilege
of offering him advice.
The long tour of the
states was no overt hide
but a further means of informing
him about the
yeas and nays involved.
The trip did him no harm,
it provided further time
to think, and it gave his
large staff of advisers, public
relations people, and
speech writers something
to do in the interim. It is
probable that former Gov.
Dewey's advice was
sought — maybe not. At
any rate, it probably was
not a decision by Dewey.
★
It is unnecessary to go
into the details of the factors
concerned. Rockefeller's
low rating in the
polls, the polite reticence
among the leaders whom
he met on the tour, the
long and grueling campaign
which would be involved
in contesting Vice
President Nixon in the
state primaries — New
Hampshire, Wisconsin,
Oregon, and elsewhere.
It is unnecessary
to dilate on the advantage
to Rockefeller of a good
record as governor and the
winning of a re-election in
1962 in New York. There
is also the prospect of the
availability of a New York
governor possibly in 1964
and definitely in 1968.
All these considerations
must have been weighed.
But what is likely to be
overlooked is the nature
of the man, shared as it
has been by the extraordinary
life into which
he was born and in which
he has lived. A son and
grandson of very, very
rich and famous men lives
a relatively isolated life.
As a child, a boy and a
man he is a marked
and extraordinary person.
Time-servers, sycophants,
and self-servers gravitate
to him. Advice pours in,
not activated by considerations
of his welfare but
other motives.
If he is smart, as Nelson
Rockefeller clearly is, he
will learn to rate those who
come in contact with him.
He will know whose advice,
in his private business
and public affairs,
had proved most reliable
in the hindsight of the
events. His circle of inti-
mates grows smaller and
smaller, although his contacts
are innumerable. He
learns to evaluate those
who work for him and to
know what they know and
do that, in a limited field,
is important to him.
★
It is not a free life. He
is not lucky, but in many
cases unlucky. A young
rich man may want to be
an engineer, or a writer,
or a doctor, or a lawyer.
But the crushing load of
responsibility for the administration
of vast properties
shuts off the happier
destiny. If he has
character, as all the Rockefeller
grandsons have, he
accepts the family responsibility
and makes what
he can of it.
All this must be considered
in determining this
momentous choice. At a
distance, it seems to be a
very wise choice indeed.
