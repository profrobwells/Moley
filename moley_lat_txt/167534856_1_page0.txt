George Meany cannot
be accused of stupidity in
politics. The number of
senators and representa-
tives he and Walter. Reu-
ther have elected proves
the power of his political
machine. the Committee
on Political Education.
But like many politicians,
he adapts his line of ar-
gument to fit the occasion
and ignores the gentle vir-
tue of consistency.
*
Speaking last week be-
fore the delegates of the
International Ladies Gar-
ment Workers Union in
Miami, he hurled a chal-
lenge. at those business-
men who have decided to
urge political action by
their employees:
"Business is going to go
into politics now because
of the threat of big labor
. . . and when they get
down to that contest be-
tween, workers and big
business, we will do all
right because there are a
little more of us than of
them . . . we are doing
more of it and getting bet-
ter and better results. We
shall be as political as the
times and necessity call
for."
This is the same George
Meany who was testifying
back in March before the
House Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. At that
time he said, according to
the official record:
"The political power of
the unions is bunk . . .
union leaders don't control
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
any votes and don't have
any political power at all."
When a member of the
committee asked about
the money they admitted
spending in elections, he
said:
"That money is for the
purpose of seeing that
they get to the ballot box
and that they are thor-
oughly informed about
the issues. We spend
a lot of money trying to
induce them to register
and vote."
With reference to the
publication that is distrib-
uted before congressional
elections which specifical-
ly gives the opinion of the
union leaders about every
senator's and representa-
tive's voting record and
which is the most direct
sort of propaganda for and
against the candidates
they are supporting or op-
posing. Meany said that
this is "to give them in-
formation."
*
Although Mr. Meany
was fooling no one, who
is acquainted with politics
when he said he was not
engaging in political activ-
ity, it must be remem-
bered that a great many
people are not acquainted
with politics.
His denial before the
House committee is in
line with the smartest of
political jargon. No expe-
rienced politician will
ever claim great influence
except to his followers,
and when he is address-
ing them he conveys the
idea that "they" or "the
party" is going to win. To
others, he denies any
great influence.
So, in spite of the
Meany contradiction, he is
showing political acumen.
But in what he said in
Miami he not only misin-
terprets the reviving in-
terest of businessmen in
politics but invites a class
conflict which would be
fought to the grave injury
of the vast majority who
are neither in organized
labor nor at the top of big
or little businesses.
*
The reviving interest of
businessmen is and should
be directed to helping the
great unorganized people
in the middle to become
active in politics for their
own sake, not.for business
or any other special inter-
est.
If a business enters pol-
itics only to oppose labor
unions, it will meet with
frustration and grave
damage to itself and all
the rest of us.
So far as the Meany
statements are concerned,
the Miami admission is
correct, not what he said
before the House commit-
tee. I know of no defini-
tion of politics to which
the activities of the COPE
do not conform. To call
it education is, to use Mr.
Meany's own term,
"bunk."
