Problems of the Elderly: Forced
Retirement, the Inflationary Spiral
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If some politicians have
their way, the song of the
inimitable oldster, Mau-
rice Chevalier, "I'm Glad
I'm Not Young Any More,"
may become our national
anthem. At any rate, 15½
million of us may catch
the refrain.
Since 1900 our popula-
tion has more than dou-
bled, but those over 65
have increased five times.
Whole new professions
have grown up dedicated
to ministering to these
people. They specialize
not only in the illnesses
that prevail among older
people, but in their eco-
nomic, emotional, housing,
recreational, and "adjust-
ment" problems. Special
attention is given in uni-
versity courses, the plans
of labor unions, and in
government at all levels.

A Senate subcommittee
chaired by Sen. McNa-
mara and manned by
Messrs. Kennedy, Clark,
and Randolph, Democrats,
and Republicans Dirksen
and Goldwater is called
the subcommittee on prob-
lems of the aged and ag-
ing. It has held long hear-
ings in June and August
and plans to take to the
road after Congress ad-
journs. No doubt it will
wind up in Florida as soon
as the tourist season opens
there.
Significantly, the word-
ing of its purpose says
that it should find "the ex-
tent to which additional
federal programs should
be undertaken," etc.
Some startling matters
have come to light in this
investigation, such as that
"most of the aged have
low incomes." It might be
noted that this "problem"
affects almost everybody
in these days of high taxes
and inflation. Also, this
shocker: "Most aged per-
sons are not working,"
which might not be re-
garded as a "problem" by
most of us.
There are other facts in
the subcommittee's rec-
ord that are not quite so
obvious: About six in 10
of the old people were get-
ting Social Security bene-
fits in June, 1958; one in
six were getting old age
assistance; the average old-
age benefit is $72 a month;
about 600,000 of the elder-
ly are receiving old age as-
sistance in addition to old
age insurance; old people
use more hospital care,
and the costs of this are
rising.
*
The subcommittee has
heard various witnesses
argue for much more
housing for the aged and
more nursing homes. Also,
it has heard strenuous ob-
jections to compulsory re-
tirement and pleas for a
law against such discrimi-
nation.
Since this subcommittee
is an offshoot of the Senate
Committee on Labor and
Welfare and its chairman,
Sen. McNamara, was elect-
ed by the powerful ma-
chine of the UAW, it might
be appropriate to study
how much the spiral of
wages has participated in
the dropping of older
workers in industry. It is
true that employers have
done the dropping, but to
what extent has that been
compelled by union de-
mands imposed upon in-
dustry? The growth of
compulsory retirement has
a distinct relationship to
the high fringe and 'wel-
fare benefits imposed in
collective bargaining upon
employers.
So far as white collar
workers who are not
unionized are concerned,
compulsory retirement is a
subject which should be
reconsidered seriously by
employers. The automatic
dropping of able-bodied
workers at an age which
was determined long ago
when health and longevity
were quite different mat-
ters is an injustice which
should be corrected. It is,
however, hardly subject
to the general terms of a
"law."
The business of "retrain-
ing" people is, to my mind,
of very limited applicabili-
ty. In a free society people
need some encouragement
to save and provide for
their own years after re-
tirement. They should not
be restricted to income
from Social Security and
limited earnings, but
should be permitted to
earn more by their own
efforts without losing
their rights under that
system.
*
It seems to me that
there are two other com-
mittees of the Senate
which have more to con-
tribute to the "problems"
of the aged and aging
than Sen. McNamara's.
These are the committees
on appropriations and fi-
nance. They are concerned
with inflation, and their
objective should be a
sound dollar. It isn't more
"programs" that the re-
tired need as much as the
preservation of their right
to expect that what they
save and what they will
get from Social Security
will be redeemed in goods
of an amount and quality
equal to what they could
buy when their dollars
were saved. With that
sort of assurance, a good
deal of the "problem"
will be solved by individ-
ual freedom of choice.
