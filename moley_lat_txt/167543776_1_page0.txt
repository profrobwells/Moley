RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Hopeful Humphrey
Faces Some Hurdles
WITH RAYMOND MOLEY JR.
The ebullient Mr. Khru-
shchev has verbally rid-
died many targets and
persons in his long politi-
cal career. However, one
man is said to have out-
talked him on one occa-
sion.
That man is Hubert
Humphrey, senator from
Minnesota, one of several
Democratic hopefuls for
the 1960 nomination. Last
year, after an 8-hour talk-
athon with the Soviet pre-
mier, Humphrey emerged
with undaunted mien.
"Khrushchev probably
made a tactical error," a
reporter who knows
Humphrey of old ob-
served. "He probably be-
gan by asking Hubert a
question. Eight hours lat-
er he had his answer,
complete with historical
background, statistics, and
some good reasons why he
should always support the
Democratic Party."
*
It has been Humphrey's
fast, glib, and wide-rang-
ing tongue which has tak-
en him from obscurity in
his father's Huron (S.D.)
drugstore to political sci-
ence teaching at MacAles-
ter College in St. Paul, to
the office of mayor of Min-
neapolis (where he set a
record of sorts by deliver-
ing 2,000 orations in two
years), and on to the U.S.
Senate.
The senator's endow-
ment may prove his great-
est obstacle in his long-
winded bid for the 1960
nomination. Even his
fondest admirers admit
that Humphrey talks too
much, soars into unfamil-
iar realms, and is careless
with facts.
In his favor, Humphrey
possesses unques-
tioned endurance and, it
must be emphasized, a
grasp of practical politics.
He sees to it that the lit-
tle things that figure big
in political practice are
done. Even more than
Gov. Mennen Williams,
who neglects his job to go
around "meeting people"
in Michigan, Humphrey
strives to make himself
known and heard.
*
He is forever returning
to the source of his
strength his constitu-
ents and political work-
ers telling them that
he, of all their elected
representatives, lo-
cal, state or national, can
best serve their interests,
however trifling.
By defeating Republi-
can Joseph H. Ball in
1948, he had first to car-
ry out a very shrewd po-
litical maneuver of weld-
ing the backing of the
Democratic Party to that
of the Farm-Labor Party.
His achievement made
him the first Democratic
senator from Minnesota in
years and was certainly
partly responsible for Mr.
Truman's carrying the
state against Thomas E.
Dewey.
*
Among Presidential as-
pirants, Humphrey and
Sen. John Kennedy are
ideologically farthest to
the left. Their records
and close intellectual
proximity with Americans
for Democratic Action and
the Committee on Politi-
cal Education, the political
arm of organized labor,
mark them as of the same
extreme leanings. Hum-
phrey has been a leading
official in ADA and has the
warm assurances of Elea-
nor Roosevelt.
Although labor has
gained enormously in its
influence in Democratic
councils and its views are
shared by a majority of
Democratic senators and
representatives, its lead-
ers must recognize the
importance of southern
support in the election of
a President.
Humphrey, who was de-
nied labor support for the
Vice Presidential spot in
1956 and cried, "I don't
know anyone who deserves
their support more than I
do," also knows the im-
portance of southern ap-
proval.
*
But southern accept-
ance of Humphrey would
be strange to imagine. His
speech for an unaccept-
able civil rights plank in
the 1948 convention,
which triggered a south-
ern "revolt," cannot now
be rubbed out with soft
talk. Of equal importance,
the conservative core of
the Democratic Party in
both House and Senate,
while in a minority, hails
from southern states.
Those who have been
subjected to the Hum-
phrey oratory over the
years carry an indelible
impression of him as a
"wild-eyed" liberal toting
a double-barreled weapon
leveled at their essential
conservatism-greater fed-
eral assumption of gov-
ernmental matters at
state and local levels.
Hubert Humphrey has
been running the long race
for some time now, and it
will be interesting to see
how the breathless senator
hopes to clear the hurdles
that loom ahead.
