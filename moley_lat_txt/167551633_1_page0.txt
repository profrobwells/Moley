Some Problems in the Candidacy
of a Catholic for the Presidency
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems to most rea-
sonable people that Presi-
dent Eisenhower has
made the most sensible
suggestion about the in-
vasion of some foreign
lands by hordes of new
babies.
His idea is that the dis-
tribution of information
and the means of control-
ling the size of families
should be the responsibil-
ity of private organiza-
tions. The government, he
holds, is certainly not the
agency to use such a
purpose.
The United States has
many private organiza-
tions and agencies dedi-
cated to the welfare of
heathen lands. No nation
except medieval Islam has
had so ardent a zeal for
reforming other people.
Those organizations have
money and personnel for
the purpose.

To use government for
such a purpose, which
mingles religious, racial,
and other emotional con-
cerns, would be the worst
of all perversions of tax
money.
Despite the President's
statement, the controversy
goes on, with a serious
impact on Presidential
candidates, especially on
Sen. John Kennedy.
It is not clear which
side started the fuss. A
latent feeling among
many Protestant divines
that a Catholic should not
be President has been
fanned into a flame. And
members of the Roman
Catholic clergy have firm-
ly stated the position of
their church against the
dissemination of such in-
formation and especially
against the use of govern-
ment money for such a
purpose.
Some have also gone so
far as to say that a Catho-
lic President should veto
any measure requiring
any such action by a gov-
ernment agency.
There are many Catho-
lics—and I am not sug-
gesting that this includes
the members of the
clergy who have been vo-
cal on the subject—who
sincerely believe that, de-
spite the injustice to Sen.
Kennedy, it would serve
the interests of amity
among religious groups if
a Catholic were not a can-
didate.

The ignition of the old
fire which burned so
fiercely when Gov. Alfred
E. Smith ran for the
Presidency has had a pro-
found effect upon Demo-
cratic political leaders. A
correspondent in the Mid-
dle West who interviewed
some of them reports
grave concern.
One of those leaders,
who will have a good deal
to do with the selection
of the Democratic candi-
date next summer, said:
"I have not the slight-
est doubt in my own mind
that Jack Kennedy will
not allow anything to
come between him and
what is best for his coun-
try. The average voter
will not look at the prob-
lem in that way. And so
I say, 'Why borrow trou-
ble?'"
"If Kennedy is the can-
didate, we are in for a
vicious campaign that
could destroy the entire
Democratic Party."
Another professional
said practically the same
thing.
The commotion raised
by Bishop Pike and some
other non-Catholic clergy-
men is unjustified on two
grounds. The dissemina-
tion of birth-control in-
formation is something
which would launch their
own nation and govern-
ment into new tensions
with other countries and
with many religious bod-
ies abroad.
It would entangle civil
and religious functions
and thus impair the sepa-
ration of church and state.
Moreover, these advocates
of government action
arouse a wholly unneces-
sary religious passion in
our country, which has
come a far way from the
days of the APA in the
1890s and the KKK in the
1920s.

A businessman in the
Midwest, commenting on
the controversy, regrets
the whole thing: "I would
rather oppose Kennedy on
his record, not upon the
fact of his religion. The
welfare of the nation
would be suborned to a
religious issue. It is un-
American."
I agree with this gen-
tleman. This is something
that goes far beyond its
impact on Kennedy. It
says to every young man
who has a laudable ambi-
tion to serve his country
that in the clutch his des-
tiny will be determined
by blind, irrational preju-
dice.
