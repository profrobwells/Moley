RAYMOND MOLEY:
Connally Amendment
an Emotional Issue
There is an old saying,
attributed to former Sen.
Ashurst of Arizona, that
when a senator changes
his mind he doesn't see the
light, he feels the heat.
Certainly that applies to
the action of the Senate
Foreign Relations Commit-
tee when it dropped the
Humphrey proposal re-
pealing the veto power of
the United States over
cases coming before the
World Court (the Connally
amendment).
In this instance, as in
that of the Bricker amend-
ment, the President had
apparently yielded to the
State Department's peren-
nial yearning to sacrifice
American sovereignty to
appease various and sun-
dry foreign nations.
*
It is remarkable that an
issue which presents such
rather complicated mat-
ters of international law
and practice should have
caught the public interest
so fast and so strongly.
This is written after two
weeks in Arizona and in
Northern and Southern
California. I have talked
with many people about
this issue out here, and
there has been tremendous
concern about it. The fact
is that a very considerable
opposition to the President
and the Vice President
was gathering rapidly
among Republicans.
If the matter had been
pressed, it might well have
become a major issue in
the campaign and have se-
riously injured Nixon's
strength even in his home
state.
The Connally amend-
ment is, like the Bricker
amendment six years ago,
a highly emotional issue.
Women especially were
genuinely aroused this
year, as in 1954.
*
It is not without signifi-
cance that the opposition
of the President and Sec-
retary Dulles to the Brick-
er amendment and its de-
feat by one vote in the
Senate were followed by a
disastrous Republican de-
feat in the congressional
elections in that year. His-
tory might well have re-
peated itself in 1960.
It is not clear whether
Sen. Hubert Humphrey in-
troduced his controversial
resolution as a means of
opening a fatal split in the
Republican Party or be-
cause he is so imbued with
one-worldism. But if it was
the former motive, it was
infernally clever politics.
In the hearings on the
Humphrey proposal before
the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, Sen. Ful-
bright exercised a high
hand, excluding many
messages and letters in op-
position, including a re-
luctance to take note of a
letter from former Sen.
Connally himself. Some
pretty flimsy arguments
were advanced in favor of
the proposal.
*
One was the naive sug-
gestion that no real do-
mestic issues were likely
to be brought before the
court in any event. This
ignored the fact that the
various committees and
commissions of the United
Nations already have
drawn up all sorts of pro-
posals for meddling in the
domestic affairs of mem-
ber countries.
Another more complex
but equally naive argu-
ment has been that we al-
ready have a sort of inter-
national common law,
which would prevail in all
activities of the court. This
so-called common law is
what is known as interna-
tional law.
Anyone who has studied
international law knows
that it is only a very
vague and tentative mass
of customs and practices,
and whenever a nation
considers its vital interests
at stake it has been violat-
ed with impunity. Indeed,
the "father" of internation-
al law was Hugo Grotius;
whose great preachments
were written in fairly mod-
ern times.
*
On the other hand, An-
glo-American common law
is centuries old. Its origins
go far back into the mists
of antiquity. It is the em-
bodiment of concepts of
right and equity which
have been accepted by the
overwhelming majority of
those who live under it
and by it.
Superficial people have
the notion that merely
passing a law by a legisla-
tive majority carries with
it the power of strict en-
forcement. But no law
which has only the accept-
ance of a mere majority
can be enforced. We should
have learned that lesson
from our experience with
prohibition.
Any workable interna-
tional common law will be
centuries in the making.
Until then, the United
States should carefully
guard its sovereign rights
in its internal affairs.
