RAYMOND MOLEY:
Why Not Stevenson?
---Democrats Asking
WITH RAYMOND MOLEY JR.
With the probability of a
hard-hitting campaign in
1960, many Democratic
Party professionals, after
appraising the liabilities
of Johnson, Kennedy,
Humphrey and Symington,
are asking: "Why not
Stevenson?"
They clearly realize that
there is more force in the
"not" than in the "why."
For here, too, there are
liabilities, revealed in the
blazing light of two campaigns.
But, it is reasoned,
with no internationally renowned
war hero running
this time, the virtues obscured
in the Eisenhower
crusade will appear in a
more appealing light.
Perhaps they will, for
there are indubitable virtues.
Adlai Stevenson has
a fine intelligence and
great sensitivity to the
persistence of certain public
problems. He has a
mentality that seeks nothing
but the best. This is
especially true of his
greatest concern, for the
English language. In the
rough-house of his two
campaigns he lost valuable
time and energy in seeking
perfection in what he
was to say. This was the
despair of more practical
people, who saw votes to
be got by warm personal
contacts.
★
He sees the dreadful
forces that threaten the
peace of the world and
clearly appreciates how
much better it would be
to have mutual respect and
order among nations. At
home, he realizes how
much better we might all
live with less selfishness,
class interest, and political
duplicity. But when
he comes to grips with solutions,
there is lack of
driving belief in remedies,
and in his prescriptions he
has tended either to generalize
or to accept un-
critically the proposals,
mostly outdated, that the
"intellectuals" around him
provide.
Stevenson's conduct as
a defeated, titular head of
a party has been exemplary.
As a gentleman in
semiretirement he has
made a fair number of appearances,
speaking loyally
at party conclaves, and
helping as he could to
raise money and enthusiasm.
Certainly he has
made no enemies, either
for himself or his party.
But his fastidiousness,
his search for the ultimate
best, have enclosed the man
of action in a pale prison
of reflection. When a man
of Stevenson's endowments
and attractiveness
is thus confined, he is too
often subjected to the
great gravitational forces
in the life about him. Because
of his distinguished
grandfather's name which
he bears and his fortunate
security from material
need, he has been in exalted
political company all
his life. His quick conscience
always impelled
him to be of service in
public causes. Hence, a
career which cannot inappropriately
be called drifting.
Family considerations
impelled him to law and,
since there was to be nothing
but the best, he attended
the Harvard Law
School. He did not finish
the course and went back
to Illinois, tending to his
family's affairs. When the
New Deal blazed into national
note, George Peek,
an Illinois Republican,
called him to the new agriculture
setup as a lawyer.
Nothing could be
more incongruous than
this sensitive young scholar
in the company of hard-
headed zealots who had
over-run the scene. Another
strong man, Frank
Knox, called him to Washington
in the Navy Department
during the war.
Finally, although he wanted
to run for senator, the
realists pushed him into
the governorship of his
state. The greatest of realists,
Jake Arvey, sensed
him as a Presidential candidate,
and here Stevenson,
according to his own
words, played a role for
which neither his nature
nor his experience
equipped him.
★
As the president of a
college, he might have
been more happy and distinguished,
or as an author
or professor of English.
But again, tremendous
circumstances, in which a
candidate is created when
those who actively aspire
are barred for one reason
or another, may draw this
self-styled "uneasy politician"
into another campaign.
It may well be more
strenuous than either of
the two in which he had
the misfortune to participate.
