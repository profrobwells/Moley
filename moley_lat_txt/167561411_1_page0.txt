RAYMOND MOLEY:
Kennedy Could Lose
Support of Unions
WITH RAYMOND MOLEY JR.
"My only comment, sen-
ator," snapped AFL-CIO
President George Meany,
"God save us from our
friends."
Quietly, Sen. John F.
Kennedy replied: "I say
that, too, Mr. Meany."
This exchange occurred
when the 1959 labor legis-
lation was nearing pas-
sage. Meany's remark fol-
lowed a statement by Ken-
nedy that the bills were
prepared by competent
lawyers who were friends
of labor. Kennedy's reply
to Meany reflects a bit of
realism which he appreci-
ates more clearly than his
enthusiastic support-
ers. He realizes that his
apparent advantages-the
support of powerful poli-
ticians over the nation,
his attractiveness as a per-
son, his energy and native
ability, and his eminence
in public opinion polls-
may prove wholly ephem-
eral. Nothing under the
blue reaches of heaven is
more perishable than a
man of the hour.

Months, even years of
work, a considerable ex-
penditure of money, and
marked qualifications-all
may in a race for the nomi-
nation be swept aside in a
moment, at any time from
now to the final hour of
the convention. Kennedy's
intense realism-a herit-
age from his grandfather,
Patrick, ward leader in
Boston, and from his fa-
ther, Joseph-and the wis-
dom born of his voracious
reading of history have
prepared him for whatever
may happen.
In the months ahead,
support which is now con-
sidered Kennedy's may
dissipate or fail to be effec-
tive. Labor, for example,
bitterly resents his coura-
geous stand in agreeing to
the strong labor bill in the
House-Senate conference.
The men who dispense the
union's largess are not
conspicuous for tolerance.
Any beneficiary who devi-
ates from the ideological
line of those bosses is au-
tomatically convicted of
treachery. Kennedy's
crime seems to be that he
followed the only line pos-
sible if there were to be a
labor bill at all,
Hard-bitten delegates
may weigh the fact that
Kennedy is a Roman Cath-
olic and as such might stir
the embers among the in-
tolerant. Such delegates as
would be influenced by
that have no personal bias.
They favor not the man
who has the most assets,
but the one who has few-
er liabilities, however un-
fortunate the roots of
such political disadvan-
tages may be.

A faction of the party
in which Eleanor Roose-
velt operates opposes Ken-
nedy. Mrs. Roosevelt's op-
position has little to do
with the man's capacity.
It is no credit to her, since
it is directed toward Ken-
nedy's father and per-
tains to events a quarter
of a century ago.
Conservatives in the
Democratic Party eye with
suspicion Kennedy's vot-
ing record, which almost
without deviation has met
the standards of the AFL-
CIO COPE. His record
jibes in almost every es-
sential with the specifica-
tions of the Americans for
Democratic Action. This is
not without importance to
the conservatives in his
party.
It would be a strain on
credulity to accept Ken-
nedy as a "moderate"-a
term his supporters use
along with "friend of la-
bor." His recent remarks
in Ohio underline his dem-
onstrated faith: greater
New Deal spending, and
greater concentration of
power in the federal gov-
ernment and in the office
of President. Such power
must be gained by still
more greatly reducing the
realm of state and local
government.

But the attractive young
man from Massachusetts
has been doing on a na-
tional scale the same work
that proved so effective in
beating Henry Cabot
Lodge in 1952 and which
enabled him to wrest con-
trol of his state's organiza-
tion. He cannot be dis-
counted as a contender.
These effective methods
may win again.
