U.S.-Housing Handouts Creating
New Class of Rich From the Idle
Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Anderson,
who is rapidly becoming
the chief exponent of common
sense in the Washington
administration, is
mainly concerned, he says,
with "sustainable economic
growth — not just any
kind of growth — as the
major goal of economic
policy."
We may assume from
what he has said on other
occasions that "just any
kind of growth" would include
huge federal handouts
for housing developments
in cities, with all the
inflationary consequences
attendant on that short
cut to prosperity.
For housing — residential
and business — is a major
bulwark of our economy.

To anyone who chooses
to look at the facts, it is
apparent that lavish federal
expenditures are creating
a new class of rich
people who have done
nothing, but whose ownership
of land is inactive or
speculative. A new wealth
consisting of unearned
profits is appearing at
every spot where federal
money is flowing into public
works, urban development,
highways and many
water conservation projects.
Henry George's fame
over the world in the last
two decades of the 19th
century was as great as is
that of John Maynard
Keynes now. His basic
philosophy held that equity
demanded the taxing of
the "unearned increment"
on land values and, as he
said, taxes should "bear
as lightly as possible on

production" and "bear
equally, so as to give no
one an advantage or put
anyone at a disadvantage
as compared with others."
Those principles, first
stated by Adam Smith in
1776, are true today and
apply with great pertinence
to urban development.
The magazine House
and Home recently sponsored
a round-table conference
on housing and urban
development generally.
Participating were representatives
of the housing, real estate,
insurance, mortgage, banking,
and savings and loan businesses.
P. I. Prentice, editor
and publisher of House
and Home, was moderator.
The report agreed upon by
all centered upon "tight
money" and also inflationary
land values.
The report had this to
say about the latter problem:
"Steepest price inflation
of all has been the price
inflation in land...the
builders know all too well
what is happening, because
the price of the land
they need has risen far
faster than the price of the
materials they buy or the
wages of the labor they
employ.
★
"The price of big city
slum land has soared so
high that private enterprise
cannot meet the need
for low-income or even
middle-income housing
without a big land-write-down
subsidy. The price
of suburban land has soared
so high that in some
projects the land seller
gets almost as many
dollars for his acreage as
all the manufacturers get
for all the building products
used in the houses...
"The only way land
price inflation can be prevented
is to tax land much
more heavily, shifting a
substantial part of the local
tax burden now carried
by improvements to the
land itself. Taxes are the
only important costs a
land speculator must pay,
so taxes are the only brake
on the price of land...
★
"Incidentally, taxing
land more heavily would
take the bootleg profit out
of slums and force many
slumlords to improve their
property to get enough
added income to pay their
added taxes. It would deflate
the bootleg value of slum
property and make federal
subsidies for urban renewal
land-write-downs unnecessary.
It would cut the cost
of highway extension by
cutting land costs for the
right of way.
"It would make the unearned
increment in suburban
land values pay the cost
of schools and other community
facilities needed to convert
raw land into housing. It
would let home builders
offer better homes for less
money by spending for
quality the money they now
waste on land inflation.
It would reduce taxes on
good homes by increasing
the taxes on vacant and
under-used land."

the round-table discussion
appears in the current issue
of House and Home.
