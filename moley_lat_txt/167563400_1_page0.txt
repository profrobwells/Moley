Politicians in Congress
are quite aware of the
growing number of senior
citizens and. eye their
votes with increasing con-
cern. Some senators are
making a specialty of this
concern and are readying
bills of all kinds for vari-
ous federal benefits.
But while such poli-
ticians are accurate in rec-
ognizing the political po-
tential of these voters,
they assume all too glibly
that the only concern of a
person over 65 is to get
handouts from the govern-
ment.
★
The fact can easily be
proved that a major pro-
portion of those over 65
neither are in need of nor
want support by the gov-
ernment. A realistic politi-
cal leader, such as a can-
didate for President,
would appeal to that ma-
jority. They are more in-
terested in conserving
what they have than in
getting something for
nothing.
The stereotype of the
so-called problem of the
aged, duly shown last
week on the cover of a
magazine, is a group of
elderly, stupid-looking
gents drowsing on a
bench and playing at
horseshoes in the Florida
sun. This is a quite false
representation of the 16
million Americans over 65.
A true portrayal could
be approached by a com-
pilation of the property in-
terests of the 16 million,
together with a considera-
tion of values wasted in
our system which denies
useful work to so many
who are perfectly able to
make a great contribution
to the nation's welfare.

As Dr. Edward L. Bortz
told a congressional com-
mittee last year, people
not only are living long-
er, but are staying young
longer. He said: "A curi-
ous paradox faces society
today... people are liv-
ing longer. At the same
time, outmoded practices
on the part of industry,
labor, government are
forcing large groups out of
useful occupations.
"This is taking place at
a time when through
years of practice, study,
knowledge and experi-
ence, an individual is ca-
pable of the best perform-
ance of his entire life.
Certainly the solvent old-
er individual who is a con-
tributing rather than a
noncontributing member
of the community is an as-
set of first importance."
We should consider the
distinction between mere
age and disability. Gov-
ernment and private wel-
fare can and should pro-
vide for the genuinely dis-
abled and the utterly in-
competent. But a greater
and greater proportion of
those past 60 are not dis-
abled or incompetent.
They are being forced
by labor contracts into
early retirement. Corpora-
tion and other employers
insist upon, arbitrary re-
tirement at an age limit
which was created in the
distant past. In some lines
such as advertising sales-
manship and newspaper-
ing, it is getting harder
and harder for a man over
50 to get a new job.
★
It is true that a power-
ful political case against
inflation could be made by
showing the purely mate-
rial interests of retired or
semi-retired people. But
there are values other
than the material to sup-
port such ar. appeal.
One of the most terrible
tolls taken is the destruc-
tion of the happiness and
usefulness of people who
are told by society that
they are dispensable
when, in fact, they are
probably abler, wiser, and
more capable of productiv-
ity than ever before. The
best appeal to senior citi-
zens must not be limited
to saving their savings
but to helping them save
themselves.
The voting potential of
the 16 million past 65 is,
allowing for some overlap-
ping, greater than that of
the farmers and almost as
great as that of union
members. But they lack
organization. Perhaps they
will never be organized.
★
But they could be sum-
moned to political action
by real political leader-
ship. They have what is
indispensable for political
action time on their
hands and a capacity for
organization and persua-
sion. They have not only
their own votes but the
capacity to mobilize oth-
ers.
Their interests as well
as the interests of the na-
tion in sound money and
solvency can be furthered
by their efforts. They are
a massive political poten-
tial, waiting for real lead-
ership.
