RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Politics Behind
the 'Oil Trust' Suits
Some of us will remem-
ber the sultry, sluggish
political atmosphere back
in August, 1952. Gen. Ei-
senhower had been nomi-
nated for President and
was reposing in the
Brown Palace Hotel in
Denver, wondering what
a candidate's duties were.
Around him were
Sherman Adams and a lot
of amateurs, who also
were at a loss as to what
to do with a nomination
after they had won it.
The campaign, as a news-
paperman remarked, was
"running like a dry
creek." The public only
knew that the general
had won a famous victory.
★
The Truman adminis-
tration's quest for anoth-
er famous victory, in Ko-
rea, was fizzling out. And
the practical politician in
the White House knew
that his party was in trou-
ble, despite its greenhorn
opposition. He had an en-
emy by the pigtail in Ko-
rea, and the strong smell
of a mess in Washington
in his perceptive nostrils.
Also, he realized shrewd-
ly that the candidate of
his party, with all his
quips and quiddities, was
no world-beater.
The decision made in
Washington then was to
bring out the old props
for a dramatic assault
upon the "oil trust." This
had been stand-by routine
ever since William Jen-
nings Bryan.
A complaint was filed
by the attorney general
against the Socony Mobil
Oil Co., asserting that the
"Octopus" had
over-
charged the U.S. govern-
ment for Middle East oil
in the operations of that
proud achievement of the
Truman administration,
the Marshall Plan.

The suit sought a re-
fund of the entire amount
paid for the crude oil,
which it stated was $49
million or alternatively
the alleged overcharge,
which was claimed to be
$28 million.
A goodly proportion of
the press severely criti-
cized this action as with-
out merit and politically
inspired. But President
Truman regarded such
criticism with scorn ap-
propriate to his designa-
tion of the newspapers as
the hirelings of big busi-
ness.
Columnists and orators
favorable to the Truman
administration hailed the
complaint, together with
an accompanying grand
jury probe of other compr-
nies, with acclaim. One
writer, whose memory
went back to the days
when attacks on the Stand-
ard Oil trust were peren-
nials in political cam-
paigns, predicted that "big
oil" would be the major is-
sue in the campaign.
The case, however, lin-
gered on. The new Presi-
dent's attorney general,
who had been a major po-
litical operator in the Ei-
senhower campaign for
the nomination, permitted
the complaint to remain.
There seemed to be no rea-
son to stir up the animals
by dismissing it and thus
give Democrats a chance
to attack the administra-
tion's friendship for big
business.
In 1957, another oil com-
pany facing substantially
the same charge won its
case, first in the District
Court of Appeals by a
unanimous decision.
★
Finally, late last Decem-
ber, when the populace
was likely to be more con-
cerned with Christmas
and New Year's festivities
and with traffic jams than
with courts and politics,
the Justice Department
decided not to bring the
complaint against Socony
Mobil to trial and quietly
dismissed it.
This episode has certain
implications. Two succes-
sive administrations must
bear almost equal blame:
The Truman administra-
tion for initiating such an
insubstantial charge in a
political campaign and the
Eisenhower administra-
tion for permitting seven
long years to pass before
dismissing it.
My conviction is that
politics, rather than any
firm helief in the justice of
the charge, ruled in both
cases. If one wants to be
charitable, he is free to at-
tribute the long delay to
the messy bureaucracy
which prevails in the De-
partment of Justice.
★
But however we judge
it, the matter has cost the
taxpayers and the consum-
ers of oil tens of thou-
sands of dollars without
good and substantial justi-
fication. Nobody but law-
vers and politicians has
profited.
The high cost of politics
is not all recorded in cam-
paign contributions. Much
more is involved in such
cases as this.
