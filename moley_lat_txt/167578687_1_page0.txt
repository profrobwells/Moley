Sen. Kennedy's Classification
of Presidents Ignores History
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a recent speech before that Washingtonian
"House of Intellect," the
National Press Club, Sen.
John F. Kennedy reopened the old academic
game of classifying Presidents as "strong" and
"weak."
There was plenty of
quibbling on that subject
before the senator saw
the light of day. I started
to teach political science
in a university the year
before Kennedy was born,
and my expositions were
full of the accepted platitudes, which I regret.
That was before I knew
something about real
Presidents, rather than
Presidents in books.
As examples of "strong"
Presidents, Kennedy mentioned first Franklin D.
Roosevelt, then Jackson,
Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt,
Wilson and Truman. This
is the mythology prevalent in academic circles
today.

I suspect the hand of
certain academicians in
the senator's speech. In
any event, the theory
runs parallel with the political historiology of Prof.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., biographer of Jackson and
F. D. R.
My suspicion is invigorated by the significant
sentence: "He (the next
President) must reopen
the channels of communication between the world
of thought and the seat of
power."
If this means anything,
it says that the turnpike
should be opened between
the senator's alma mater,
Harvard, and the White
House. That highway was
well traveled in the early
days of F. D. R. That indefatigable recruiter of
Harvard talent, Prof. Felix Frankfurter, commuted
thereon. And loads of
one-way riders moved
from the "world of
thought" to Washington.
Many are still there. Two
notable ones are brain-
trusting for Sen. Lyndon
Johnson.

Perhaps there was a
good reason for the omission of that incomparable
table-thumper and chauvinist, James K. Polk, who
was elected on the indefensible challenge to England, "54-40 or fight." If
we had made good on
that, and had England
yielded, the United States
would now have senators
from the richest part of
British Columbia.
But having been elected, Polk turned south and,
in a war later denounced
by Lincoln and Grant as
unwarranted (Woodrow
Wilson called it "inexcusable aggression"), tore
away the greater part of
Mexico.
Perhaps Kennedy's
omission was due to the
fact that Polk defeated a
senator, Henry Clay, who
was selected by Kennedy
himself a few years ago
as one of the five greatest. Clay's three defeats
established the tradition
that senators are not very
good candidates for President.
The fallacy in this common classification of Presidents as "strong" and
"weak" is that it identifies noise, publicity and
table-thumping with
achievement. In this sophomoric category, William
H. Taft and William McKinley are called "weak."
But let us see.
McKinley was the gentlest and most patient of
men. But his vision of
American interests moved
our defenses westward,
first to Hawaii and then
to a self-governing ally in
the Philippines. He held
off war with Spain until
Congress was ready to declare, with or without
Presidential approval.
But once over, his
terms of peace provided
for the protection of
American interests to the
south and far east. With
his great secretary of
state, through the "open
door" policy, he prevented
the partition of China
by rapacious European
powers. At home he restored the confidence
which brought prosperity
to farms and jobs to workers.

After nearly eight years
of T. R.'s shouting about
trusts and evil tariffs, Taft
had the courage to tackle
the latter and really do
something about the former. His tariff bill made
him unpopular with farmers, who never seem to be
happy. And his quiet suits
busted the Standard Oil
and tobacco trusts.
He inherited a financially bankrupt reclamation
mess which T. R. had
loudly proclaimed as his
greatest domestic achievement. And Taft, not T. R.,
was years later proved
right in the controversy
over Interior Secretary
Ballinger.
Sen. Kennedy proves
that a little knowledge of
history is a dangerous
thing.
