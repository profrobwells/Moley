Many Subtle Considerations Will
Influence the Big Events of 1960
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Writers and teachers,
whose interest is in the
complex art of politics,
can learn more in what
happens in 1960 than they
ever knew before.
The Presidency is the
immense stake involved.
The course is criss-crossed
with great natural hazards
and is heavily trapped.
The players include some
of the smartest and most
experienced politicians of
the generation. Every
move, every word uttered
must be well calculated.
Those whose compre-
hension of the subtle art
of politics is merely cli-
ches borrowed from oth-
ers or surface impressions
useful for dinner-table or
bar-room conversation
will leap to generalities.
The sophisticated will
creep with utmost care.
Consider the import and
possible consequences of
Sen. John F. Kennedy's
announcement. This
young man, whose official
record is not impressive
and will count heavily
against him in delegates'
and voters' final reckon-
ing when compared with
that of Nixon, his prob-
able opponent, still will
draw upon an unusual
political heritage.
Through his mother
and father he has the
blood of the Fitzgeralds
and the Kennedys, ante-
cedents whose political
exploits in Boston are
historical politics.
His flat rejection of any
suggestion of a Vice Pres-
idential nomination was a
shrewd, calculated move
to put the leaders of the
party machine on a diffi-
cult spot. Much of their
thinking has tended to re-
ject him as a candidate,
despite his popularity.
This is based upon a
very practical considera-
tion of experienced poli-
ticians who approach a
hard contest. That con-
sideration is that it is
never wise in practical
politics to assume an extra
handicap where there is
some way to avoid it.
In this case, those lead-
ers realize that to nomi-
nate a Catholic will arouse
embedded prejudices
against any member of
that faith who aspires to
public office. This extends
from the Presidency down
to alderman in descending
order of virulence.
The easy way to avoid
this handicap and at the
same time to pay a gesture
to the great number of
Catholics who vote the
Democratic ticket seemed
to be Kennedy's nomina-
tion for the Vice Presi-
dency.
Now, if the Massachu-
setts senator means what
he says, state leaders who
will control the convention
face the danger of the ire
of Catholic voters who
quite properly resent the
suggestion that they are
citizens of a lesser grade.
Many leaders who recog-
nize this hard fact will
search the political horizon
for another Catholic for
Vice President. There
emerges a figure who oth-
erwise would not be seri-
ously considered at all,
Gov. Edmund (Pat) Brown
of California, a Catholic
who won his election in
1958 by approximately a
million votes.
There is also Michael V.
DiSalle, governor of Ohio,
also a Catholic. But Brown
must be much more seri-
ously considered because
of the probability that
Nixon stands to be the Re-
publican candidate and he
is, like Brown, a citizen of
a state which will cast a
whopping vote in the elec-
toral college.
Turning from the more
obvious alternatives to
Kennedy for the Presiden-
tial nomination—Hum-
phrey, Stevenson, Johnson
and Symington—I would
suggest another example
rooted in religious consid-
eration, of the fact that
parties tend to ignore out-
standing qualifications and
generally select the sec-
ond or third best for nomi-
nation.
I believe that the best
qualified individual for the
Democratic nomination, if
Democrats are really seek-
ing an able President, is
Abraham Ribicoff, gover-
nor of Connecticut.
His immense success as
an executive in his present
office, his generally excel-
lent judgment, his experi-
ence in Congress, and the
respect shown for him in
that body by his col-
leagues, and the confidence
in him shown by citizens
of all shades of political
and economic opinion
mark him as exceptional.
He is a Jew, however,
and here the same poli-
ticians' fear of unneces-
sarily stirring up animals
would prevail against his
obvious qualifications.
For those who reflect
upon the tendency in a
democracy toward the
mediocre, there is ample
material in what will hap-
pen in 1960.
