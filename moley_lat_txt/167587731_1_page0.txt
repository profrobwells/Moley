Bureaucracy Seeks to Undermine
Purposes of the Education Act
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
School administrators
and government bureau-
crats, who two years ago
helped put through Con-
gress the National Defense
Education Act as a neces-
sary response to the Sput-
nik challenge, are now
busily seeking to under-
mine its basic principle.
That principle was that
the teaching of science,
mathematics and other
basic subjects should be
strengthened.

A spokesman for the
"comprehensive" high
school, with plenty of elec-
tives which provide a
cushion against hard work,
recently in an address to
the National War College
undertook the rather pre-
tentious job of proving
that not only President Ei-
senhower but also ex-
President Hoover and Adm.
Rickover simply do not
know what they are talk-
ing about—presumably,
since they are not alumni
of teachers' colleges.
Their critic was James
E. Russell, secretary of the
educational policies com-
mittee of the National Ed-
ucation Assn. He scoffed at
Mr. Hoover, whose distinc-
tion as an engineer needs
no defense, by saying that
"he did not have, or did
not seek, the professional
background to interpret
the data he used."
Apparently, Hoover
must go to an "education-
ist" to learn mathemat-
ics, even after spending a
long lifetime in practical
engineering over the world
and in public service and
affairs.
Russell then took on
President Eisenhower who
—as anyone who cares to
read his biography in
Who's Who may learn—
took all the stiff education-
al courses that were avail-
able to any Army officer af-
ter his graduation from
West Point.
Russell took a firm stand
against the basic educa-
tional disciplines in this
amazing statement:
"For from raising the
percentage of pupils who
are involved in physics, I
would lower it. Far from
raising the percentage that
takes foreign languages, I
would make it a policy that
no pupil should be per-
mitted (note permitted) to
study the second year of a
foreign language who has
not demonstrated both tal-
ent and determination in
the first year."
That certainly would be
a boon to a lazy student.
He would be told that if he
just loafed in the first
year, he would then get
out of any further bother
with Latin, French or Ger-
man.

While U.S. Commission-
er of Education Dethrick
could not be expected to
take a whack at his boss,
the President, at least pub-
licly, he commissioned
himself to whittle Adm.
Hyman G. Rickover down
to the size of a mere dilet-
tante so far as judging sci-
entific capacity is con-
cerned.
The admiral, as is well
known, developed the
atomic submarine for the
Navy. His modest biogra-
phy in Who's Who notes
only one of the many dis-
tinctions that have come
to him for his scientific
achievements, "The Egle-
ston Medal, Columbia En-
gineering Alumni Assn."
The admiral's alleged of-
fense was that he deplored
the practice of offering to
immature high school stu-
dents a glittering array of
electives and then expect-
ing them to choose for
themselves. He even went
so far in his "heresy" as to
indicate that children in
high school do not have
the experience or back-
ground to know exactly
the sort of courses that are
good for their life in the
world.
His position is that the
public generally is aban-
doning its responsibility
when it permits teen-agers
to have exactly what they
think they want to study
or to determine how to
play.
Here is an issue between
a professional educationist
and a man seasoned in
wielding high administra-
tive authority and in judg-
ing the quality of scientific
work.
Both have been in Rus-
sia. Dethrick went over
with a group of educators
who were given the full
treatment in a tour of the
best show schools. Rick-
over went over to judge
the results of that educa-
tion in scientific work. One
judged by what went on in
the schools; the other saw
what the graduates were
doing with their schooling.
Here is one vote for the
admiral's point of view.
