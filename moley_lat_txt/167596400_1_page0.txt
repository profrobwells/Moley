Can the Air Force Be Relied Upon
to Spend Its Billions Efficiently?
The storied and multi-
ribboned generals of the
Air Force, those gentle-
men of the "wild blue
yonder," are dedicated
men. They are dedicated
to the supremacy of our
nation in the air and in
the spaces beyond the air.
They have valiant expo-
nents of the contention
that the Air Force, along
with the other services,
needs more money for de-
fense. Among these are
members of Congress, gen-
erals-active and retired-
and especially the Demo-
cratic aspirants for the
Presidency.
The specifications of Air
Force needs are lost on
the average citizen be-
cause of demands of se-
crecy and the immense
complications of such cos-
mic matters.
But we can all under-
stand something about the
care and upkeep of auto-
mobiles and trucks. And
most believe that the
measure of a service's ef-
ficiency can be fairly well
judged by what it is do-
ing about such small mat-
ters, Insofar as a man
is faithful in little things,
so he will be in great
things.
Among the civilians who
can understand the care
and upkeep of automobiles
and trucks and the like is
our highly active and ef-
ficient comptroller general
of the United States, Jo-
seph Campbell.
In a recent report to the
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
speaker of the House he
had some interesting
things to say about how
the Air Force handles and
mishandles ground-bound
vehicles.
He notes that vehicle
maintenance has cost the
taxpayers an estimated $5
million over the last three
years because of the post-
ponement of the purchase
of new vehicles as replace-
ments for those that were
worn out.

The terse advice of Cal-
vin Coolidge to "wear 'em
out, use 'em up," may
commend itself to some.
"Making-do" is an old
American tradition. But
the comptroller general
points out how thriftless
such a custom is in this in-
stance.
He states that the Air
Force had, as of Septem-
her, 1957, an inventory of
about 187,500 vehicles rep-
resenting an investment of
nearly $1 billion. The fail-
ure of the Air Force to set
up an adequate replace-
ment program has cost $5
million in depreciated mar-
ket values and repairs-$5
million more than it would
have cost in combined re-
pair and depreciation for
new vehicles.
Now add to that $5 mil-
lion an additional $3 mil-
lion in increased costs of
vehicles due to rising
prices during the last
three years.
And add to that total of
$5 million an additional $2
million annually for the
next several years because
of the inadequacy of the
Air Force's long-range pro-
gram for replacing vehi-
cles, a program that was
adopted in the 1950 fiscal
year.
This wanton loss of
money did not take place
because the eyes of the Air
Force were exclusively
turned upon the heavens
in a search for satellites.
The Air Force knew all
along about this inade-
quacy of its vehicle re-
placement program. But it
failed to explain it to Con-
gress when its budget re-
quests were considered in
any of the years since 1956.

Air Force repair costs
for vehicles are among the
highest, if they are not the
highest, in the entire gov-
ernment. In one two-year
period $91,000 was spent
for repairs on 37 vehicles
which originally cost only
$68,000. On 11 of these ve-
hicles the repair costs in
one year exceeded the orig-
inal cost.
A 1950 sedan which cost
$1,200 ran up repair costs
in eight years of $3,001.
There are similar specifics.
If a civilian businessman
attempted to claim deduc-
tions on a company car at
any such rate the Internal
Revenue people would
haul him in for a going-
over.
If this improvidence is
present in all Air Force
expenditures we are losing
billions.
