RAYMOND MOLEY:
Conservatives Top
Vice Presidency Poll
The poll of Republican
county chairmen by Hu-
man Events, an interest-
ing and influential Wash-
ington newsletter, has
brought out a point that
the party convention and
its candidate for President
should consider if a GOP
victory is to be won this
year.
The poll limited its list
of choices for Vice Presi-
dent to Goldwater, Hal-
leck, Lodge, Hatfield, Kea-
ting, Mitchell, Scott, and
Seaton. Write-ins were
possible. Rockefeller was
not included in the list,
but he received 58 write-
in choices among the 1,-
003 replies.
Goldwater led with 257;
Lodge was next with 251;
Halleck had 149.
If these choices are
grouped, we might regard
the votes for Goldwater,
Halleck, Keating, and the
write-ins for Morton as
preferences for a conserv-
ative ticket. The com-
bined vote of these was
three times that of the
combined "liberals"â€”
Rockefeller, Hatfield,
Mitchell, and Scott. It is
impossible to classify Sea-
ton because there is little
in the record to indicate
a leaning one way or an-
other.
While there are some
who regard Lodge as a
"liberal" because he sup-
ported Eisenhower against
Taft in 1952 and has been
engaged in international
affairs since 1953, there is
nothing in the record to
prove the point. No doubt,
many of his votes were
motivated by the belief
that his experience in in-
ternational affairs would
make him handy for a
President to have around.
It is fair, therefore, to
conclude that almost three
times as many of these
party workers prefer a
conservative candidate for
Vice President as those
who voted for a "liberal."
To strengthen the con-
clusion that these Repub-
licans who want to win
this election prefer a con-
servative ticket with a
specific declaration of con-
servative party principles,
there is the very striking
vote for Goldwater. For
the Arizona senator has
been the most articulate
spokesman in the Senate
for conservative principles
and in a very short time
has become an outstand-
ing national figure.
Now let us consider
these figures in the light
of what so many commen-
tators (mostly Democrats)
and others are telling us.
They are saying substan-
tially that the Republican
candidate and his party
platform must appease the
so-called "Independents"
to win and that these "in-
dependents," who, inci-
dentally, have not been
voting except in the Ei-
senhower elections, are
"liberal."
The nonvoters for the
most part are not inde-
pendent at all. They are
either neglectful or indif-
ferent. And when, as in
the Eisenhower elections,
a few million have come
out, they have not hesitat-
ed to vote for a Republi-
can who, despite some
compromises, has stood
for less spending, less bu-
reaucracy, and for keep-
ing government out of in-
dividual enterprise.
To trim the sails of the
Republican candidate and
his platform to please
these so-called "independ-
ents" would be on the as-
sumption that the regular
party members are "in the
bag" and would have to
support the ticket. These
regulars would do that for
the sake of party and pa-
tronage. They would give
their minds and their
voices to any party candi-
date. But not their hearts.
And anyone who knows
politics must realize that
it is the extra enthusiasm,
zeal, and activity that
come when party work-
ers are happy about their
candidate that brings out
the margin of lazy or in-
different voters necessary
to win an election. To
these workers must be
added the tens of thou-
sands of businessmen who
are for the first time
pledged to get out the
conservative vote at the
local level. There are also
the contributors to the
party funds. To chill these
by a swing to the left
would be equally disas-
trous.
This is something that
Vice President Nixon
must consider when he
hears from those who tell
him fairy tales about win-
ning "independents" and
Democrats by trying to
outpromise the Democrat-
ic candidate, whoever he
may be.
