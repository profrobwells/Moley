The fine pattern of loy-
alty to friends and plain
speaking which character-
ized the late Robert A.
Taft shines through his
memorandum, recently
made public, concerning
the factors which defeat-
ed him for the nomination
in 1952.
His managers before
and at the convention
were in the most uncom-
fortable doghouse for a
long time after the deba-
cle. Perhaps the memo-
randum comes too late to
help them, for they have
apparently outlived the
incident.
Its publication now can-
not help Nixon as against
Rockefeller, because the
present situation of the
Vice President is wholly
unlike that of Taft seven
months before the conven-
tion.
Public interest in the
document, however, justi-
fies those who were close
to the scene in recording
their impressions of the
points raised by Taft. I
was one of those, not only
present at the convention
but in Texas during the
holding of the precinct
conventions which the
Taft memorandum calls
"primaries."
It should be said that I
favored the nomination of
Taft as best qualified and
believed then and believe
now that he could have
been elected.
There is no doubt about
the participation of a pow-
erful and well-heeled Wall
Street group in the Eisen-
hower cause, just as there
had been such an influ-
ence in Presidential poli-
tics previously, and which
exists today.
Such a power had con-
siderable influence in cer-
tain respects, but history
shows that it has failed
many times in the past. I
believe that its ineptitude
in matters political and
the resentment it engen-
ders among those who op-
pose the money power in
politics are a handicap to
any candidate.

It failed in its opposi-
tion to McKinley in 1896,
to Theodore Roosevelt in
1904, to Wilson in 1912,
and, I am assured, to
Hoover in 1928.
The interest of the
press in Gen. Eisenhow-
er, which Taft noted, fol-
lowed a primary instinct
in journalism. The Eisen-
hower cause was a new
and fresh source of news.
He was a new face in
the political scene, and
Taft had been a contend-
er for the nomination
twice before. There was
no "control" of the press
except by that master of
all publishers and editors,
public curiosity.
The fatal mistake in the
Taft management was to
insist upon a proportion
of the Texas delegation
which was not justified by
the facts. I had been pres-
ent at some of the pre-
cinct conventions, at
which Eisenhower senti-
ment prevailed.
Those former Demo-
crats who voted were ac-
tually converts to the Re-
publican Party and were
legally entitled to be
there. To insist upon such
a large block of the Texas
votes in the convention
permitted the opposition
to raise the same moral
issue so ardently exploit-
ed by T. R. in 1912:
"Thou shalt not steal."
And to permit the judg-
ment to go to the conven-
tion floor was a mistake
which determined the ul-
timate result. I wrote that
at the time and still be-
lieve it.
In a more fundamental
sense, the publication of
the story of that conven-
tion serves a purpose. It
highlights the weakness,
duplicity, and double-
crossing that still per-
vade political conven-
tions. There is always a
fringe of delegates that is
sometimes decisive, which
violates pledges, submits
to material pressures and
inducements, or sways in
weakness when the chips
are down.

Without the bloodshed,
this reminds me of the
defeat of Richard III at
Bosworth Field, where
the great Barons Stanley
and Northumberland, de-
spite their obligations to
the king, hurled their
forces against him. The
times change but the hu-
man wickedness and
weakness remain.
If there were a moral
case against Taft, the
same might just as well
apply to the Eisenhower
managers.
