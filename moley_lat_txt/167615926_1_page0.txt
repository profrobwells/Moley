RAYMOND MOLEY:
Arab Ship Picketing
Embarrassing for U.S.
The story of the action
of the American Seafarers'
Union in picketing the
Egyptian ship Cleopatra
shows how a private or-
ganization is able to make
international policy, de-
spite the interests of the
United States government.
What we witnessed was
the exercise of the pow-
er of a labor boss to pro-
voke a grave international
incident at a moment
when tensions were rising
everywhere. Congress and
the Supreme Court, in
their efforts to preserve
the power of the unions,
had tied the hands of the
executive and made it vir-
tually impossible for the
State Department to main-
tain friendly relations
with a very important
group of nations in a vital
spot in the world.
Unrestrained power by
a minority thus not only
violates international law,
but makes new and
strange law and custom.
In the beginning, there
was a peace pact between
Joseph Curran's National
Maritime Union and Paul
Hall's Seafarers' Interna-
tional Union. The purpose
was a joint attack on
American-owned foreign-
flag ships.
Then there was a con-
ference between James
Hoffa of the teamsters
and Curran and Hall about
forming a mighty interna-
tional transportation em-
pire which would have
power to paralyze the
economy of the United
States by sea and land.
But then Hoffa moved
to organize workers in
Puerto Ricoâ€”a raid on
SIU preserves. There was
an election and SIU won
out over Hoffa's team-
sters. This made bad blood
between Hall and Hoffa.
Last month at a labor
convention in Miami, Hall
made a speech as presi-
dent of the AFL-CIO Mar-
itime Trades Department,
which encompasses many
maritime unions. It was a
strong attack on Hoffa, es-
pecially concerning Hof-
fa's relations with Harry
Bridges of the West
Coast Longshoremen's Un-
ion.
Thereupon, Curran
made a speech at the
same convention, bitterly
criticizing Hall and de-
claring that Hall did not
speak for the AFL-CIO
Maritime Trades Depart-
ment but only as head of
his own union. Thus a rift
between the allies, Cur-
ran and Hall, became pub-
lic.
Hall, ignoring his fellow
labor bosses, then began a
personal adventure in for-
eign relations, which had
immediate repercussions.
He ordered the picketing
of the privately owned
Egyptian ship Cleopatra as
it docked in New York, as
a protest against UAR pol-
icy. That was on April 13.
President Nasser forth-
with indicated his dis-
pleasure and threatened
retaliation. The American
ambassador was sum-
moned to the Egyptian
foreign ministry, but had
to say that the American
government had no legal
means of ending the pick-
eting of the Cleopatra.
Hall then injected him-
self further into interna-
tional relations by cabling
Nasser, certainly an ex-
traordinary and indefen-
sible usurpation of the
rights of a nation to carry
on its own diplomatic re-
lations.
An injunction against
the picketing was asked by
the Cleopatra's owners.
Dist. Judge Murphy was
compelled to deny it, be-
cause only days earlier the
U.S. Supreme Court had
declared that a federal
court could not enjoin a
union from picketing a for-
eign-flag ship so long as a
labor dispute was in-
volved.
A U.S. Circuit Court on
appeal by the owners held
that no labor dispute was
involved, but that no basis
had been established for a
federal injunction. And so
the government's hands
were tied.
Meanwhile, Nasser re-
taliated, declaring a boy-
cott on all U.S.-Flag ships
at UAR ports. His action
was sustained by other
Arab countries. In Libya,
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan,
Sudan, Lebanon, Tunisia,
and as far as Bombay
there were ominous ef-
fects.
Diplomacy is the only
means through which our
government, thus denied
legal recourse by our
courts, can resolve such a
difficulty. That diplomacy
seems to have been quite
ineffective as far as Nasser
is concerned.
But pleas by the State
Department to end the
picketing because the
United States was being
embarrassed in its foreign
relations were met by the
endorsement of Hall's ac-
tion by the AFL-CIO. And
so finally the acting secre-
tary of state had to collab-
orate with Arthur J.
Goldberg, representative
of the unions, in approach-
ing AFL-CIO president
Meany to beg of Hall that
the picketing be stopped.
Hall, exhilarated by this
triumph, said in Duluth
that American labor must
insist on "full participa-
tion" in foreign affairs.
Who is running this
government anyhow?
