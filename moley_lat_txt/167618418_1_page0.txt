RAYMOND MOLEY:-*
Hoffa's Merry Men
Are in a Legal Net
We shall now see
whether James Hoffa and
his merry men can again
wriggle out of a legal net.
Also, we shall see whether
the Department of Justice
really intends to enforce
the provisions in the
Taft-Hartley legislation
dealing with labor unions'
political activities.
Two locals of the Teamsters,
together with six officials
of the locals of the
Teamsters, are involved.
★
The individuals named
in a 22-count indictment
in St. Louis include Harold
J. Gibbons, who has been
prominently in the news
because of his extensive
appearances before the
McClellan committee. He
is a vice president of the
national union as well as
an officer of the local
which generally directs
the operations of the
Teamsters in St. Louis. He
is also administrative
assistant to Hoffa.
Another official named
is Sidney Zagri, legislative
counsel for the international
organization.
The law allegedly violated
is Section 610 of Title 18
of the U.S. Code. It was
included in the Taft-Hartley
legislation. In substance,
the law is an addition to
legislation passed in 1907
forbidding contributions to
campaigns for federal
offices by corporations. The
Taft-Hartley legislation put
labor organizations under
the same prohibition.
★
The alleged beneficiaries
of alleged contributions
are Sens. Hennings and
Morse, Reps. James
Roosevelt of California,
Henry Reuss of Wisconsin
and two Missouri candidates
for the House who failed
of election. These contributions
were made for primaries
and elections in 1956.
Hennings, Morse, Roosevelt
and Reuss have stated
since the indictment that
they presumed the contributions
were from funds
voluntarily subscribed by
members of the unions.
It should be pointed out
that unions quite generally
collect voluntary contributions
from members for
political purposes. But the
provisions of the law prohibit
contributions from the
general funds of unions,
which are made up of dues
collected from all members.
In the indictment in St.
Louis it is charged that
the contributions "were
derived substantially or
entirely from the dues
payments made by members"
for the "general purposes"
of the union.
This section of the law
was invoked against the
United Automobile Workers
for something that happened
in the 1954 campaign. An
indictment was secured
which the federal district
judge in Michigan dismissed.
★
When it was carried to
the Supreme Court, the
indictment was reinstated
and Mr. Justice Frankfurter
delivered a lengthy opinion
concerning the history of
the legislation and its
importance.
He said: "What is involved
here is the integrity of
the electoral process, and,
not less, the responsibility
of the individual citizen for
the successful functioning
of that process. This case
thus raises issues not less
than basic to a democratic
society."
However, when the case
was tried before the same
judge who had dismissed
the indictment, there was
an acquittal. The Justice
Department then seemed to
regard the statute as a dead
letter.
The facts in the Teamsters
case seem much more
substantial than in the UAW
case. In that instance, what
was involved was payment
by the union for a radio
broadcast on which a
candidate appeared. There
was no direct monetary
contribution involved. In the
present case the alleged
facts go straight to the
heart of the matter.
★
The question is whether
a union member's money
which he contributes as
dues for the general purposes
of the union can be used
to support political candidates
whom he may or may not
favor. In short, the alleged
offense is the injustice of
using money contributed for
another purpose to support
a candidate repugnant to
the contributor, and without
his express permission.
