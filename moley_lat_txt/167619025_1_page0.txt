Despite Soviet Success, America's
Free Enterprise Still Proves Best
At a thousand festive
occasions in the months
ahead, at least four Demo-
cratic candidates will pro-
vide digestive relaxation
after the coffee and
liqueur.
The groaning of the ta-
bles under the edibles
with which they are load-
ed will be accompanied by
the groaning of the candi-
dates about what dire
things will happen to us
all if the Republicans are
returned to power next
November.
The food, no doubt, will
be comestible, but the ora-
tory should be plentifully
sprinkled with salt.
One of the four aspiring
senators is poor in pocket
if not in spirit and an
articulate friend of all who
share his sad worldly es-
tate.
Three are worth, in
money at least, some mil-
lions of 1960 dollars. These
millions were accumulated
in the chapters of a na-
tion's history in which the
virtues of economic free-
dom were written indeli-
bly and with supporting
footnotes.
It requires a certain tol-
erance, mixed with a
soothing sense of humor,
to hear them say, as they
are saying, that embattled
and fanatical Marxism can
in the near future dis-
prove that luminous his-
tory.
I have neither the com-
petence nor the preten-
sions needed to argue the
relative military might of
the United States and the
Soviet Union. That de-
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
bate will be in the hands
of those who know what
we laymen cannot know.
But in the field of econom-
ic enterprise, which is also
opened to political debate
this year, I would like to
list a few facts about one
of the bastions of an eco-
nomic system, electrical
power.
Perhaps my authority
here will be questioned
by some as being handi-
capped by self-interest.
Certainly we will be
scoffed at by those who
hate what they designate
as "the power trust." But
I shall name my authority,
and those who wish to
quarrel over his conclu-
sion might address their
dissent to him rather than
to this mere reporter.

Edward Vannard, man-
aging director of the Edi-
son Electric Institute, re-
ported recently about the
findings of a group of rep-
resentatives, of which he
was a member, who made
two visits, in 1958 and
1959, to the Soviet Union
to inspect its power facili-
ties and its plants for the
manufacture of electrical
equipment.
Their inspection trips
occupied some five weeks
and covered 16,000 miles
in European Russia, the
Urals and Siberia. Their
conclusion is that, conced-
ing the success of the So-
viet's seven-year plan
ending in 1965, there is no
remote chance that Russia
can overtake the United
States in the foreseeable
future.
The present and pros-
pective figures of produc-
tion capability are:
In 1959 the United
States produced 183 mil-
lion kilowatts; Russia, an
estimated 59 million. In
1965 we will produce 245
million kilowatts. Russia's
goal, if attained, 110 mil-
lion to 112 million kilo-
watts.
These advantages apply
to all three of the means of
producing electricity:
steam, hydro and atomic
energy.
In transmission lines,
Russia has 46,500 miles.
With a third of Russia's
area, we have 240,000.
The per capita use com-
parison is 4,481 for us,
1,161 for the Soviet Union.
Because this is a measure
of comparative standards
of living, the gap is very
meaningful.

Since in the philosophy
and plans of socialism,
government ownership
and operation of electric
power production and dis-
tribution are not only first
in priority but easiest to
nationalize among all in-
dustrial activities, this
comparison is especially
notable.
There is no reason why
we should be complacent.
We must continue to pro-
gress and grow, not just to
keep ahead of Russia but
for the benefit of higher
standards for all Ameri-
cans. But the fears of poli-
ticians are quite without
justification.
