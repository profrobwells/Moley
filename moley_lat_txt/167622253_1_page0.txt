A Few Reasonable Reservations
About Planning National Goals
When a writer has
doubts about the useful-
ness of a project, however
nobly designed, he should
state at the outset his opin-
ions upon which such res-
ervations are rooted. In
this case, the project is the
creation of a vast blueprint
on national goals by a dis-
tinguished group of cit-
izens headed by Henry M.
Wriston. This was indicat-
ed as a desirable project
last year by the President,
but the members were not
named until recently.
My doubts about goals
of a national character can
best be stated in what I
wrote in a book eight years
ago:
"Liberty permeates the
nation with a million
forces; the achievement is
unpredictable, and therein
lies the zest of anticipa-
tion. As long as we are
sure of the direction in
which we are going and
are sure of the motives
and principles that guide
us, we can anticipate a
better life. That should be
enough assurance for free
men.
This, I should add, was
a conclusion reached with
deliberation after more
than 300 pages in which I
described the forces which
had created American
progress, the dangers that
threatened it, and some of
the principles in many
fields of activity that
should guide us.
Perhaps I was influ-
enced by a memorable ob-
servation written a good
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
many years ago by a great
citizen of Indiana, Mere-
dith Nicholson. He wrote
in his "Valley of Democ-
racy" that democracy is "a
quest," not a perfectly at-
tained state of affairs. Per-
haps I might add that my
concept of the afterlife is
not a heaven of happy but
suspended animation but
a continuation of the labor
and striving that is our lot
on earth.

A professor who re-
viewed my book at the
time, not unfavorably, ex-
pressed his regret that I
had omitted "goalism."
The word, which is a part
of the patter of modern so-
cial science, always makes
my flesh creep. I am in-
clined to associate it with
the macabre ghost that
pursued Tam O'Shanter
and tore off the tail of his
horse.
There are so many im-
ponderables in our life, so
many factors which are
buried in the inscrutable
recesses of human nature,
so many virile minds at
work in a free society plan-
ning in their own way, in-
venting and adapting, so
many vagaries in public
taste. I surmise that the
automobile makers five
years ago were unable to
determine in advance how
high to make the tailfins of
their cars and how soon
they would have to go back
to lower posteriors.
When the President sug-
gested this search for
goals, he noted as a prece-
dent President's Hoover's
Research Committee on
Social Trends and its 1,600-
page report. It was pub-
lished toward the end of
the Hoover administra-
tion, just as the Wriston
goals will be announced at
the end of the Eisenhower
administration.
A copy of the Hoover
committee's report came
to those of us who were
planning the objectives of
the Roosevelt administra-
tion. After a glance at it,
we discarded it completely
and, so far as I know, it
had no influence at all. It
was a laudable experiment,
but the new administration
had plans of its own. So,
I feel, will the Wriston re-
port live on only to give
dusty answers to the few
who will consult it.

The usefulness of the
Hoover administration's
guide was limited to a
very important end. It
gave employment, in a
time of unemployment, to
many a hard-pressed pro-
fessor and statistician. As
a guide, it was wholly ig-
nored. People and compa-
nies were too busy getting
under way after the crush-
ing depression. Govern-
ment was too busy getting
its policies adopted and
working. Politicians were
too busy getting votes.
In a free nation men
cannot be contained in
plans made by those whom
they follow. This might be
noted by the elders who
make up the Wriston com-
mission.
