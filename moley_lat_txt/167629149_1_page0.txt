RAYMOND MOLEY:
Political Machine Is
on the Way Out
Today anyone interested
in the pathology of politics
may observe two advanced
cases of the political ma-
chine's deterioration, per-
haps in its terminal stage.
One is New York City's
Tammany Hall. There that
battered old Tiger is
racked with the foul dis-
ease of corruption and its
many complications.
The other is the Cook
County machine which has
controlled Chicago for 28
years and is now display-
ing all the symptoms asso-
ciated with an aging or-
ganization.
★
Chicagoans who read the
latest revelations of the
erupting police scandal in
their papers must experi-
ence the feelings of seeing
a motion picture for the
second time.
This has all happened
before. Those with a mem-
ory of the 20s recall the
last gasps of the Republi-
can machine under Big
Bill Thompson, and then
the advent of an energetic
new Democratic machine
under Mayor Anton Joseph
Cermak.
Presently attention in
Chicago centers on Mayor
Richard J. Daley's admin-
istration, particularly the
police force. Among the
thousands of Chicago's
good and honest policemen
there has always been a
core of "sharpies," those
with "political clout" who
have prospered mightily
and illegally. There was
the exposure of Tubbo Gil-
bert, "the world's richest
cop."
★
This time the city is
shaken as never before.
While in the past police
sins have been closely tied
to the criminal elements
present in a big city, now
there is the disclosure of
organized burglar rings
within the department.
Citizens have been robbed
by men paid to protect
them, and police cars have
been used to haul away the
loot.
In 1959 Mayor Daley's
Cook County machine sur-
vived several scandals, ap-
parently without lessening
his power in the post of
mayor or county chairman.
A bail-bond scandal result-
ed in the indictment of a
municipal court justice
and seven others.
Then Republican State's
Atty. Adamowski charged
that ticket-fixing and fine-
stealing in Chicago's traffic
court was a half-million-
dollar racket.
Subsequently, the Daley
regime was attacked by
the press. A place of pros-
titution a scant half-block
from City Hall and doing
a half-million dollars of
illicit business annually
was exposed. A score of
hoodlums and gangsters
turned up on the city pay-
roll. Parolee Roger Touhy
was erased gangland
style.
To this Mayor Daley
said, "There are no hood-
lums in Chicago." There
are no fleas in dogdom.
And he ruled on, unper-
turbed.
★
The police scandal may
well have a different ef-
fect. When Mayor Daley
wrote out his slate of can-
didates to run in the April
primary in Illinois, his
pick for governor was im-
mediately opposed.
State Treasurer Joseph
Lohman, who holds his
elective office because of
the backing of the Daley
machine, and Stephen A.
Mitchell, former chair-
man of the Democratic
National Committee, are
running hard against a
man who is not on the
ticket — Mayor Richard J.
Daley.
Republican Gov. Strat-
ton has ordered the mayor
to clean up the Chicago
Police Department, "or
else." He has also sug-
gested that the Democratic
Party rid itself of Mayor
Daley.
Like Mayor Wagner of
New York, Mayor Daley
may well be at the bedside
of the expiring power that
has sustained him, a once
vigorous political ma-
chine. Personally, both
are accused of no crimes
or wrongdoing.
★
But into the vitals of
both Tammany and the
Cook County organization
have crept the deadly
viruses that machines are
heir to. Mayor Daley is
attending a sagging giant.
Perhaps he will lead the
Illinois delegation to Los
Angeles. Then again,
hopefuls for the Presi-
dential nomination may
not have to deal with the
mayor at all.
