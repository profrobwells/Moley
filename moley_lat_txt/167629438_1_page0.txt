RAYMOND MOLEY:
A Worthy Contender
for Vice President
If a stranger to our
ways were to take at face
value all the gossip he
hears about the possibili-
ties for the Republican
Vice Presidential nomina-
tion, he would conclude
that it is an office devout-
ly to be avoided.
The image is of pre-
Nixon days, when that
constitutional office, once
graced by John Adams
and Thomas Jefferson, de-
generated into a voiceless,
idle sinecure. Yet he
might immediately mis-
trust this conclusion when
he realizes that today's
Vice President may well
be the Republican Party's
nominee for President in
six months.
*
Perhaps some of the
talk is meant to whittle
down Richard M, Nixon's
stature by reducing the
office to its past Lillipu-
tian proportions. But in
most of the "dope" we
find a search going on for
a person who would of-
fend no one, who would
"represent" some geo-
graphical section, or some
religious group, or a
school of ideology far re-
moved from that of the
Presidential candidate, or
some other irrelevance.
The reality is that Pres-
ident Eisenhower and
Vice President Nixon have
built a new significance
into the office. Geography
and religion have become
irrelevant.
The truth is that a can-
didate for Vice President
cannot win votes for the
ticket and may lose some.
He should be ideological-
ly like the man whom he
might succeed, in case na-
ture or an assassin's bul-
let calls him to the suc-
cession.
★
He should be fairly
young and capable of
learning the Presidential
duties and responsibilities
and be able to speak at
home and abroad for the
President's policies. He
should be the first mate
on the Ship of State.
Governors, so often
chosen in the past, are
versed in state, not na-
tional affairs. Senators are
mostly too old and are set
in their ideas and ways.
The best place to look for
the new qualifications is
among the fairly young
members of the House of
Representatives.
They know how to cam-
paign, or they wouldn't be
where they are; they
know a lot, if they have
been faithful to their
House work. And their
youth is measurable as-
surance that they will live
through the term.
Consider, for example,
Gerald R. Ford Jr., 47,
representative from the
5th Michigan District. He
is serving his sixth con-
secutive term. His life has
been full, and his career
auspicious.
★
At the University of
Michigan he not only did
his studies well but was
a star on the great Wol-
verine championship foot-
ball teams of the 1930s.
He was chosen "most val-
uable player" on the team
of 1934, and last year was
selected on the "After 25
Years All-America" team.
He graduated from the
Yale Law School. Four
years of service in the
Navy during the war fol-
lowed. Then, encouraged
by the late Sen. Vanden-
berg, he entered politics
and in 1948 won the seat
which he now occupies.
In succeeding elections
he has had higher and
higher majorities, exceed-
ing even President Eisen-
hower in 1952 and 1956.
A keen political reporter
in Grand Rapids says that
"his personality and sin-
cerity are characteristics
that deeply impress those
who know him." And ap-
parently that includes a
huge majority of his fel-
low citizens.
★
His record in the House
has been fundamentally
conservative. He has vot-
ed consistently for limit-
ing government expendi-
tures, for legislation pro-
tecting the free economy,
for restricting the danger-
ous power of union boss-
es, and for ample national
security.
In a state shaken by fi-
nancial troubles and mis-
government, he has been
urged to run against Gov.
Mennen Williams or for
senator. But he has pre-
ferred the opportunities
for greater influence in
the House.
These are obvious qual-
ifications for the revital-
ized office of Vice Presi-
dent.
