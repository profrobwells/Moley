Fiscal Responsibility Is Required
for Proper Use of Defense Dollars
While the behemoths in
the armed services are
telling Congress they are
being starved under the
President's budget, the
bureaucracy over which
they preside, or have pre-
sided, goes its wayward,
wasteful wav.
Mr. Taxpayer, who can-
not know enough or take
enough time from earning
enough to pay his taxes
to get at the bottom of the
dispute, should know that
his chief watchdog in
Washington, the comptrol-
ler general, is saying some
simple but appalling
things about waste in
small things. This should
point up the proverbial
truth that whoever is lack-
ing in little things may
well be failing in big
things, too.

Not long ago, the comp-
troller general made a re-
port to Congress on the
military assistance pro-
gram which is adminis-
tered by the Navy Depart-
ment.
With abundant detailed
proof, he showed that
more money is being spent
in putting ships in condi-
tion which are being de-
livered to other countries
than it costs to fix up our
own fighting ships.
To be specific: LST
1110, a ship in the active
U.S. fleet, was overhauled
by the Navy in 1956 at a
cost of $172,000. Three
years later, it was decided
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
to turn this same ship
over to a friendly country,
and the Navy spent $635,-
000 putting it into condi-
tion.
When the comptroller
general's men began dig-
ging into this sort of
thing, the Navy bureau-
crats said the difference
represented the rise in la-
bor costs in three years—
$41 a productive man-
day in July, 1956, to $61
a day in January, 1958. No
corporation economist
would claim such an in-
crease, and every labor
economist would hoot at
the claim.

The Navy people might
bitterly complain about
the inefficiency of naval
shipyards, which has been
traditional. They might
say that the civilian per-
sonnel in those shipyards
demand a very costly form
of largess before work is
commenced.
This takes the form of
coffee, sugar, canned
hams, vegetables, and oth-
er comestibles to be paid
over as a fee before work
orders are honored. But
not even this could make
up the rise of $20 a day
per man.
The comptroller general
gives attention to the sup-
plying of spare parts for
ships sent abroad under
the military assistance
program. It is the custom
of the Navy to provide
enough spare parts for 12
ships for each ship of each
type delivered.
Even though two ships
may have identical arma-
ment, but are of different
types, enough spare parts
are supplied for 24
ships. In one transac-
tion, three landing ships-
tank (LST), three landing
ships-medium (LSM), and
five patrol craft (PC), each
mounting 40-mm. and 20-
mm. guns, were delivered
to a single country be-
tween March and Novem-
ber, 1957.
The Bureau of Ordnance
of the Navy authorized
enough spare parts for the
guns to accommodate 48
ships for a year, at a cost
of $150,000.
This is sheer bureaucrat-
ic lunacy, because nobody
in the Navy seems to have
considered that different
types of ships might
mount the same types of
guns. The Bureau of Ord-
nance said that this may
be uneconomical but that
"it was not significant in
relation to the value of the
ships involved."
★
This seems to mean that
the bigger the value, the
less there is need for econ-
omy.
One can only consider
what this philosophy of
waste would mean when
applied to such expensive
items as intercontinental
missiles or space expedi-
tions.
