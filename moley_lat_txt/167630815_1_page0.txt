Presidential Assistants Discover
Slippery Ground Near the Throne
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This is not the book
reviewing department, and
this essay is not a review
of a new book called "The
Invisible Presidency." But
my interest was awakened
by the title's amazing sug-
gestion that a major Pres-
idential adviser is invis-
ible. If he really exercises
influence, he is about as
invisible as a beatnik's
beard.
In President Roosevelt's
second term several "as-
sistants to the President"
were authorized by Con-
gress. Some pundit who
participated in the report
upon which the Reorgani-
zation Act was based said
that these assistants should
have a "passion for ano-
nymity."
The expression origi-
nated, I believe, with Sir
Maurice Hankey, who for
many years was the sec-
retary to the cabinet in
Britain. Gen. Hugh John-
son, noting that sugges-
tion, wrote in his newspa-
per column that such as-
sistants would be as in-
visible and anonymous as
"a herd of elephants in six
feet of snow."
The absurdity of using
the word "invisible" be-
came more apparent when
I scanned the list of the
seven characters treated
in the book as examples.
Two were statesmen in
their own right with top
official status, Alexander
Hamilton and Martin Van
Buren. One was the ex-
tremely well known and
efficient stenographer and
secretary to President
Theodore Roosevelt, Wil-
liam Loeb Jr.
Three were real in-
timates and policy makers,
Col. House, Harry Hop-
kins and Sherman
Adams — as conspicuous
in their time as the Wash-
ington Monument.
The seventh was Tommy
Corcoran, who enjoyed a
very brief use of the White
House telephone. He was
far from invisible. Inci-
dentally, the author tells
us that Corcoran is doing
"invisible" piloting for
Sen. Lyndon Johnson.

Since my own experi-
ence has enabled me to
see, feel and test the slip-
pery ground that sur-
rounds a President, I feel
qualified to make some ob-
servations.
I can best illustrate by
telling of a party given
by the late Eleanor Patter-
son in honor of Donald
Richberg in the early
1930s. Richberg had just
been proclaimed by the
press as the latest of Pres-
ident Roosevelt's trouble-
shooters. When asked to
make a "few remarks," I
uttered only one sentence:
"As a past assistant Pres-
ident to a new one, may
the Lord have mercy on
your soul."
Anyone placed in a po-
sition between the awe-
some power of a President
and his official family,
which includes the cabi-
net members and the big
bureau chiefs, is bitterly
resented.
The President suffers
to the extent that this as-
sistant exercises power.
He is a target for the press,
bedeviled by the gentry
who want to get some-
thing — "a good word to
the boss," an introduc-
tion to somebody, etc.
Members of Congress, al-
ways conscious that they
are members of a co-or-
dinate branch of govern-
ment, want no insulation
between them and the
Chief Executive. As the
sage Sam Rayburn once
said, they "want no Ras-
putins around."
The greatest error made
by President Eisenhower
was his attempt to incor-
porate a military concept
in a political whirlpool by
making Sherman Adams
"the" assistant to the
President. We all know
what happened to that un-
fortunate man.

It is quite demonstrable
that a President needs a
very special type of help
— near, quick, depend-
able, who can also tell the
President the truth.
Bruce Barton, who en-
joyed a pleasant intimacy
with President Coolidge,
once likened such a con-
fidant to Caesar's slave,
who, according to not
very well authenticated
tradition, had only one
duty. That was to say
over and over to his mas-
ter: "Remember, Caesar,
thou, too, art mortal."
After enjoying his co-
lossal power for a time,
every President repels
such doubts as to his di-
vinity. It may have been
good for Caesar. But it
must have been an infer-
no for the slave.
