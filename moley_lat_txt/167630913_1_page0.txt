RAYMOND MOLEY:
Social Security Was
Understood in 1838
No doubt, in the vast
bureaucracy of the De-
partment of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare a con-
siderable number of stat-
isticians are figuring out
what a retired person
needs to sustain a reason-
able standard of living,
for submission to Con-
gress when the next in-
crease in Social Security
payments is up for con-
sideration.
I have a suggestion for
such an analysis which I
certainly do not expect to
be adopted. It is amusing,
however, and may stimu-
late recipients of old-age
assistance to do some fig-
uring on their own ac-
count and for their own
enlightenment.
★
I have before me the
will made by a rather
well-to-do Pennsylvania
farmer in 1838, in which
provision is made with
minute care for the main-
tenance of his surviving
widow so long as she
might live.
Whether, if calculated
in terms of 1960 dollar
costs, the sum of her in-
heritance and annual pro-
vision for upkeep would
exceed the figure of the
Department of HEW, I do
not know. That labor is
beyond the capacity of a
busy newspaper writer.
This gentleman left ex-
tensive lands which were
apportioned among several
sons. But primarily the
testator was interested in
imposing upon his numer-
ous heirs the responsibili-
ty for seeing to it that the
faithful companion of his
years was kept in security
and comfort.
★
After consigning his
soul to the Almighty and
his body to Mother Earth
and providing for all legit-
imate debts, he came to
his prospective widow.
The provisions for her
may be divided into three
categories: house and
equipment, maintenance
of same, food and raiment.
She was given a house
and garden adjoining the
ancestral home, two bed-
steads, beds and bedding,
one bureau, one table,
four chairs, two small iron
pots, frying pan, nine
knives and nine forks, cof-
fee pot and boiler, one set
of teacups and saucers,
one teapot, six pewter
plates, one dozen earthen
plates, six tablespoons and
six teaspoons, nine milk
pots, one tub, one tram-
mel, one small and one
large tin pail, one churn,
one band box, spinning
wheel and reel, sadirons,
looking glass and candle-
stick, one large chest, one
stove, and one large iron
pot. These were to be
hers outright.
★
As maintenance it was
set forth that the garden
was to be manured and
well plowed every year.
A sufficiency of firewood
was to be hauled to the
door and $4 was to be
provided annually to cut
it. The sons and executors
were instructed that if
she were to be ill and
the itemized articles and
provision were insuffi-
cient, they were to see to
it that proper care was
forthcoming.
To maintain her bodily
needs, the following were
prescribed annually: 10
bushels of wheat, 12 bush-
els of corn, 10 bushels of
buckwheat, 10 bushels of
winter apples "if the or-
chard bears them but not
otherwise."
★
Every year she was to
have the choice of any
tree in the orchard, 20 lb.
of beef, $2 worth of wool,
and $1 worth of flax. She
was to have one cow, the
pick of the herd, with
pasture in summer and
fodder in winter, and four
fowls "to have the privi-
lege of running on the
farm." In addition, there
were to be $5 and one pig
annually.
All this she was to re-
ceive in lieu of her dower
rights.
This is not to suggest
that the foregoing would
be adequate in these days
of automobiles, television,
and other additions to the
joy of life. But it does
suggest one of the first,
simple but experienced
itemizations of what social
security should consist of.
The moral traditions of
those times are implied in
the solemn requirement
that the progeny should
maintain the progenitors
after their capacities were
exhausted.
