RAYMOND MOLEY:
Sen. Harry F. Byrd
vs. the Profligates
Frequently Harry F.
Byrd seems to stand out
almost alone — a prudent
man amid a field of prof-
ligates. For this he should
be remembered years
hence, when your descend-
ants are still paying for
the extravagances of oth-
ers.
His consistent reason
should be fresh when the
outpourings of most of his
colleagues are buried from
remembrance in some
dank cellar of the Library
of Congress.
Most recently, the Vir-
ginia senator has made
public his correspondence
with Secretary of Com-
merce Frederick H. Muel-
ler on the matter of our
federal highway program.
What he has to say about
an "inexcusable mess" is
lucid, concise and trench-
ant.

As chairman of the Sen-
ate Finance Committee,
Byrd must strive to see
that the fiscal integrity of
the federal government is
preserved. In accomplish-
ing this he has sometimes
to perform onerous tasks.
In the last session he found
it necessary to steer a bill
to passage increasing the
federal gasoline tax and
diverting general revenue
to the highway trust fund.
This was an expedient
which he hopes will not
be permanent, forced by
developments arising from
the 1958 interstate high-
way legislation with its
90-10 matching formula—
the federal government
putting up $90 for each
$10 supplied by the states.
In his letter to the sec-
retary, Sen. Byrd under-
lines the fact that last year
"federal spenders aban-
doned the highway pay-as-
we-go policy and gorged
themselves on authoriza-
tions and allocation."

No one involved, he
pointed out, can escape
blame for what was done.
"The administration ap-
proved it. Congress enact-
ed it. States were amena-
ble and let the contracts.
Contractors bid on the pro-
posals. They all knew they
were bankrupting the
fund."
Essentially, the 1958
legislation put an irresisti-
ble lure in the hands of
federal spenders. The
states have fallen to the
temptation of acquiring
large sums of federal mon-
ey with relatively small
state outlays. Systems
were launched precipitous-
ly. And this has been done
with little thought given
to the devious evils of the
temptation.
To date, the interstate
program has shown many
of the haphazard and
wasteful characteristics of
a crash program. Rights-
of-way acquisition costs
exceed what they should
be. Collusion and fraud
have been made easier
than under a program of
meeting highway needs
more gradually and effi-
ciently with available
funds.

There is also the pres-
ence of inordinately ex-
pensive roads, "dream de-
signs without limit on ex-
penses."
In brief, Byrd points out
that the Clay Commission
in 1954 estimated the in-
terstate system should
cost $23 billion. "Now the
program has been revised
and the estimate raised to
$39.9 billion or more
than 73% in five years."
In January, 1961, the
secretary of commerce
must present a new esti-
mate with a report on find-
ings and recommendations
to Congress. Sen. Byrd's
letter asks Secretary Muel-
ler to deal frankly with
the size and expedited
schedule of the interstate
system and the possibility
of overtaxing the finan-
cial, technical, and admin-
istrative facilities at the
state, local and federal
levels.

"I hope strengthening
financial control through-
out all levels of govern-
ment will not await your
1961 report," Byrd says.
He hopes for Commerce
Department co-operation
with the Bureau of Public
Roads and the General Ac-
counting Office.
Byrd's observations de-
serve wide attention. They
spring from 50 years of
work for sound, progres-
sive highways. He is large-
ly credited with the de-
velopment of Virginia's
state highway system. As
governor he achieved suc-
cessful financing and ad-
ministration of roads be-
fore he went to the Sen-
ate in 1933.
His experience and best
thinking is that continu-
ing, sound progress can
be made in meeting our
highway transportation
requirements with a max-
imum of efficiency and
economy and a minimum
of nonessentials and prof-
iteering on a pay-as-we-go
basis.
