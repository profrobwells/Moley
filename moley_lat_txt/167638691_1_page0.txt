KATMUND MÃœLET:
New Laws to Guard
Communications Vital
Twenty-four hundred
years ago, a Chinese general named Sun Tzu said:
"Hostile armies may face
each other for years striving for victory which is
decided in a single day.
This being so, to remain in
ignorance of the enemy's
condition... is (folly). One
who acts thus is no leader
of men. no present help
... no master of victory.
Thus, what enables the
wise sovereign and the
good general to strike and
to conquer, and achieve
things beyond the reach
of ordinary men, is fore-
knowledge."

Matters of intelligence
and security have been
and must always be of
concern to those who
would survive, whether
through maintaining peace
or engaging in war. Khrushchev's terrible tantrums
and faked astonishment
over the U-2 incident may
be regarded as of positive
value to the free world,
for his behavior should
strengthen the purpose of
various mutual defense alliances. His shocking insults aimed at President
Eisenhower and his
threats leveled at certain
nations, should move governments and peoples into
a greater awareness of
communism's inflexible objectives.
Since the U-2's over-
flight, the wide discussion
of intelligence activity conducted by all world powers has emphasized the
need for strengthening
our counterintelligence.
Not only must security
measures be as adequate
as possible to defeat foreign activities in sabotage,
espionage and subversion,
but laws must be enacted
for the punishment of
such acts.

One of our vital systems
contributing to national
security is defense communications. Communication networks, which are
the backbone of our plans
against surprise attack,
would perhaps be made
less vulnerable under a
bill introduced by Sen.
James O. Eastland. This
stems from testimony before a subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee by Brig. Gen. Wendell
H. Duplantis of the Office
of Civil and Defense Mobilization and Brig. Gen.
John B. Bestic of the Air
Force. It emphasizes the
importance of amending
present law to extend
criminal penalties for malicious damage to communications facilities to
those "used or intended to
be used for military or
civil defense functions.
..." The law presently applies only to communications "operated or controlled by the United
States."
Gen. Duplantis pointed
out that "few, if any, of
our systems are operated
or controlled by the United
States. Rather, these
networks are owned by
commercial carriers and
are under their complete
supervision....willful or
malicious damage could
isolate from the OCDM
networks of an entire city
or even a state and thereby cause the use of substitute facilities which might
seriously handicap immediate implementation of
OCDM programs for civilian defense."
*
Gen. Bestic said the Air
Force is "probably the
largest single user of commercial communications in
the United States." Among
the systems operated by
the Air Force through
commercial lines are the
Strategic Air Command's
primary alerting system,
which enables SAC headquarters to alert 70 bases
immediately; the ballistic
missile early warning
DFDOEM now being constructed; extensive communication networks for
control and operating of
Atlas and Titan missile-
launching bases, and nuclear bomb detection and
alarm systems.
The Army and Navy are
similarly interested in
making more secure the
nation's incomparable telephone and telegraph networks. This legislation,
like other legislation designed to give the United
States greater security, is
needed. The men responsible for drafting it, including Malcolm R. Wil-
key, assistant attorney
general, criminal division,
do not foresee a time when
the ancient practices of intelligence, sabotage, espionage and subversion
will be abandoned.
