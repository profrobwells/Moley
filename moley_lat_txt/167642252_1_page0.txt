Kennedy's Fate Hangs on Primary
in Wisconsin, a Dangerous State
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A political writer whose
early experience was on
the sea has called Wiscon-
sin a "veritable Charyb-
dis." The allusion is to the
rock in "The Odyssey"
which sucked in sea wa-
ter along with whatever
mariners happened to be
near and then exhaled
foamy water and the
wrecks of ships and men.
into that danger in 16
years three candidates
have gone, have been
swallowed up and spewed
forth with shattered
dreams - Willkie in 1944,
Dewey and MacArthur in
1948. Dewey alone recov-
ered, only by prodigious
efforts in Oregon a few
weeks later.
Years before that, in
1932, a much more astute
campaigner, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who had re-
ceived the nomination
three months earlier,
found Milwaukee on his
itinerary.
After several attempts
on his campaign train to
put together proposals
suited to Wisconsin's econ-
omy, wise advisers pre-
vailed upon him to say
nothing about dairy farm-
ing or inland waterways
and to praise the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, freedom
of speech and the La Fol-
lettes. Wisconsin loved
that.
But Roosevelt was a
smarter politician than
any of the present Demo-
cratic contenders.
Sen. Kennedy seems to
be quite familiar with his-
tory, especially that of the
departed great whom he
lauded in his "Profiles in
Courage." Perhaps he did
not know when he en-
tered the Wisconsin pri-
mary that there are ways
other than death to ter-
minate a political career.
If he did, his enthusias-
tic reception by audiences
elsewhere must have
blinded him to the perils
involved in entering Wis-
consin. In any event, he
is now having an inferno
of an experience.
Sen. Humphrey and
Kennedy are stumping the
state from side to side and
end to end. When on oc-
casion they are called to
Washington to vote on
something or other, their
troupers carry on for
them.
Harry Homewood, com-
petent reporter who has
spent considerable time in
this Wisconsin battle roy-
al, tells me that there are
three elements which may
determine the result.
It is first, Homewood
says, a battle of women.
There is Mrs. Kennedy,
who is beautiful, charm-
ing, educated and very
chic. The latter attribute
has very doubtful value
in rural Wisconsin towns.
There are three of the al-
ways loyal Kennedy sis-
ters, with plenty of charm
of their own. It is an em-
barrassment of charm.
Mrs. Humphrey, with a
sure instinct for Wis-
consin and Minnesota
ways, tours by her lone-
some. There are times
when one woman is better
than four, especially when
she knows her way
around.
It is inevitably and re-
grettably a battle in which
religious feelings cannot
be discounted. In their
private computations, poli-
ticians lay aside their pub-
lic protestations that re-
ligion must be kept out of
politics. They are anxious-
ly adding up estimates of
Catholic vs. Lutheran vot-
ing potentials. In this, the
Humphrey country to the
north and west balances
or outweighs the south-
east.
Most important is the
personality of Humphrey
the evangelist. Until two
weeks ago, the smooth,
earnest Kennedy appeal
was catching on. But then
there came Hubert the
shouter, Hubert the mas-
ter of every forensic trick.
He has the first word, the
last word and thousands
in between.
Wisconsin people were
accustomed to that in the
years of the elder La Fol-
lette, who, according to his
foremost disciple, Wayne
Morse, "could hold con-
gregations of farmers un-
til the cattle were bellow-
ing for their suppers."
It is evangelism at its
most frenzied pitch: Hum-
phrey, the apostle of the
poor and the heavy laden.
In the midst of a speech
from the courthouse steps
there are loud "amens"
and "hosannas" from the
hearers.
This is whipping up an
opposition to the softer
approach of Kennedy. He
is no longer looking for a
smashing victory. A bare
majority will be welcome
to him. But such a blow
might well be fatal to his
aspirations.
