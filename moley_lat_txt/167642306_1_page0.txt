A very rusty remain-
der of my college course
in astronomy, plus a bit
of research, reveals that
one Roger Long, two cen-
turies ago, calculated that
the coincidence of the ris-
ing of Sirius, the Dog
Star, with the sun's ap-
pearance was at that time
about July 30.
Since his calculations
also indicated that in ear-
lier centuries the dates
of coincidence were ear-
lier, it may be that the
dread moment may now
be as far along as Aug. 8.
Thus, we may fix the be-
ginning of what have
come to be known in the
language as the dog days.
There are fearful con-
notations of what may
happen in that period.
Webster says it is a "pe-
riod of malignant influenc-
es." Dogs are most likely
to go mad. A pall of hot
humid air hangs over us.
Those who can, vacate.
Those who can't, suffo-
cate. And of all places to
experience the truly
"malignant influence" of
the time, Washington is
most dreadful.

Considering everything,
and not excluding air con-
ditioning, we can expect
nothing but woeful things
to happen when the "Con-
gress meets for a "clean-
up" period at that time.
The people most likely to
be cleaned up will be
those of us who must
meet the tax collectors
later.
But our legislators, or
a majority thereof, have
no such fate to fear. To
extend the astronomical
parallel further, the har-
vest moon is to come
this year about the time
the lawmakers finish
"cleaning up," Sept. 5.
The harvest is for a
grim, solitary reaper, the
President, to sign or veto.
And later, on Oct. 4,
there will be the hunt-
er's moon, when the same
legislators are madly pur-
suing their quarry, the
voters.
A number of the most
important and expensive
measures ever to come
before Congress are left
to the frenzied meeting of
this encore session. Med-
ical care for the needy
aged, if attached to the
social security tax, would
torture social security out
of its "insurance" nature
and into a levy to pay a
limitless sum for an inde-
terminate number of peo-
ple.
Federal aid for school
construction would change
a principle as old as the
nation, that states and
communities build their
own schools.
There is also our old
tax-eater, the pork-barrel
rivers and harbors author-
ization. This is and always
has been a catch-all for a
multitude of local im-
provements. It is fortu-
nately an authorization,
not an appropriation.
Thus, it is a "hunting li-
cense for an appropria-
tion." But it represents
fiscal irresponsibility at its
worst.

Then there is the infla-
tionary and discriminatory
minimum wage bill.
The political atmos-
phere is already full of
fine sentiments of "na-
tional purpose," sacrifice,
strength, and concern for
the nation first.
All the candidates are
for those things, in print
or vocally. But they have
already and will continue
to lead their supporters in
Congress to loot the
Treasury for money to ap-
pease minority groups, lo-
cal demands, and inde-
finable handouts.
The extra weeks of the
dog days' sessions will
have more of that sort of
voting, along with windy
shouts for national secu-
rity. But there can be no
security if the credit of
the United States is en-
dangered.
Tulsa and Catoosa must
have the muddy Arkansas
dredged so that they can
become seaports while
the railroads are begging
for business or money to
save them from bankrupt-
cy. The NEA must be
helped to nationalize the
schools. Old folks' groups
must be wooed. Labor
unions must be satisfied.
Public power groups have
votes and immense propa-
ganda machines to help
obedient members. And so
on.
President Eisenhower
is our last hope. He can
wield the veto power.
And if he does it effec-
tively and makes his
meaning clear, it is to be
hoped that the taxpayers
will sustain him and those
members of Congress who
will try to stem the tide.
