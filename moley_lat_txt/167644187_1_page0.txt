RAYMOND MOLEY:
Socialism Rejected
by the Free World
The news from all over
the world tells of the
abandonment of the major
tenets of socialism by its
more perceptive leaders.
Perhaps some of them,
having become practical
politicians, have been
taught a hard lesson by
the once-despised prole-
tariat in elections. Others,
seeing the failures of so
many socialist experi-
ments, have enough intel-
ligence to reject its as-
sumptions. Others are re-
pelled by the cruel fact
that where common own-
ership still flourishes it
needs the iron authority of
a dictatorship.

Hugh Gaitskell is a well-
educated man, as well as a
politician with years of
experience. Following the
third successive defeat of
his party and the fourth
stunning setback—for in
1950 the Socialists won
only by a short neck—he
proposed in December
that the party abandon the
major principle of social-
ism—nationalization. The
very serious illness of
Aneurin Bevan has pro-
vided an excuse for delay-
ing party consideration of
Gaitskell's proposed revi-
sion of the party constitu-
tion.
In Japan, Suehiro Ni-
shio, the most intelligent
and practical leader in the
Social Democratic Party,
has broken off completely
and has organized a new
party called Democratic
Socialist. Fifty-four mem-
bers of the Diet have
joined the new group.
The influence of the vi-
cissitudes of British social-
ism on Nishio and his fol-
lowers is considerable. The
arguments of Nishio are
not unlike those of Gait-
skell. In both cases the ev-
idence is clear that the es-
sence—or, as G. B. Shaw
would say, the "quintes-
sence"—of socialism has
been discarded.

Last spring, before the
Japanese elections, I had
a three-hour interview
with Nishio. Sensing his
familiarity with British ex-
perience, I arranged my
questions to cover the
many precepts of the Brit-
ish Labor Party.
While he said he was
still a Marxist, his ideas
about what ought to be na-
tionalized were very mild
indeed. He said he would
favor the nationalizing
only of electric power and
the national bank. So far
as agriculture, steel and
other industries were con-
cerned, he was for free en-
terprise.
In West Germany the
Socialists have thrown up
the sponge. These are the
heirs of the socialist move-
ment there which was
strong enough 75 years
ago to move the iron-
willed Bismarck to intro-
duce the welfare state.

Some of Shaw's plays
have appeared on televi-
sion recently, and to minds
acquainted with the facts
of 1960 they are quaint
exercises in diction. They
seem to summon up the
shade of Harold Laski,
pompously sitting among
a lot of sophomores back
in the 1920s on one of his
lecture tours to our col-
leges at that time. Even
Clement Attlee's essays in
the London Observer sug-
gest doubts in that theo-
retical mind.
Socialism is actually
only about 135 years old.
A kindly but crackpot
Englishman, Robert Owen,
who had accumulated a
fortune in the capitalist
civilization which followed
Adam Smith, came over
here and set up his scheme
in Indiana. It was a flop.
Later, Karl Marx, who
knew little of the realities
of economics and less of
human nature, established
a system out of pure dia-
lectic.

Max Eastman says that
"Marx made his 'proof' so
comprehensive and
so cloudy, bound up so
much true science with
the romantic metaphysics
out of which it was con-
cocted . . ." that he was
convinced that what had
failed in Indiana was in-
evitably coming true all
over the world.
But Britain has tried it
on a national scale and
the voters have seen it as
a delusion. In Communist
countries it has been sup-
planted by the oldest form
of government in the
world, brutal tyranny.
Only here in the United
States is its substance em-
braced by national plan-
ners, including senators
such as Proxmire, Morse
and Kefauver. But even
these avoid using the name
"socialism" for what they
are trying to build into na-
tional policy.
