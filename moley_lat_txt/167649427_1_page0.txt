RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Political Uses
of Phony Statistics
Don't try to pronounce
the word "statisticula-
tion." It is derived from a
funny book which de-
serves a place among the
useful classics of these
times, Darrell Huff's
"How to Lie With Statis-
tics." It isn't necessary to
falsify figures. It's a mat-
ter of selection and ar-
rangement.
As a mine of goodies for
orators supporting that
still nameless Democratic
candidate, Prof. Paul
Douglas' Joint Economic
Committee of Congress
has prepared a 72-page re-
port.
Without bothering about
all the economic gibber-
ish in the report, I select
one tiny table for consid-
eration, and out of this
tiny table only one col-
umn of figures. This table
is very important, for its
content will be one of the
major issues in 1960.
It gives the rate of
growth of the gross na-
tional product, known to
one and all as the GNP
and itself as phony a cal-
culation as a gangster's in-
come tax return. For all
you have to do to produce
any given GNP is to print
enough money.
The comparisons are
based upon "constant 1958
dollars."
For the period 1890-1959
the rate of GNP growth
was 3.2%; for 1890-1919,
3.5%; for 1919-1959, 2.9%;
for 1919-1947, 2.6%; for
1947-1953, 4.6%; for 1953-
1959 2.3%.
There is a note that
1959 dollars were used to
calculate the last, because
if 1958 dollars had been
used, the per cent would
have been 2.4. That would
have destroyed the nice
comparison between the
Truman and the Eisen-
hower years which, as you
see, shows that under the
former the rate of growth
was twice that of the lat-
ter.
*
The Truman-Eisenhow-
er comparison is what
Prof. Douglas was prepar-
ing as a nice nugget for
his party's orators. They
might have trouble re-
membering figures, but
who could not say "twice
as great" without looking
at his cuffs? The profes-
sor's figures were eager-
ly seized by the AFL-CIO
News, which flared head-
lines about Ike's "slow-
down policies."
But the Truman years
consisted of four years of
peace and three years of
rearmament, including the
Korean war years. If the
professor had taken the
four years of Truman
peace, no growth at all
would have been shown,
but rather a decline of
2.2%.
Thus, if we should want
to statisticulate further,
we could show that the
Truman peace was far
worse than the Eisenhow-
er peace. But that would
be overlooking the fact
that rearmament had to
continue after the Korean
war.
*
Why on earth the years
were selected for group-
ing as they were prior to
1947 is past understand-
ing. In other regroupings,
quite amazing arguments
might have been made for
Republican years. But
why go on with this num-
bers game?
We shall hear a lot of
talk about the relatively
faster rate of growth in
Russia as compared with
our own. That bit of ly-
ing with statistics is done
by using a different sort
of base from which to
start.
A year ago my col-
league, Henry Hazlitt, in
two articles in Newsweek,
thoroughly exposed this
"growth" game.
*
So far as relative
growth is concerned, he
cited the rate of growth
of our television industry.
Between 1946 and 1947
the rate of growth of sets
sold was 2,757%, with an
increase in sets of only
193,000. Since 1950 the
rate of growth has been
zero, but we are turning
out from 5 million to 7
million sets a year.
The boy in the third
grade can say proudly to
his brother who is 19 that
his rate of growth is tre-
mendous by comparison.
The 19-year-old young
man will answer that
when he gets a baby, its
growth will be 195% in
its first year.
Prof. Paul Douglas had
the best economic educa-
tion obtainable, together
with 14 honorary doctor-
ates. It is a pity to see
all this used to frustrate,
rather than to advance,
the enlightenment of the
public.
