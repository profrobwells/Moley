Among some New York
Republicans, who never
liked Vice President Nix-
on at any time, there is
considerable talk about
how the steel companies
were "sold out" in the re-
cent settlement of the steel
disnute.
Democrats will be the
beneficiaries of this sort
of talk, although none of
the Democratic candidates
will endanger their as-
sured labor support by
saying that labor won a
big victory. What they say
instead is that the Presi-
dent should have prevent-
ed the strike before it
started.

Certain junior execu-
tives of one or two steel
companies are complain-
ing bitterly of being
"forced" into a settlement.
This is a normal bit of
self-protection, because if
prices go up they can
blame Nixon rather than
the companies for settling
as they did.
It is also true that the
failure to come to a final
agreement on the feather-
bedding issue will make it
harder for many smaller
industries to rid them-
selves of that grave source
of inflation. It was also
normal that the union
bosses should have hailed
the settlement as a great
labor victory.
But a review of the
facts and of the opinions
of steel executives of some
of the big companies since
the settlement does not
justify the blame attached
by some to the Vice Presi-
dent.

He himself, in a long
letter to the Syracuse
(N.Y.) Herald-Journal,
makes a good case for the
administration's action.
But the facts now dis-
closed by some of the com-
panies make an even
stronger case. It is a fact
that the companies knew
quite well that the vote of
the union members would
have favored the resump-
tion of the strike.
The chairman of the Re-
public Steel Co., Charles
M. White, has thrown a
new light upon the settle-
ment issued recently: "The
settlement which ended
the long labor dispute was
on terms which are a great
deal better from our
standpoint than the public
has been led to believe.
"While we did not fully
attain our objectives . . .
we did, nevertheless, ma-
terially slow down the
rate of increase in our
labor costs."
He pointed out that for
the last 10 years employ-
ment costs have been in-
creasing at the rate of ap-
proximately 8% per year.
The recent settlement will
reduce the rate of increase
to 3.5 to 3.75% per year
during the life of the con-
tract.
"The settlement," he
continued, "is materially
better than the settle-
ments which might have
been imposed upon us
based upon recent agree-
ments negotiated by the
steelworkers' union with
the aluminum and can in-
dustries or with the Kai-
ser Steel Corp."
Those settlements
would have increased
"our employment costs
approximately 4.5 to 5%
if applied to the steel com-
panies, or nearly 30%
more than we actually
settled for."
★
White added that the
long-term contracts on
wages and pensions, in-
surance and supplemental
employment benefits
have "great value" to Re-
public, "for they enable
us to plan our operations
and our capital improve-
ment programs with full
knowledge of our employ-
ment costs, which consti-
tute more than one-third
of our total costs of pro-
duction."
It should be added that
Republic is the third larg-
est producer of steel, with
United States Steel and
Bethlehem ranking first
and second. It has been a
rapidly growing company
with good management
and many innovations in
its favor.
Its annual production
is almost as great as that
of France and half of
Great Britain. The "big
three" together produce
more than half of Ameri-
can steel. And Republic
has never been weak in
dealing with union de-
mands.
★
I might add also that if
some of those steel execu-
tives who are complaining
about the Nixon-Mitchell
settlement had been as
public-spirited in encour-
aging the political activi-
ties of their employees as
Republic has been, the
grim prospect offered by a
Congress largely dominat-
ed by members elected
with AFL-CIO COPE
would not have been pres-
ent in this session.
For the companies
would certainly have fared
badly if the issue had gone
to Congress.
