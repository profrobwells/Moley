RAYMOND MOLEY:
Americans Endorse
Defense Espionage
No one, not even a
thousand George Gallups,
should venture what the
considered opinion of the
American people may be
on any matter of impor-
tance.
The best judges of the
reaction to any event, is-
sue or public decision are
those who, after many
years of experience in pub-
lic affairs, have so iden-
tified themselves with av-
erage Americans as to re-
flect public opinion from
their own sense of right or
wrong or practical.
*
Many members of Con-
gress have this capacity.
So do experienced editors
and other newspapermen
who are not too close to
the Washington atmos-
phere, which is colored so
much by representatives
of European countries res-
ident there.
If we take British of-
ficial opinion as an exam-
ple, there can be no doubt
about the reaction to the
U-2 episode. The leaders
of both political parties
there have immense con-
fidence in summit meet-
ings.
Five years ago this
month I was in England
reporting the general elec-
tion. In the midst of the
debate President Eisen-
hower announced his sup-
port of a summit meeting.
There is no doubt what-
ever that this made many
Conservative votes, for
that party was in power
and had made a summit
meeting a major promise.
★
This Conservative ap-
peal far outdistanced the
rather vague appeals of
Labor for an end to nu-
clear testing. The same
feeling prevailed last Oc-
tober when I was there
again. Macmillan got plen-
ty of mileage from the
claim that he was best
able to get concessions
from both the Soviets and
the United States.
British opinion has great
influence on our eastern
seaboard and in Washing-
ton and, while the British
government has been en-
gaged in all sorts of espi-
onage since long before
Columbus discovered
America, it deplores the
present spy incident. Pos-
sibly this is because we
were caught. Also, be-
cause we timed things
wrong. Also, because we
were frank in admitting it.
But over the country, I
believe, most Americans
approach the Soviet prob-
lem from a quite different
point of view. Revelations
of Soviet rascality, includ-
ing their persistent med-
dling in our affairs here,
have changed our reaction
toward what we would
once have regarded as a
breach of our idealistic
policies.
Moreover, Americans
generally are heartily sick
of Khrushchev's bluster
and threats. We are sorry
that Powers had the ill
luck of mechanical trou-
ble which resulted in his
capture, but we are also
glad that our government
has been meeting the So-
viet on its own terms. We
want to know as much
about Russian strength as
they know about ours.
*
This deeply embedded
American view was well
reflected by Sen. Johnson
of Texas and Rep. Cannon
of Missouri. They made
no apologies. They hurled
the challenge back at
Khrushchev. And Can-
non made clear that the
practice of reconnaissance
flights over the last four
years, as well as this par-
ticular flight, had been re-
ported regularly to his
subcommittee.
In short, as politicians
who have proved their
skill in many elections,
they were warning their
Democratic Party to make
no mistake about its peril
in trying to win votes on
this issue.
Adlai Stevenson, how-
ever, deplores with alarm.
He says that we should no
longer engage in "tribal
feuding." We are exhort-
ed to set an example of in-
nocence and purity.
★
We have been setting
that example over many
years. We indicated it in
two world wars from
which we gained nothing
but the ingratitude of
Communists, Stevenson is
not seeking political ad-
vantage, he says. But his
position on this issue be-
lies that. And he is as
greatly mistaken as he was
in 1956 when he advocated
our unilateral abandon-
ment of nuclear tests as a
last desperate appeal in
the campaign. He is as
mistaken now as he was
then.
The overriding responsi-
bility of the President is to
see to it that we are safe
from surprise attack and
destruction by an avowed
enemy.
This responsibility he
has accepted. Americans
agree with him.
