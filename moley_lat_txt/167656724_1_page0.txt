RAYMOND MOLEY:
Health of Aspirants
a Legitimate Issue
It is most unfortunate
that the question of health
has been thrown so sensa-
tionally into public notice
only a few days before
the Democratic conven-
tion.
These revelations have
been made with little time
in which the delegates
might have the opportuni-
ty to have a wholly im-
partial group of scientists
and physicians place the
true facts before them.
For theirs is a very
great responsibility not
only to the Democratic
Party, which wants to win,
but to the nation, which
wants to hire a man for a
supremely grave respon-
sibility.
The facts stated by Sens.
Kennedy and Johnson
have been known to many
people for a long time. But
no commentator or edito-
rial writer has felt like re-
vealing them because
there would immediately
be a cry of "dirty, despi-
cable" politics.
On the record, it was
Kennedy who provoked
the counterattack against
himself. He said, "Four of
the seven Presidents (in
my lifetime) have suffered
major health setbacks that
impaired, at least tempo-
rarily, their exercise of ex-
ecutive leadership... but
a President is elected for
four years or possibly
eight years and the
voters deserve to know
that his health and vigor
will remain at the helm."
*
That could not have
been interpreted except as
a count against Johnson,
who, as every newspaper
reader knew at the time,
suffered a heart attack in
1955.
What Kennedy is quoted
above as saying is per-
fectly true. And since he
is so fond of history that
he cited instances of young,
successful men at the head
of affairs running back to
Alexander the Great, he
might have gone back be-
yond the Presidents he
mentioned.
Wilson, the first of the
four incapacitated Presi-
dents he noted, had a
doubtful health diagnosis
before he was nominated
in 1912. In 1929, Dr. Searle
Harris of Birmingham,
Ala., revealed that fact in
an address before the
Medical Society of Vir-
ginia. (His statement is in
the Virginia Medical
Monthly, January, 1929.)
Dr. Harris said that
when he saw and heard
Wilson in 1911 "we feared
that he would not have the
physical strength to live
through even one term as
President." That "was
later confirmed by infor-
mation obtained from
confidential conversations
with his physician, Adm.
Grayson."
In the first years of his
Presidency, Wilson lived
according to a strict regi-
men prescribed by Dr.
Grayson, but later the na-
tion paid dearly. There
were 18 months of practi-
cally complete prostration.
â˜…
After President Roose-
velt was nominated in
1944, speakers putting
various candidates for
Vice President before the
convention filled the air
with suggestions that the
man named for Vice Presi-
dent should be not only
wise but rugged and
healthy. No one could mis-
understand the fact that
the President's weak
health was inferred.
Since mentioning health
was likely to meet vilifica-
tion and abuse, I merely
wrote at that time a piece
showing that the Presi-
dents before Lincoln had
lived an average of 71
years. After Lincoln, the
average was only 63 years.
President Roosevelt died
at 63. The average will be
higher now, because of the
ruggedness of Messrs. Hoo-
ver and Truman. But the
fact is that, despite the
general expectancy of
many more years, Presi-
dents live shorter lives
than most men.

The secrecy which sur-
rounds a President's health
was shown in Cleveland's
second term when he was
taken on a yacht for an op-
eration for cancer of the
jaw. It was not revealed
at the time.
Back before Lincoln, two
Presidents-Harrison and
Taylor-lived only a few
months. It is not exactly
on the point to add that
with proper surgical care
McKinley might have sur-
vived in 1901 and that
there is a bare possibility
that a modern brain sur-
geon might have spared
Lincoln's life.
The issue is vital and
should no longer be left
to ex parte statements and
family doctors.
