Our Dedicated Teachers Deserve
Our Respect and Our Gratitude
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Somehow, it seems to
me, the public's image of
the teacher and of the in-
comparably valuable pro-
fession which he or she
represents has been tar-
nished by some of the ar-
guments made for improv-
ing the teacher's econom-
ic and professional status.
Some statements of fact
embodied in those argu-
ments are undeniably
true, some are at least ar-
guable, some require fur-
ther substantiation. Some
remedies proposed would
not help solve such prob-
lems as exist.

The Grand Street Boys'
Assn. in New York, a
group which numbers in
its membership some of
the fine and successful
citizens of the city, has
decided, without necessar-
ily getting into the cur-
rent arguments about ed-
ucation, to clarify the fine
image of the teacher and
the teaching profession by
a signal recognition of a
selected number of ded-
icated teachers in the
New York school system.
Their plan might very
usefully be adopted by
parent-teacher organiza-
tions or other civic groups
in other cities. If per-
chance this article strikes
the attention of anyone
interested, he or she
might get the details from
the Grand Street Boys'
Assn. president, Judge
Jonah J. Goldstein, at the
association's headquarters
at 106 W. 55th St., New
York City.

Today the association is
tendering a luncheon in
honor of 100 dedicated
public-school teachers who
have been selected by
canvassing the PTAs,
principals, alumni and re-
tired teachers.
Each one of the 100 will
receive an illuminated
scroll, and each of the
foremost 10 will receive
an award of $500. The
members of the Board of
Education will not be in-
vited, because the associa-
tion does not want them
to think that these awards
in any sense suggest that
such a bestowal of honors
should take the place of
increased pay or better
working conditions.
Such dedicated teach-
ers—and there are such
public servants in every
school system—rank with
the most significant in-
dividuals in our civilization.
They have labored over
many years, never for
glory or ostentatious hon-
ors, because they love
teaching and are richly
rewarded in the love of
inspired pupils. They are
the Mr. and Miss Chipses
in our midst.
I have a special reason
for knowing of their sig-
nificance, since at the age
of 26 I became a very
junior and unimportant
member of a big city high
school faculty. It was a
priceless gift to me as a
beginner to get the
knowledge and inspiration
of some of these col-
leagues, at least a dozen
of whom had been teach-
ing there before I was
born.

I realized how green
and unripe had been the
valley of my collegiate
studies and my preten-
tious reading. Here was
learning at its ripest and
richest. Here was the stuff
of life at its best. Here
were the indestructible
treasures of the past im-
parted by and illustrated
by those who were the
ministers of living truth.
These were and are in-
dispensable men and
women.
The least we can do is
to pay them our respect
and gratitude for what
they have done to help
save this generation.
