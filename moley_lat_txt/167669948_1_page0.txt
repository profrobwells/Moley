RAYMOND MOLEY:
N.Y. Democrats Let
Republicans 'Live'
In what follows I am referring to that part of
Greater New York City
which is commonly known
as Manhattan Island and
is officially New York
County.
Since two years after
the inauguration of President
Washington it has
been the jealously guarded
hunting ground of
Tammany Hall.
Each of the other four
counties in Greater New
York has its own Democratic
organization. In
1959 New York County
fell in population below
Kings (Brooklyn) and
Queens. But the Tammany
head is still powerful
in city affairs, and
Mayor Wagner is a native
of the island.
★
To some degree the political
conditions which I
shall describe are the
same in the Bronx and, to
a somewhat lesser degree,
in Kings. Only in Queens
and Richmond (Staten Island)
are there real two-
party systems.
A feeble Republican organization
exists in Manhattan
and duly elects the
official party leaders prescribed
by law for any
party — a county committee,
Assembly district
leaders and coleaders
(mostly women) and certain
formal officers who
serve under a county
leader elected by the Assembly
leaders.
Several years of rather
intimate association with
politics in the county have
taught me what happens
to a minority party and
how it manages to live at
all. Broadly speaking, it
lives because it is to the
interest of Tammany to
keep it alive.
★
Why? Because, if there
were no Republican organization
and thus no
campaigns each year
against an opposition party,
Tammany would be
riven by internal feuds
and factions. It has some
of that now in the shape
of a group headed by ex-
Sen. and ex-Gov. Herbert
Lehman and Mrs. Roosevelt,
who want to unseat
Carmine De Sapio as leader.
There is also a splinter
Liberal Party which needs
appeasing.
But with a rallying cry
against really harmless
Republicans, some sort of
unity and discipline can
be managed. This year
Tammany can be rallied
for some Democratic Presidential
candidate; next
year, against a hopeless
Republican candidate for
mayor.
How is the Republican
Party kept in line? In the
first place, there is the exceedingly
unreliable Republican
Party membership. There are plenty of
potential Republicans in
New York County but
many of them have voting
residences in New
Jersey, Connecticut or
Long Island. They work
and live during the week
in town but vote and,
what is most important,
pay less in taxes out of
town.
Those who live in city
apartments have been exceedingly
mobile in recent
years because of the appearance
of immense new
apartment buildings.
Neighbors know little of
each other. There is no
community unity. Many
people of substance maintain
a nominal Democratic
registration because it is
good for their businesses.
To mobilize these would
be a Herculean task.
★
Great masses of votes
are controlled, especially
among the Puerto Ricans
and Negroes. Congressman-Baptist
minister Powell
is king of Harlem.
Tammany allows the
Republicans to have one
of the six congressmen in
the county. Republicans
have two of the 16 state
Assembly seats. Only one
member of the city council
is a Republican, and
he is more radical than his
Democratic colleagues.
These legislators have
only nominal opposition
and are not disposed to
upset the balance that
keeps their jobs.
Tammany lets the Republican
Party have a
slice of patronage in the
form of occasional receiverships,
some business
from real estate, insurance,
banking and other
types of private enterprise
closely intertwined with
political favor.
★
The only real party
patronage a Republican
district leader has, aside
from the foregoing, is
the temporary Christmas
post-office jobs which are
tossed to election district
(precinct) captains or their
friends.
If a few idealistic people
decide to energize
themselves and seek to
elect a congressman or a
state assemblyman, the
Republican district leaders
put up a bristling
front of mutual jealousies
plus general indifference.
Idealism cannot live in
such a climate. That has
happened within the
month in one congressional
district.
This is how the two-
party system operates in
the great County of New
York. This is how democracy
"democs."
