RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nixon's TV Ordeal
Proves Him Worthy
The career of Richard
Nixon has shown a rare
sort of politician who nev-
er takes the politic and
easy course.
If two roads are open to
him — one tortuous, dan-
gerous, and long; the oth-
er easy to travel or to by-
pass — he will take the
hard way. It would almost
seem that he has for years
been deliberately harden-
ing himself for the office
to which he currently as-
pires.
He has had spots of
luck, such as the haphaz-
ard choice made by Gen.
Eisenhower when he was
chosen as a candidate for
Vice President. But once
in that office he declined
to exercise its pleasant pre-
rogatives and perquisites
of acting as a ceremonial
figure on occasions when
the President was other-
wise occupied.
Instead, he chose hard
assignments, kept in the
thick of policy making, de-
veloped an understanding
of an infinite variety of
governmental activities.
He knew there would be
trouble in Caracas on his
South American tour and
had a generous assortment
of friendly Latin-Ameri-
can neighbors to visit in-
stead. But he faced and en-
dured an unbelievably
savage personal physical
attack.
On Sunday evening in
New York in a television
interview he faced an
equally dangerous situa-
tion. It was not a peril
threatening his life but it
could have ended in dis-
astrous consequences to
his political future.
This assignment he free-
ly accepted and he came
through with great credit
to himself. Since the view-
ing audience was limited
to the New Jersey-New
York area, with only 15
stations participating else-
where, some explanation is
necessary here.
A television producer,
David Susskind, has a
show called Open End.
Apparently that means
that the questioning goes
on till I don't know when.
It begins at 10 in the eve-
ning and runs on until the
small hours of morning.
Sometimes there are a
number of participants,
but in the Nixon appear-
ance the only other was
Susskind as questioner.
According to one TV
critic, the interview ran
on until 2:30 a.m. Others
say 1:45 a.m. All I know
is that after keeping my
eyes open and my posture
erect I had to quit watch-
ing and listening at 1 a.m.
because of utter exhaus-
tion. At that time Suss-
kind had reached only the
middle of the three fields
he planned to cover.
As to Susskind, I offer
the characterization of an
able and courageous tele-
vision critic, Jack O'Brian
of the New York Journal-
American: "A young
man yearning anxiously
— nay feverishly — in so
many directions...climb-
ing hard with an alpen-
stock, a professed Steven-
sonian Democrat..."
His questions were often
loaded with his own pre-
conceptions and "facts"
to fit his ultra-"liberal"
philosophy and were never
friendly but always de-
signed to embarrass and
humiliate the guest.
Nixon was not unaware
that this was the sort of
grilling to which he would
be subjected. But he ap-
parently felt that this was
the sort of tough situation
he needed to reveal to his
audience his capacity to
take it.
The grilling on the U-2
spy case and the decision
of the President to resume
underground nuclear tests
took two hours. Nixon sat
uncomfortably (it seemed)
on a hard, upright chair
while his adversary
squirmed, smoked, drank
coffee and fired incessant-
ly from prepared ques-
tions. Mike Wallace in his
earlier and more aggres-
sive days was a gentle
shepherd compared with
the Susskind of last Sun-
day night.
Nixon, never losing his
composure or descending
to wisecracks, took it all
most seriously and ex-
plained in his answers al-
most all of the complica-
tions of the foreign policy
which has governed the
administration in dealing
with the Soviet Union.
This performance as a
preview of Nixon's capac-
ity to work under fire
should be ample notice to
any present Democratic
candidate that if he is
nominated in July he will
have a tough road from
then to November.
