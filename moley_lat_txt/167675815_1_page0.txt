Big Election Day Turnout Means
True Representative Government
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
My answer to the old
question whether a big
turnout on election day
is important is a positive
affirmative, even after con-
sidering the doubtful en-
lightenment of the mil-
lions who generally ab-
stain.
That is why the tremen-
dous get-out-the-vote ef-
fort of the Rexall Drug Co.
and many co-operating
groups and companies is
so important. A bit of ex-
planation of this opinion
is in order.
Without the strong sup-
port of the labor unions,
the Democratic Party
would be in the minority.
A few statistics show this
to be true.
*
Until the entrance of the
unions into politics 25
years ago, the aggregate of
the vote turned out at
Presidential elections in-
creased roughly with the
population. Except in un-
usual years, the Demo-
cratic Party was in a mi-
nority.
But beginning with
1940, the two parties have
been running at the same
relative level except in
the Eisenhower turnout in
1952 and 1956 which was
created by the personality
of the candidate.
The Democratic vote in
the five Presidential elec-
tions beginning with 1940
has been, in millions, 27,
25.5, 26, 27, 26. The Repub-
lican vote in the first three
of these was almost ex-
actly the same â€” 22 mil-
lion.
The difference of 4 or 5
million between the par-
ties has been almost en-
tirely due to the drive,
skilled organization and
money of the unions. This
was anticipated by two of
the smartest politicians of
our time, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Edward J.
Flynn, his closest and
shrewdest political lieu-
tenant.
Both of these told me in
1935 that unless the Dem-
ocratic Party got some sort
of auxiliary help it would
decline once more into a
minority status. That is the
main reason why the
Roosevelt administration
did so much to encourage
not only bigger unions un-
der the Wagner Act but
labor in politics.
But while the two par-
ties have remained on a
dead level in the last 20
years, the eligible vote has
increased by what I would
estimate at 20 million.
These, along with some-
where near 20 million
more, are the sleeping
electorate.
*
Thus, a small vote em-
phasizes the importance of
minorities, many of them
with something to gain at
the expense of the great
majority of the taxpayers
of the nation. A minority
vote of the whole elector-
ate means minority pow-
er.
I am not saying that so
long as they stay within
the law the unions should
not try to get out their vote
and influence. What is
needed is that everybody
get into the act.
That is what Rexall and
such organizations and
companies as they can in-
fluence are aiming for in
driving for a big turnout
next November. The Amer-
ican Legion with its 17,000
posts is co-operating. Also,
the powerful coverage of
the Coca-Cola Co. is lend-
ing aid. Rexall alone has
10,000 outlets scattered all
over the nation. Savings
and loan banks, 6,600 in
number, are following the
Rexall plan.
Much credit for this
great effort to remind peo-
ple of their duty to vote
and to instruct them about
registration and voting
should go to Justin Dart,
chairman of the Rexall
Drug & Chemical Co., and
to John Bowles, president
of Rexall Drug Co.
*
Mr. Dart has never hesi-
tated to urge businessmen
to participate in politics,
and he has shown a good
example by his own per-
sonal activity. Mr. Bowles
is throwing missionary
spirit into this get-out-the-
vote drive, traveling over
the country, urging other
businesses to participate,
and instructing the thou-
sands of employees of the
company in methods of
arousing interest in the
coming election. This is
strictly an unpartisan af-
fair. Everyone is urged to
vote, regardless of party
preference.
It should always be re-
membered that people who
are running for office are
influenced by the elector-
ate they have to face. If
that electorate should be,
say, 80 million rather than
about 50 million, the can-
didates would make their
appeals more truly nation-
al. Minorities would have
less influence. And we all
would benefit.
