Assumption That Democrats Are
in Majority Needs Qualification

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

We are already getting,
in dispatches and commentaries from Washington,
D.C., and New York, two
assertions which need contradiction or qualification
before readers and hearers
accept them as facts. One
is that the Republican
Party is a minority, and
the other is that a Republican
candidate must direct
his appeal primarily
toward "Democrats and
independents" in order to
win.

These are, at the best,
those dangerous half-
truths which can lose
rather than win the election
for a Republican candidate. And they have in
the last 20 years lost three
elections—one for Willkie,
and two for Dewey.

It was recently asserted
in a number of dispatches
that the Republican national
headquarters in
Washington had issued a
statement that Democrats
outnumber Republicans
by three to two.

To make that statement
is good campaign strategy.
Technically it is true,
especially when it is based
upon the disastrous year,
1958. It is intended to
spur local organizations to
greater efforts.

But the wise man who
was from 1952 to 1959
campaign director of the
Republican National Committee, Robert Humphreys,
pointed out the
danger of accepting this
sort of estimate without
adding certain facts. He
said that it is true that
generally the total vote for
Democratic candidates for
the House of Representatives is higher than that
cast for Republican candidates. But there are from
70 to 80 districts, mostly in
the South, in which there

is no Republican opposition. Also, where there is
opposition, it is only nominal.

Humphreys proved that
if these districts were
eliminated, the Republican
vote would be considerably higher than the
Democratic vote. There are
also gerrymandered districts
everywhere in the
states outside the South
in which opposition is only
nominal. Some of these
are Republican; others,
Democratic.

Moreover, in the past
five Presidential elections
there were strong citizen’s
organizations working
only for the Presidential
candidate on the Republican ticket. "Citizens for
Willkie" was an example.
That sort of appeal is a direct invitation to split the
ticket. Because of it, candidates for Congress and
the state Legislatures are
forgotten, and their vote
slumps below that of the
head of the ticket.

Nixon well knows that
danger, and such groups
will be more tightly bound
to the Republican organization this year. The
soundest political strategy
is to work hard to get out
votes for the little fellows
on the ticket first. Then
every extra vote gotten out
will go to the head of the
ticket, too.

It must be noted that
there is nothing but the
name Democrat to relate
most of the congressmen
from uncontested districts
in the South to the majority that wrote the platform and selected the candidate at Los Angeles. Nixon’s appeal to those conservative voters will be
very strong indeed, and
the result will be apparent
in the election.

Another circumstance
which gives the Democratic
Party a technical majority
is in the registration
figures. These are meaningless in terms of real
preferences. This is especially true of the three
states I have visited during the past three weeks—
California, Oregon, and
Washington. Party ties are
loose in these states. People register according to
their past traditions or by
habit. But in the elections
in all three states, Republican governors have been
generally elected over the
past 20 years.

*

The important fact
which needs clarification
by the candidates this year
is that the Democratic
Party has been transformed since President
Roosevelt was first elected
28 years ago. It stands for
the exact opposite from
what it advocated before
that.

The whole voting population is now in a state of
flux, seeking new moorings
and new party affiliations.
If, as is possible, Nixon
proves wiser than Dewey
and Willkie, he will seek to
align with his party the
millions who cannot subscribe to the radical sentiments dominant at Los
Angeles.

With that sort of appeal,
with his firm belief in
building up the strength
of his party at the local
level, we may see a real realignment of the two parties, with either fairly
equal strength or a Republican majority. But to assume that all Democrats
are radical and to make
a radical appeal would lose
conservatives under both
party names.
