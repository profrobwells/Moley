RAYMOND MOLEY:
Connally Amendment
Senate Fight Looms
The forces favoring or
opposing the repeal of the
Connally amendment are
gathering for a fight in the
Senate during the "turnip
time" session of Congress
in August.
A committee of lawyers
has been formed under
New York auspices with
the venerable former
Judge Learned Hand as
chairman. An opposing
group is under the chair-
manship of Frank E. Hol-
man, former president of
the American Bar Assn.

Propaganda is already
appearing in the press
through letters to the edi-
tor, and editorials are
placed in the Congression-
al Record. The people fa-
voring the repeal have
seized upon certain recent
events to support them,
such as the U-2 affair, the
Castro troubles, and now
the shooting down of an
American military plane
in the Arctic.
After the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee decided
to shelve the issue for the
remainder of this Con-
gress, it arose in another
form. Certain "conven-
tions" and a "protocol"
having to do with the law
of the sea came up requir-
ing Senate confirmation
and the force of a treaty.
Included in the matters
dealt with were territorial
waters.
This alerted some sena-
tors, including Russell
Long of Louisiana.

Their concern is to pro-
tect the interests of states
in the mineral rights of
coastal waters. Since the
"conventions" and "proto-
col" would bind the Unit-
ed States without reserva-
tions to the compulsory
jurisdiction of the World
Court, the passage would,
in effect, so far as the sub-
jects involved are con-
cerned, negate the Connal-
ly reservation. Thus the
advocates of repeal will be
most happy to accomplish
their purpose piecemeal.
Accordingly, Sen. Long
on July 5 offered reserva-
tions to the various con-
ventions similar to the
Connally reservation. They
would, if attached to the
conventions, reserve to
the United States the de-
termination of what mat-
ters would properly be
within the domestic con-
cern of the United States
and not be subject to the
compulsory jurisdiction of
a 15-judge court, on which
the United States has only
one member and the Com-
munists two. There the
subject rested when Con-
gress recessed.
This shows how neces-
sary it is to maintain res-
ervations on every subject
which involves interna-
tional conventions and
treaties.
★
This is especially true
when we consider the ex-
travagant claims made
concerning the recent
events noted above. Sen.
Jacob Javits of New York
suggested that the United
States could, if it were rid
of the Connally amend-
ment, drag Cuba into the
World Court and cited an
editorial in the New York
Times as his authority.
That is simply not accu-
rate. For Cuba has never
declared her adherence to
the court, with or without
reservations.
The Javits speech
reached the height of ab-
surdity when he suggest-
ed that if we did not have
the Connally amendment
"it would have helped us
enormously in respect to
the difficulties about the
U-2."
Since the Soviet has not
agreed to the compulsory
jurisdiction of the World
Court, we could not pos-
sibly have brought it be-
fore the court. Nor could
we do so in connection
with the shooting down of
our plane in the Arctic.
★
Misrepresentation seems
to be the order of the day
in attempting to whittle
away our sovereignty by
action of the Senate. This
sort of unilateral legal dis-
armament is almost as per-
ilous as unilateral military
disarmament in the trou-
bled world in which we
are living. But there is a
great danger of such legal
folly in the dog-day ses-
sion in August.
