RAYMOND MOLEY:
Small Plants Stifled
on Defense Contracts
Thousands of small, ef-
ficient operations are at
the heart of our fabulous
and unparalleled system.
A great many of them
might very well contrib-
ute immeasurably to the
defense effort. They will
not.
For defense procure-
ment is a chaos of de-
clared policies which can-
not be reconciled with ex-
isting practices. Small
manufacturing con-
cerns fear for what they
may lose in money, time,
know-how, and skills in
such a jungle.
Suppose a small engi-
neering firm devises an
ingenious part for a mis-
sile. Under regulations
this firm must give up its
drawings. There is a good
possibility that they will
eventually be used by the
Department of Defense to
shop around among com-
petitors for other firms
that will produce the part
at a lower price. This is
one of the perilous
chances.
Denham Scott of the
Garrett Corp., a Los An-
geles aircraft and missile
components manufacturer,
has given some startling
testimony to Congress on
this complex subject.
The small-business man
who has products of his
own design to offer has
reason for loud com-
plaints. He must "dig into
his own pocket" to finance
the sales promotion and
the brainwork necessary
to design, produce, test,
and refine a product.
"The popular misconcep-
tion that the government
pays for all of the devel-
opment in weapons sys-
tems and other programs
is a monumental fiction,"
Scott says.
The small subcontractor
is low man on the totem
pole, beneath prime con-
tractors and their subcon-
tractors. He is faced by a
maze of "weirdly assorted"
contractual documents
that reveal that he can
negotiate only with his di-
rect purchaser who, in
turn, is restricted by
terms of his own contract.
Scott shows, among oth-
er things, how the Depart-
ment of Defense and its
service branches define
"proprietary data" so that
much of what is ordinarily
and by common law rec-
ognized as being a trade
secret and therefore pro-
prietary has been brushed
aside.
Two regulations serious-
ly disturb these small busi-
nesses. The first tells
them that they must pre-
pare a complete set of
technical data suitable for
manufacture by others;
the other, that if the gov-
ernment determines from
an examination of their
drawings and process
specifications that their
design and know-how
are discoverable by the
process of "reverse engi-
neering," it will brand
their operation "nonpro-
prietary." In practice, no-
one need go through the
motions of "reverse engi-
neering." The drawings
are simply handed over.
Scott observes, "It is ob-
vious that with modern
chemistry and metallurgy
virtually all compositions
of matter can be broken
down; similarly, if enough
pieces are measured and
probability theories ap-
plied, tolerances can be de-
termined. The Depart-
ment of Defense, there-
fore, is using a unique
definition and practice
which disposes of the prob-
lem of proprietary rights
by disclaiming them as
virtually nonexistent."
Congress now has be-
fore it a good many bills
dealing with defense pro-
curement that might
change these conditions
and others and thus short-
en our time between
"ideas and hardware."
But we are pounded by
the utterances of those al-
ready seeking public of-
fice or preparing to run
this coming fall. More
spending, they say, is the
only solution to our de-
fense shortcomings. Sig-
nificant facts such as
those which Scott points
up go unnoticed in the
din.
Big business and indus-
try and their subcontrac-
tors have some, but only
a share, of this country's
talents and inventive
brains. Too many of our
small enterprises with
their share of the best tal-
ent—managerial, engi-
neering, and otherwise—
simply will not gamble for
the defense dollar. And
our defenses are the poor-
er because of it.
