Sen. Fulbright's U-2 Criticism
Adds Mud to the Muddy Waters

When an academician
turns politician a curious
twisting of his mentality
often takes place.
As a politician he is per-
fectly willing to take par-
tisan advantage of what-
ever seems to him salable
to the voting public. But
his academic mind pre-
vents him from a sound
judgment as to what the
public may or may not un-
derstand. He may offer a
technical point which ei-
ther has no validity or can-
not be explained.
An excellent example is
the position taken by Sen.
Fulbright in objecting to
the management of the
U-2 incident by the ad-
ministration. He had taken
that position before the
committee approved the
report and was able to get
the committee to approve
of it.

As a politician he ap-
parently decided that any
report which condemned
our spying operations
would not be popular. The
American people have
made it clear that since
we are in a war for sur-
vival and since the Soviet
has infested our country
with spies, we had better
do'some spying ourselves.
Moreover, since we must
be on the alert against sud-
den attack, we must de-
termine with some degree
of exactness the spots in
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Russia from which such
an attack might be
launched.
Also, in quibbling about
what officer in the State
Department or the Central
Intelligence Agency spoke
and then reversed himself
was not of substance con-
sidering the gravity of the
issue itself,
tell the truth and at the
same time not be involved
in the incident?
What the senator got
his partisan colleagues to
say in substance was that
the President should have
lied to the people. Or by
not saying anything, give
the impression that he was
afraid to tell the truth.
This is a dangerous stick
which the senator has
shaped to use in a cam-
paign.
But let us turn the case
around. Suppose the Presi-
dent had said that he had
never heard of the U-2
business? Then the opposi-
tion, probably including
the senator, would have
said, "Here are some gov-
ernment airships flying
over another country tak-
ing pictures and the. Pres-
ident is either playing golf
or he is kept in ignorance
by his high officials about a
matter of transcendent im-
portance involving our re-
lations with other na-
tions."

If the former professor
and president of the Uni-
versity of Arkansas is to
carry the case against the
administration in the com-
ing campaign, the Demo-
crats will leave the voters
cold. And since Sen. Ken-
nedy joined in approving
the nonsensical Fulbright
report, he too will be a
poor counsel for the prose-
cution.
And so the professor-
turned-senator conjured
up the curious theory that
while we must spy, the
President should take no
responsibility for the busi-
ness.

Apparently he would
have had the President say
that he had never heard of
the U-2 flights, was not
aware that any effort was
being made to spot Soviet
installations and that the
revelation by the Soviet
of the incident, was news
to him. Or perhaps he
would have had the Presi-
dent say nothing.
But in his subsequent
speech, he added further
mud to the muddy water
his report had created. He
said that he was not
against the President
telling the truth but that
the President should not
have become involved in
the incident.
That is indeed a curious
course of argument even
for a legal metaphysician.
