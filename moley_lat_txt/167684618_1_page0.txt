While the doctrines of
Henry George and other
tax reformers seem to
have faded into the past
and are largely forgotten
in the calculations and
teachings of economics,
the new policies of urban
renewal bring those ideas
into sharp focus again.
Henry George lived in a
predominantly rural civili-
zation, but his ideas have
a permanent value, and
their reconsideration was
never more necessary
than today.
Embodied in that phi-
losophy was the concept
that since land on 5th
Ave. is physically no bet-
ter than land 50 miles
away in the wooded Hud-
son valley, its greater
sales worth must be due
to the fact that many peo-
ple are living in the city.
Therefore, there attach-
es to prices a "social"
value created by the com-
munity. And that value
should be taxed to help
support the public needs of
the city.
Those who hold city
real estate with little in-
terest in its improvement
are thus speculators who
contribute little to the in-
terests of the community.
And if, as is necessary,
there is to be urban re-
newal or redevelopment,
the unearned increase in
values should be squeezed
from speculative profits.
Thus it would be less nec-
essary to tax not only
those who have built im-
provements but the gen-
erality of taxpayers.
In a study just complet-
ed in New York City by
a special committee on
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
tax policies organized by
the Citizens' Housing and
Planning Council, some
very interesting facts are
developed.
The committee started
with the self-evident fact
that New York, just like
all modern American cit-
ies, needs more and bet-
ter housing for its people
and that such housing
should supplant slum
properties. There should
be action to create that
housing.
But the committee
found that since the as-
sessments and, hence, the
tax burden on unim-
proved slum property are
far lower than on im-
proved property, the spec-
ulative values of such un-
improved property have
risen.
It is a curious fact,
then, that those who
make improvements are
punished. Government
thus puts pressure on
landowners not to do what
the government wants
done.
But to provide better
housing and to improve
the face of the city, state
and federal governments
break through the situa-
tion by pouring out vast
sums of money, largely
federal, to induce or to cre-
ate improvements. So the
government buys the land
and sells it to a developer.
The committee study
found that the govern-
ment paid $103,475,000 for
12 projects but then sold
the property to the devel-
oper for $22,721,303. The
government pays 70%
above the values at which
the same government has
assessed the property.
This low assessment on
unimproved land means
that to support the city,
more must be raised on
improved property. There
is neither common sense
nor justice in this.
For example, there are
two pieces of real estate
with a frontage of a block
each on 5th Ave. They face
each other and are of equal
attractiveness. When, un-
til recently, both had
buildings dating back to
the 19th century, the land
under them was appraised
at $5 million each. But a
private builder bought up
one and built a tremen-
dous office building. Noth-
ing happened to the other.
In the present appraisal,
the man who built the of-
fice building has had his
land assessed at $15 mil-
lion, while the other side
still pays on $5 million.
Thus the man who built
the big office building is
penalized for doing some-
thing to improve the city,
while the do-nothing own-
er pays the same as before.
A major remedy recom-
mended by the committee
is an overhauling of as-
sessment policies. Also, to
induce owners of undevel-
oped property to make im-
provements, it is suggested
that such improvements
be exempt from taxation
for a specified number of
years.
A rational move of this
kind would certainly light-
en the immense burden on
the federal budget as well
as promote the rebuilding
of our cities.
