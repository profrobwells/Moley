Our City Planners Might Learn
a Lesson From Baron Haussmann

BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The incredible energy
of Robert Moses, New
-York's city planner and
builder extraordinary, has
suggested a likeness to
Baron Georges Eugene
Haussmann, who was the
driving power employed
by Louis Napoleon in re-
constructing Paris exactly
a century ago.
Perhaps our present
city rebuilders, including
some senators who favor
huge federal outlays,
might learn from the les-
sons of that earlier proj-
ect. A frenetic effort to
accomplish too much too
soon ended in weird fi-
nancing, corruption, infla-
tion, and the downfall of
Haussmann shortly before
the might of Prussia end-
ed the empire of Napoleon
III.
Rome was not built in a
day. Nor is a modern city,
although it is obvious
that there should be a
steady, constructive and
properly financed rebuild-
ing at all times according
to a long-range plan.
Napoleon was greatly
interested in architecture
and planning long before
he came to power in
France after the 1848 rev-
olution: When he attained
power, first as president
and then as emperor, he
had made a master plan
for the rebuilding of the
city-a plan which was
the basis for Haussmann's
operations.
Great arterial ave-
nues were to be construct-
ed, ripping through dense,
unsightly and insanitary
slums. New water supplies
were to be brought to the
city, and great sewers
were included in the plan.
Napoleon's motives,
aside from his genuine
love of beauty, were high-
ly practical. First, he was
determined to end the de-
pression, which had been a
major cause of the 1848
revolution, by creating
abundant employ-
ment. Second, he was de-
termined to check disease
and crime which flour-
ished in the slums of Par-
is.

In the political area, he
wanted to make himself
popular with the masses.
Also, he wanted wide ave-
nues with troops' barracks
conveniently located so
that if an uprising came
he could maneuver his
forces to suppress disor-
der.
Haussmann had served
with great ability in sev-
eral of the lesser prefec-
tures of France when Na-
poleon made him prefect
of the Seine, the city's
major administrative offi-
cer. He was a man power-
ful in body and mind, with
a remarkable capacity for
audacity as well as craft.
He would have fulfilled
Machiavelli's prescription'
for a successful ruler:
something of a lion and
something of a fox.
Up to 1858, the financing
of the reconstruction was
quite orthodox and was
approved by the big bank-
ing houses of France, in-
cluding the Rothschilds.
But with inflation and
constant additions to the
plans, funds were scarce
in the 1860s. A device was
then created which was
ultimately disastrous to
Haussmann.
The Credit Foncier was
the mortgage bank of the
government. It had been
created in 1852 by decree.
Its business was mostly
with the various com-
munes.
As money for the
Haussmann projects began
to be scarce, so far as
grants from the national
and city governments were
concerned, the Credit
Foncier began to advance
money to contractors, ac-
cepting their bonds (notes)
as security.
At first a contractor
could get money only
when his job was com-
pleted. Then he was able
to secure financing when
his construction was part-
ly completed. Finally, he
secured payment in ad-
vance, before he had done
anything, merely by dis-
counting his own bonds
with the Credit Foncier,
*
This brought about a
storm of criticism in the
press, and ultimately Na-
poleon was forced to dis-
miss his master builder.
That was in 1869. A year
later, the beginning of the
end of Napoleon himself
came with the war with
Prussia.
It is clear that, despite
his unorthodox financing,
Haussmann did not enrich
himself. And he left a mod-
el of city planning which
has influenced almost ev-
ery large city in the world.
The pity is that his urge
to create a new city in so
short a time should have
ended in his own downfall.
