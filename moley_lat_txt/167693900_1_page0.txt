Anticipated Drop in Gas Tax Take
Threatens U.S. Highway Program
This is the time of year
that a warmth covers the
land. Trees are out.
Crops are pushing up.
Youngsters are squirming
in classrooms, awaiting
vacation. And across the
nation millions of Ameri-
cans are about to take to
their automobiles. This is
the time of year for
happy anticipation.
But the anticipation of
responsible
men con-
cerned with roadbuilding
is far from happy. With
the enormous $40 billion
interstate program well
under way, our mobile
population is indulging in
a venerable practice of
the human animal-silent
protest against the taxes
designed to pay for the
fancy new network.

An editorial in the Wall
Street Journal has under-
lined part of a vast, un-
comfortable dilemma. It
points out that leaders of
the National Highway
Users Conference have an-
nounced that the tax take
from gasoline is expected
to drop sharply and that
this is due to the rising
sales of smaller cars. Al-
though more cars will be
on the road in the next
few years, a rising per-
centage will be of the
smaller, more economical
types.
Add to this a degree of
consumer resistance by
cutting down driving dis-
tances and, in the case of
many two-car families, by
keeping the big gas eater
in the garage and depend-
ing more and more on the
wife's runabout.

Conference. spokesmen
speculate that, if the trend
goes on, by 1964 gasoline
tax revenues would fall
$548 million below esti-
mates.
There is also the unsur-
prising news that the fed-
eral government is not
getting the taxpayers'
money's worth in highway
construction. "Chiseling
and cheating" appear to
be widespread. With states
putting up 10% of costs to
the federal government's
90%, state officials have
not been as vigilant as
they might be if states
were financing a greater
percentage and citizens
were always at their el-
bow checking their plans,
projects and figures.
That the federal bureau-
crats are incapable of any-
thing approaching reason-
able surveillance goes
without saying. A plan is
in the works for "surprise"
checks to determine what
is going on. Are materials
up to standards, or will
roads crack up after a cou-
ple of hard winters or un-
der the weight of reason-
able traffic? Are fiscal
practices and books in
order? Is work being per-
formed efficiently?

The interstate program
is an example of the
economic utopian's ideal.
With abundance, there
should be less private
spending and more public
works and services. One
member of the National
Democratic Advisory
Council, Prof. John K.
Galbraith, has apparently
given Democrats in Con-
gress something with
which to salve their con-
sciences, and they meet
promises with big federal
spending bills without a
twinge. Galbraith main-
tains that our "affluent
society" should have fewer
of the things the people
want. Drain off purchasing
power by sales taxes and
provide for less work by
shorter hours and a more
leisurely pace when work-
ing.

But the obvious re-
sult of further adopting
such a policy would be
gradually to pare down
the amount and choice of
consumer goods and the
tax take. This would call
for more inflation.
Liberals might ponder
another set of facts. We
are not alone in this world.
We are not in a position
to withdraw to a sort of
permanent retreat from
the exciting and challeng-
ing realities of competi-
tion. Abroad are a number
of resourceful, capable and
hard-working adversaries
in foreign trade. At stake
are world markets, includ-
ing our own.
We still have a choice:
to isolate ourselves effec-
tively and recline in the
hammock of a planned
economy or to participate
and compete in the world
and at home, exercising
the best qualities of men-
enterprise, hard work,
creation, and freedom.
