RAYMOND MOLEY:
Kennedy Belittles
a Great American
As might be expected,
the professorial speech
writers employed by candi-
date Kennedy are rich in
historical allusions. They
are, as is unfortunately
true of some of their pro-
fession, quite ready with
wise cracks and phrase
turning.
The Kennedy accept-
ance speech is an omen of
things to come. Seemingly,
the pundits ransacked the
books for unfortunate peo-
ple bearing the name of
Richard.
The speech reminded its
hearers that Richard I
was the successor to the
very forceful Henry II.
But Kennedy might have
added that if President
Truman's advice had been
taken and he had waited
a few years and Nixon had
failed, he might have suc-
ceeded this Richard. His-
tory tells us that the suc-
cessor to Richard I was
the weak and perfidious
John who was compelled
to sign the Magna Charta.
Even Richard Cromwell
was resurrected—a man
remembered only by those
high school students who
are fresh from their les-
sons. He succeeded Oliver
Cromwell for a brief mo-
ment.
As the campaign gets
hotter and more personal,
we may expect the Ken-
nedy pundits to resurrect
for comparisons with Rich-
ard Nixon two other his-
torical figures. The un-
fortunate Richard II, and
the reputed monster, Rich-
ard III. So far as the latter
is concerned, recent his-
torical evidence reveals
that Richard III was not a
bad man or a bad king.
But in hitting at Nixon
by a sneer at Benjamin
Franklin, politics gave
way to a gross injustice to
the greatest, most distin-
guished, and most gifted
American of his time. Ken-
nedy said that Nixon's
"speeches are generalities
from 'Poor Richard's Al-
manac.'"
It happens that under
the name "Poor Richard,"
Franklin as a famous, self-
made refugee from his na-
tive Boston at the early
age of 26 began his series
of almanacs in 1732, the
year Washington was born.
It added greatly to his
reputation and his fortune.
His advice was homey,
sound and useful. The
wisdom and the aphorisms
became household words
for more than two centuries.
It would be interesting to
have candidate Kennedy
explain wherein he differs
from Poor Richard's advice.
It went into such subjects
as thrift, paying one's
debts and patriotism.
But it was wisdom not
just from a country bump-
kin. For the almanac was
written by a man who,
still younger than candi-
date Kennedy, indicated
that he had read widely in
the riches of world litera-
ture—Dryden, Pope, Prior,
Swift, Bacon, La Rochefou-
cauld. There are sayings
in the almanac from the
Latin, Spanish, French,
German and Welsh.
With the money Frank-
lin gained from his writ-
ings, he bought time for
profoundly important re-
search and contributions
in electricity which gave
him respect in the scien-
tific circles of Europe.
There was also time and
money for a vast public
service. He spent nearly
30 years abroad in the
service of his country and
not only made the success
of the American revolu-
tion certain by his nego-
tiations with the French,
but won respect for his
country everywhere.
The implication in all
the Kennedy speeches that
no one who was born be-
fore 1916 can project a
vision of the future is de-
nied by the later life of
Franklin. His vision of the
future gave something to
Americans that no other
leader could equal—in
science, diplomacy, states-
manship, in the preserva-
tion of liberty, and social
progress.
When at the age of Ken-
nedy's father, Franklin re-
turned from unavailing ef-
forts to conciliate the Brit-
ish with America, he
helped draft the Declara-
tion of Independence, a
constitution for Pennsyl-
vania, and the articles of
confederation. Then the el-
derly man was again sent
abroad, where he conclud-
ed a treaty of alliance with
France and in 1783 dom-
inated the peace-making
with England.
In the movement for a
new constitution, he was a
great force and as a dele-
gate to the convention in
1787 this venerable man
of 81 contributed more
than any other member to
the reconciliation of sharp
differences and the wis-
dom in fundamentals
which made a new nation
a success. While Franklin
was not a major contribu-
tor to the language of the
constitution, it can be as-
serted that without him
the convention could not
have succeeded.
It was not only bad taste
but bad politics flippantly
to demean Franklin in or-
der to thrust at an oppo-
nent. I once heard a stu-
dent tell an English profes-
sor that he just didn't like
Shakespeare. The reply
was, "Young man, you do
not judge Shakespeare;
Shakespeare judges you."
