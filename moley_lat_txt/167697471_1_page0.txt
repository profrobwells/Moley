RAYMOND MOLEY:
Kennedy Now Must
Turn to Vital Issues
In the long struggle for
the nomination, Sen. Ken-
nedy's age and religion
looked up as two of his
most serious problems.
Like any good politician
when faced with apparent
liabilities, he sought to
turn them into assets.
★
Now that he is nominat-
ed he may—and those who
want a campaign on is-
sues rather than on per-
sonalities may hope he
will—turn to more rele-
vant matters. For the is-
sues which will distin-
guish the candidates one
from the other are of crit-
ical concern to the future
of this country and the
world.
Kennedy and his innu-
merable assistants and
supporters did so well and
were so earnest in meeting
those alleged deficiencies
that they actually overdid
it. It was made to appear
that youth in itself is an
indispensable quality in a
President, and that anyone
who opposed Kennedy was
actuated by religious
bigotry.
Now, since he and Vice
President Nixon were both
born in the second decade
of the 20th century, it
will not be easy to make
age an issue. And unless
fanatics make bigoted
statements embarrassing
the probable Republican
candidate, there will be no
need to discuss religion.
Nixon's record certainly
indicates that he would
repudiate any religious ap-
peal if his behalf.
★
Youth in itself is no vir-
tue. Its values, as George
Bernard Shaw once sug-
gested, are wasted on the
young. Nor is gray hair,
unless the brain under-
neath has acquired wis-
dom through experience.
But Kennedy has repeat-
edly made the point that
only a President born
lately can envision what
is coming in the 1960s.
He made the point that
most of the world leaders
today are men whose edu-
cation was completed be-
fore the "good years"
ended in 1914. This is not
only a narrow view of edu-
cation, but a lack of ap-
preciation of what might
be learned from the years
before World War I.
It was a mere gesture
for Kennedy to parade an
academic knowledge of the
fact that from Theodore
Roosevelt back through
Napoleon and the younger
Pitt to Alexander there
were brilliant young men
at the head of nations' af-
fairs.
In high-school debating,
an opponent could cite an
equal number of older men
who did quite well after
middle life. Whatever
Alexander knew, he
learned from that wise
philosopher who tutored
him, Aristotle, and the
younger Pitt came to
eminence because he had
a brilliant and mature fa-
ther, the Earl of Chatham.
★
It is not that these men
were young. It was what
they knew and understood
that counted.
It is no compliment to
Catholics to infer that they
will vote for a man solely
because of his religion. In-
deed, it is an affront to
their capacity to make
judgments on issues which
go to the heart of what the
candidates are proposing
to support as national pol-
icy.
I have been chastised in
letters from clergymen for
saying that a man's reli-
gion is irrelevant when a
selection is being made for
a public trust. Religion, I
still maintain, is not rel-
evant if we are to believe,
as our constitutional
principles state, that in
the United States there is
a division between church
and state. And also that
religion should not be a
test for public office.
★
Catholics, like all Amer-
icans, will judge the can-
didates on the basis of
their will and capacity to
maintain and further the
traditions of political and
economic liberty and
strength in the free world
to oppose the Communist
threat.
And so, after the Repub-
licans are finished with
their convention, let us all
get down to the serious
business of making a
choice which may well be
the most momentous in
more years than both
candidates have lived.
