Party Loyalty Falters in the Face
of the Serious Election Issues
In many respects this
Presidential campaign dif-
fers from all others. In
the first place, there will
be more ticket-splitting
than ever before. There
are a number of states in
which the party—either
party—will win for the
state ticket and lose the
national ticket.
Voters are not moved by
appeals to party. Things
seem too serious to expect
people to rush to the aid
of their party. Anyhow,
millions have no apparent
party preference at all.
The cold statistical facts
are that the Republican
Party stood still in 1940,
1944, and 1948, so far as
the popular vote for President was concerned. The
Democratic Party cast a
million fewer votes in 1956
than it did in 1952, despite
the fact that there were
around a million more eligible voters in the latter
year than in the former.
Its vote in the years between fluctuated from 27
million down to 25 million.

In the South, as all observers have noted, there
is basic loyalty to something called the Democratic Party because of the
past, but state leaders,
governors and senators are
largely the product of personal factions within the
party. There is no real party organization there except in two or three states.
Party registration means very little, as has
been shown over and over
in California. How a man
registers is something that
is a public record, but how
he votes is his own secret.
Hence, there may be reasons why he wants it
known that he registered
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
in one party or the other
wholly aside from his real
convictions.
In this campaign in particular the issue is embodied in what the two
people on each ticket—
Kennedy—Johnson and
Nixon—Lodge—are and
what they say.
That is especially true
of Nixon and Kennedy.
They are something new—
in their youth, personal
attractiveness and zeal in
campaigning as two candidates have never campaigned before.

Millions are sizing up
these two men, seeking
to appraise how they
would behave in the
White House, how well
they would guard the
peace, and how they
would deal with inflation. How strong are they?
How well are they trained
for the job? Who are they
likely to have around
them if elected?
All this means that
millions must go on their
own in making a decision. And what is more
important, if they as individuals feel strongly
about one candidate or
the other, they must devise, on their own, methods of influencing others
to feel likewise. In short,
politics becomes a do-it-yourself operation.
The two candidates realize this, and that is
why we are hearing and
seeing a lot more about
“Citizens for Kennedy”
and “Citizens for Nixon”
than about the two parties. Each party has its
national headquarters running as usual, pouring out
literature and other material. But each candidate
has his personal organization.
The Nixon-Lodge headquarters in Washington
has what it calls Operation
SNAP—meaning Support
Nixon at the Polls. Kits
are available for individual
workers who wish to influence their friends and
neighbors. Similar material can be gotten from the
Kennedy-Johnson headquarters.
There is also an excellent nonpartisan folder
called, “How You Can Win
in Politics,” available from
the office of the National
Associated Businessmen,
Inc., 1725 K St., NW,
Washington 6, D.C. In
brief form, this has everything that an individual
who wishes to exercise influence needs to be effective.

It is too late this year to
reform the two parties.
But individuals can do a
lot. Anyone has influence
in his own circle of friends.
He or she can have a few
in for coffee in an evening
to talk things over and decide to do something about
getting others to register
and vote.
There will be time later
to help reform the parties
and get them to be more
active and efficient. But
this is a very decisive election for every American.
And he can do a lot with
his own circle of friends
and neighbors in his own
community. Let this be a
people’s election, with
American individualism
once more in evidence.
