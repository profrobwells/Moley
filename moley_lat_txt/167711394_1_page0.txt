RAYMOND MOLEY:
English-U.S. Campaign Parallels
As I have followed with
close attention the course
of this Presidential cam-
paign, I have become more
and more impressed by its
similarity to the general
election campaign in Eng-
land in September and Oc-
tober, 1950.
I was over there for the
three weeks before the
election, gathering infor-
mation and impressions,
visiting industrial commu-
nities like Birmingham,
Coventry and London.
Here is how it was:
Things began moving
with the issuance of the
Labor Party manifesto,
which appeared on Sept.
18, about 20 days before
the election. It painted a
lurid picture of the con-
trast between the business
community and the plight
of the old, the sick, and
the unemployed.
*
It attacked the compla-
cency of the Conservative
government. It said that
the Conservative govern-
ment was "self-deceived,"
at home and abroad. It at-
tacked the shortcomings
of the Conservatives, espe-
cially at Suez and Cyprus,
and said that the prestige
of Britain was declining
abroad.
It promised more hous-
ing, more hospitals, more
aid for "depressed areas."
Especially, it promised to
raise pensions 10 shillings
a week. This was the wide-
ly placarded "10 bob" is-
sue, designed to get the
votes of old people.
To pay for all the bene-
fits, Hugh Gaitskell fell
back on two devices which
we have heard about over
here in this campaign in
almost every major
speech: a higher rate of
economic growth and clos-
ing the loopholes in tax
laws.
★
The theory of economic
growth through govern-
ment spending proposed
by Gaitskell and Kennedy
comes from the same school
of economic philosophy.
So far as loopholes in tax
laws were concerned, La-
bor spokesmen promised
to stop tax-dodging and to
look intb "business ex-
pense accounts."
Over here this year the
Democratic platform says,
"We shall close the loop-
holes in the tax laws . . .
Among the most conspicu-
ous loopholes are depletion
allowances which are in-
equitable, special consider-
ation for recipients of di-
vided income, and deduc-
tions for 'extravagant busi-
ness expenses' . . . We
shall bring in additional
revenues by expanding the
economy itself."
★
Finally, in his last ap-
peals, Gaitskell promised
to cut taxes.
The relative advantage
of the two sides in Britain
as interpreted in the press
and elsewhere followed
the same line that we have
seen here. There was great
confidence in a Conserva-
tive victory four weeks be-
fore election. Then the
tide seemed to swing to
Labor.
Macmillan started at a
slow pace which greatly
irritated many of his
supporters. Then Labor
seemed to be gaining. It
had better television pres-
entations. Gaitskell was
more vigorous. The polls
in four big daily newspa-
pers, most of which were
supplied by the Gallup
organization, showed the
same pattern.
★
Then the gap narrowed,
until on Oct. 5, three days
before the election, the
gap closed. The Conserva-
tives had grown more and
more scared as the cam-
paign proceeded, and they
hit harder.
But the polls also indi-
cated a large uncommit-
ted vote, just as they do
here now.
Finally, at the end of
the campaign, Macmillan
made a magnificent speech
stressing the pride and
strength of the British
people. It made a profound
impression. But as the
event showed, it would
not even have been neces-
sary. For most of the un-
committed were going to
vote Conservative all the
time. They simply did not
want their friends among
the industrial workers to
know they were changing
from Labor to Conserva-
tive.
★
They voted Conserva-
tive because they knew,
as Gaitskell said after the
election, that they were
better off under the Mac-
millan government. They
had moved in great num-
bers into better homes
and into better sections of
the industrial cities.
The election, as every-
one knows, was a great
landslide for the stout and
experienced leadership of
Macmillan.
★
Therefore, it would be
foolish for anyone here to
draw conclusions from the
course of the 1960 cam-
paign so far. It has been
following the same pat-
tern, with the same issues,
and the ominous number
of the uncommitted as in
1959 in Britain. The rest
of the campaign may well
be the same here as over
there.
