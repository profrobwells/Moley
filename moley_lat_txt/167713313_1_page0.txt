Civil Rights Planks Invade Areas
of Personal Privilege, Local Law

It has often been said,
with great truth, that the
toughest public problems
are not decisions between
right arid wrong but be-
tween two conflicting
rights.

It was so when a right-
to-work law was placed
on the ballot in several
states two years ago. A
man should have a right
to keep his means of live-
lihood without joining and
contributing to a union.
But it was contended that
an employer has a right
to make a closed shop con-
tract with a union.

In such cases it is the
responsibility of states-
manship to consider all
the practical facts in-
volved and to legislate in
some way that will save
the substance of right on
both sides and inflict the
least infringement upon
freedom of choice.

It is so with what are
called civil rights. Properly
considered, what are
now called civil rights have
moved far beyond either
moral or legal rights.

Politicians in public au-
thority have consistently
moved to make legal
rights under federal law
out of many matters
which formerly either
were regarded as private
privilege or have been
established within the ex-
clusive powers of the
states.

There is something
called the reign of law,
and also something
known as the consent of
the governed. These prin-
ciples, as old as Anglo-
Saxon civilization, mean
roughly that law, any
law, if it is to be respect-
ed and enforced, must ap-
peal to an overwhelming
majority of those who
live under it.

The temperance move-
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
ment was an effort to
strengthen individual and
social sanctions. Temper-
ance said, "Don't touch
the stuff." Prohibition
said, "You can't have it."
The latter failed except
in places where an over-
whelming majority of the
people agreed.

It will be so with civil
rights. Legislation already
passed and in Supreme
Court decisions, and, above
all, in the party platforms,
proposes to push federal
authority on and into
the area formerly occu-
pied by public opinion
and state and local law.

Reasonable individuals
must realize that the
point at which federal
power can effectively op-
erate has already been
passed and that further
response to those who
want more "rights" creat-
ed by law not only will
be ineffective but will
greatly worsen the situa-
tion of Negroes.

For when the people
who hold governmental
authority in the Southern
States are disregarded
the response of the peo-
ple who have elected
those governments will
be a denial of privileges
and benefits hitherto
granted the Negroes.

In fact, that is what
has already happened.
The relations between the
two races have already de-
teriorated. The greatest
loss is suffered by the
Negroes.

A comparison of the
two platforms of the par-
ties this year makes it
clear that the Democratic
platform is far more dras-
tic than that of the Re-
publicans. It also goes be-
yond anything seen since
the radical Republicans
were riding high and
cruelly in the days of the
Reconstruction.

This is especially true
of the provisions which
concern eligibility to vote
and the recent sitdown
agitation. The Democrats
would abolish all literacy
tests for voting, presuma-
bly in the North as well
as the South. The Re-
publicans say that the
completion of the sixth
grade should be accepted
as a literary qualification.
That is fair.

The Democrats mention
sitdowns by name. The
Republicans commend
those who have eliminat-
ed discrimination in re-
tail establishments and
urge others to follow the
example.

But in urging more
legislation, both were
guided by political ex-
pediency. The Democrats
said, in effect, to the
South: "We don't need
you any more." The Re-
publicans said: "We need
New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Illinois more
than we need you."

Cynicism breeds cyni-
cism. When, to gain a po-
litical advantage, political
leaders go beyond what
they must reasonably be-
lieve to be wise and just,
it follows that citizens
everywhere will be either
cynical or indifferent
toward all politics and
politicians.

For there are two kinds
of rights arrayed here:
The rights of the South
to deal with its problem
by gradual means, and, on
the other side, the rights
demanded by many Ne-
groes.

Perhaps neither party
means all that it says in
its platform. That would
be super-cynicism.
