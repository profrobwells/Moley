Sen. Goldwater Has Contributed
an Indispensable Service to GOP
The Republican Party
emerged from its Chicago
convention in much better
shape, with a firmer belief
in victory in November,
with a finer fighting spirit,
and greater unity than it
has had in 32 years.
Several individuals
should be singled out as
having contributed to that
achievement. There was
the appeal to the moral
code by Herbert Hoover,
the party's venerable dean
-a factor in summoning
the emotional instincts of
voters, likely to be forgot-
ten in the mad matching of
materialistic promises so
common in recent years.
President Eisenhower
rose to heights in giving
the party an account of his
record on which the party
may base its appeal for a
vote of confidence.
The adroitness of candi-
date Nixon has been famil-
iar to those who have
known him best. But he
underlined that quality in
this instance for all to see.

Charles Percy labored
indefatigably in shaping
the platform, and while
the document is too long
and will not be noticed
from here on, it was one
which created unity while
it kept to certain funda-
mentals.
Gov. Rockefeller rose far
above the apparent petu-
lance which he revealed
only a month ago.
But the service of Sen.
Barry Goldwater was
unique and supplied some-
thing which will be in-
dispensable to Republican
success. In four elections
-in 1936, 1940, 1944 and
1948 the plain statistics
show that Republican vic-
tory was foredoomed by
the apathy of millions who
might have been sum-

moned by a more forth-
right expression of opin-
ion by the candidates and
the platforms.
Even in 1952, on the eve
of a great victory, the con-
vention in Chicago left
raw wounds which only
the Taft-Eisenhower meet-
ing in mid-September suc-
ceeded in healing. This
time, the way has been
cleared for a big vote by
the participation of Gold-
water in the convention.
He first demonstrated to
the convention and to the
country that there is a
very large and vital ele-
ment in the Republican
Party which believes in
progress, but through
those principles which
have attended progress in
the past.

This was the meaning of
his temporary candidacy
and the demonstrations
which attended it. Then
there was his withdrawal
and his pledge to support
Nixon. Finally, and most
important, there was an
appeal to his friends:
"We must remember
that Republicans have not
been losing elections be-
cause of more Democratic
votes now get this
we have been losing elec-
tions because conserva-
tives too often fail to vote.
"Why is this? And you
conservatives think this
over-we don't gain any-
thing when you get mad
at a candidate because you
don't agree with his philos-
ophy. Forget it!
"This country is too im-
portant for anyone's feel-
ings. This country in its
majesty is too great for
any man, be he conserva-
tive or liberal, to stay
home and not work just
because he doesn't agree
. Let's get to work."
Those words should be
fully comprehended by ev-
ery irreconcilable.
In my travels over the
country I have heard from
many conservatives such
comments as this: "If Nix-
on doesn't stop associating
with Mitchell, Flemming
and Rogers, I am done
with him," and "Nixon is
appeasing the liberals.
There is nothing left for
me to support," and "I'm
mad because Eisenhower
hasn't done this or that.
Therefore I don't like Nix-
on."
This sort of thing repre-
sents an all-or-nothing at-
titude. But if we are to
have two political parties,
both must have elements
at variance with one an-
other. The only way to
satisfy everyone is to have
as many parties as France
had before De Gaulle. And
a multi-party system leads
to a one-party system, and
a one-party system leads
to a one-man system.

The firm defense of our
individual liberty is in a
two-party system. This has
been proved by all his-
tory. Conservatives, by in-
sisting that their candidate
agree with them complete-
ly, are merely contribut-
ing to the end which all
conservatives should dread
the most centralized
government, and, ulti-
mately, dictatorship and
tyranny.
This is what Goldwater
will preach from now to
the end of his public serv-
ice. His mission is one of
major proportions. And he
has left no doubt about his
willingness and ability to
perform that service.
Sometimes it is better to
be right than President.
Here is an example.
