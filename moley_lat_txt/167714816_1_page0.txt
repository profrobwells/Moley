RAYMOND MOLEY:
Demos Avoid Scandal
by a Major Miracle
July opens with the battle for the Democratic
Presidential nomination
reduced to two contenders,
each with ample resources
and a desperate will to
win.
If the gentle Adlai Stevenson gets it, the prize
will roll his way after
Johnson and Kennedy
have exterminated each
other.
Sometimes they also win
who only stand and wait.
But even if that happens,
the nomination will be
stained by the tearing and
clawing of the major contenders now.
It is nothing less than a
miracle that no major
scandal has yet developed.
The evidence is all there
that money has been spent
by the Kennedy family
and friends with an abandon seldom before seen in
a political contest in this
country.
And the Johnson-Ray-
burn forces have used
promises and threats common to politics as far back
as the days of the Wal-
poles over two centuries
ago.
It may well be that the
good luck that has attended
these contestants so far
will fail to hold out. A
slip in the expenditure of
money or the anger and
pride of someone who resents crude threats will
flare up in a sensational
revelation.
That has happened before, notably in the pre-
convention fight by Gov.
Lowden in 1920. No delegate wants to be tied up to
a tainted nomination.
Massive financial resources are behind Kennedy
and there run in the
tradition of the family the
techniques of Boston ward
leaders. Nothing has been
obtainable literary and
professorial pundits to put
out the ideological line,
and heavy-handed professional operators in the
towns and precincts.
On the one side there
are fine highbrow effusions by the candidate,
and in the hinterlands,
such as the hills of West
Virginia, stark realities
rear their heads.
No doubt there were
also high-priced legal
lights to see that everything was perfectly within
the statutes. And the statement on "unimpeachable"
authority of suggestions of
favors to come after the
election has already been
made. That sort of thing in
past contests has won
many a nomination.
Abraham Lincoln knew
nothing of what went on a
century ago in Chicago but
switches in Pennsylvania
and Ohio votes which
cinched the nomination
were followed by cabinet
appointments to leaders in
the two states.
With the Johnson-Ray-
burn combination there
are threats and favors
which can be used with
much closer impact than a
speculative promise redeemable after a possible
election. They actually
control legislation close to
the hearts of hundreds of
local politicians.
And in the Senate, and
possibly in the House, both
men will be in control after
the new year begins.
The power to give or withhold in housing, rivers and
harbors and public building is very great and it can
be pinpointed for the benefit of wavering state and
local delegates.
Kennedy has no such
authority. He can only
promise vast scattering of
benefits over large classes
of citizenry.
Both, however, involve
using the credit of the
United States for political
ends. But what is national
solvency compared with
dredging a muddy river or
building a new post office
or authorizing a power
dam? Or with scattering
"plenty o'er a smiling
land" of old men and women, teachers and school
boards and mayors.
The calling of a rump or
"Turnip Day" convocation
of the national legislature
is a great advantage to the
Johnson-Rayburn combine. Expenditures involving
billions of taxpayers'
money will stand in the
balance.
In reality, Johnson-Ray-
burn can go to Los Angeles
with blank checks on
the Treasury in their
hands. A personal fortune
or even a plentitude of
delegate strength must
contend with private or
sectional favor. This is
what is at stake in the
next few days.
And in the infighting in
a convention the accomplished parliamentarians
from Texas have no peers.
