RAYMOND MOLEY:
Decision a Setback
to Free Enterprise
One of the most disturbing
decisions of our divided
Supreme Court in recent
years was one handed
down last month. It
could have pervasive and
deleterious effects upon
our system of enterprise.
The case had to do with
a railroad's and a union's
rights and responsibilities
in what would appear to
be the function of increasing
the efficiency and solvency
of the road in the public
interest. In 1956 the
Chicago & North Western
Railway encountered severe
financial troubles. The road
had not been maintained
properly. Inefficient and
wasteful practices had not
been eliminated. A new
management, seeking to
improve the road's position,
included in its streamlining
program a plan to discontinue
many "one-man" stations
and to establish a central
agency plan whereby an
agent could perform the
necessary services of several
stations.

North Western turned to
the proper authority—the
public utility commissions
of states in which it
served. This procedure
is in accord with the
Interstate Commerce Act
and was reaffirmed by the
Transportation Act of 1958
in which Congress clearly
told the railroads to go to
the states (not to the unions)
before abandoning or
consolidating local stations.
In 1958 the South Dakota
commission, after finding
that the work load of agents
at 69 stations averaged less
than an hour a day, directed
North Western to make its
plan effective immediately.
However, the railway
union involved—the Order
of Railroad Telegraphers—
served notice on the
management that it must
bargain on a provision that
no jobs could be abolished
except by agreement. The
alternative: a strike. The
railroad proposed to negotiate
with the union as to
severance pay and other
matters concerning those
agents who would be displaced.
The union refused, reiterating
that if North Western
refused to "comply" with
the union's demand it would
suffer a strike.
North Western brought
suit, and eventually the
court of appeals found that
acceptance of the union
demand could not legally
be forced by a strike. Last
month, the U.S. Supreme
Court reversed this decision.
Four justices dissented
strongly, bringing out
overwhelming evidence of
Congressional intent which
supports the railroad's
position and previous court
decisions supporting the
ruling of the court of appeals.
Justice Whittaker's dissent
points out that "for all
practical purposes the court
is telling the railroad that
it must secure the union's
approval before severing the
hundreds of surplus employees
now carried on its payroll.
Everyone knows what the
answer of the union will be."
Whittaker notes further
that the court "gives to the
union a veto power over" a
legal action of the states,
and goes on to say, "Certainly
that demand runs in the
teeth of the recited provisions
and policies of the Interstate
Commerce Act. It plainly
would destroy the public
regulation of abandonments,
provided and contemplated
by Congress in the public
interest, and render them
subject to the unions' will
alone. A demand for such
contractual power surely is an
unlawful demand."
*
A little imagination opens
up a fantastic economic
prospect if such power is
delivered into the hands of
our union hierarchy. American
enterprise everywhere grapples
with energetic competition.
Greater production, automation,
and a very high degree of
efficiency are indispensable
to future prosperity. To hamper,
to check, to frustrate these
developments can work only
to the detriment of a vast
majority, including most
union men. Although Congress
may have every reason to
feel that it had made itself
unmistakably clear on the
points at issue in the Telegraphers
vs. Chicago & North Western
case, it may have to spend
valuable time to spell out
again its intent, for the benefit
of five men on the Supreme
Court.
