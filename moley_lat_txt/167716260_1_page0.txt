Farm-to-Town Shift
of Voters Helps GOP
A month ago I wrote a
column describing my im-
pressions after an automo-
bile trip through Iowa and
Nebraska and on to the
West Coast.
It was noted there that
a close look at the towns
and the farms in that part
of the country brought out
the important political fact
that there are vital dif-
ferences in opinion be-
tween those who live and
work and do business in
the smaller cities and
towns of the wheat and
corn belt and those politi-
cians who are represent-
ing the farmers' plight as
the dominant issue in this
campaign.

Since that time, I have
traveled by automobile
3,000 more miles through
the coast states. In what
was revealed in the course
of those travels, as well as
in certain facts that have
become known in other
ways, my conclusion has
been abundantly con-
firmed.
The reliable Des Moines
Register has published a
poll taken in Iowa which
shows that over all in that
state the Nixon-Lodge
ticket had 51%, while the
Kennedy-Johnson ticket
had 41%. But a poll of the
Iowa farmers ran 48% for
Kennedy-Johnson and 45%
for Nixon-Lodge.
If this proves anything,
it is that the towns and
cities are not rejecting the
Republican ticket because
of Benson - Eisenhower
and also that among farm-
ers there is far from an
overwhelming opposition
to the Republican side.
Iowa is regarded by
most politicians and com-
mentators as perhaps the
most typical farm state.
But the inexorable shift
in the preponderance of
the voting population from
farm to town is strong
there, as it is elsewhere.

Among the letters I have
received since the column
mentioned above was pub-
lished is a very interesting
one from an editor in
North-Central Illinois, an
area also classed as part of
the "distressed agricul-
tural" region. He notes
that the new census will
show a startling increase
in the white-collar and
highly skilled population,
with the farm vote mov-
ing still more deeply into
a minority position.
He also says that the
members of the unions in
some of the industrial cen-
ters of Central Illinois are
getting restive about the
marriage of convenience
between their union lead-
ers and the farm politi-
cians.
They are beginning to
realise, he says, that they
are the most frequent tax
payers of all every pay
day and are beginning to
ask about "carrying the
farmers on their backs."
One of the most inter-
esting political tricks in
the history of farm ap-
peasement was F. D.
Roosevelt's original "do-
mestic allotment" plan.
The processing tax which
was supposed to pay for
that subsidy put the cost
squarely on the consumer.
Every industrial worker
paid that tax when he
bought a cotton garment or
a loaf of bread.
On the other hand, ev-
ery increase in wages re-
ceived by the industrial
worker throws "parity"
against the farmer's inter-
ests because he must pay
more for what he needs.
Thus, the government has
put in motion an unending
seesaw. More subsidies de-
mand more costly produc-
tion in industry, and so on.
Since the days between
Yorktown in 1781 and the
inauguration of the gov-
ernment in 1789, farmers
have been deluded by their
love of inflation. Great po-
litical changes have come
from that.
â˜…
The free silver craze
and greenbackism were
more recent examples.
Never do farmers seem to
realize that in inflation ev-
eryone loses but a few
speculators. The farmer
pays more for his farm im-
plements and clothing and
furniture. The worker is
led to believe that he pays
less for his food, but he
should realize that a part
of his taxes goes to sub-
sidize the farmer.
One of the most ardent
supporters of high and
rigid parity is Walter Reu-
ther of the UAW. He has
two motives beyond his in-
herent socialistic philoso-
phy. He wants to keep
the farmers out of the la-
bor market and on their
uneconomical farms. And
he wants cheaper food for
his union members.
But his members are
now realizing that they are
actually paying in their
taxes what they have been
led to believe they are sav-
ing at the supermarket.
When and if political lead-
ership this year brings this
fact home, there will be
trouble keeping those
workers in line with their
leaders' directives.
