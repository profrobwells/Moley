RAYMOND MOLEY:
Ways to Medical
Help for the Aged
There are so many sides
from which to approach
the problem of medical
care for elderly people and
so many reasons why the
almost identical plans in-
troduced by Sen. John
Kennedy and Rep. Aime
Forand are bad solutions
that it is possible only to
consider one at a time.
In an earlier column I
indicated why Americans
over 65 are not an essen-
tially poor and needy
group. True, there are
needy people among them,
but so are there in all oth-
er age groups.
*
The Kennedy - Forand
proposal fails to single out
those who really need help
and throws indiscriminate
benefits over a whole group
of arbitrarily designated
people — those who are
eligible for old age and
survivors benefits.
Next in order should be
a consideration of re-
sources and facilities al-
ready in existence to meet
the problem. And since
these resources and fa-
cilities have been growing
with incredible rapidity
over the past decade, it
would seem a shame to
halt this growth by a free-
for-all federal handout.
The existing facilities
are both governmental
and private.
Governments — federal,
state and local — are al-
ready heavily supporting
medical care. Their com-
bined outlays are $5.4 bil-
lion. The federal govern-
ment alone is providing
medical care for 30 million
people.
*
Fifty per cent of medi-
cal research in the United
States is supported by the
federal government. A
third of all the hospitals in
the United States are op-
erated by government.
Private provision for
health insurance is classed
under three types: the
Blue Cross and Blue Shield
plans; health insurance by
commercial companies;
and miscellaneous groups
offering various kinds of
coverage.
At the end of 1958 Blue
Cross had an enrollment
of 55 million; Blue Shield
had 46 million. Private in-
surance agencies had 72
million. Many more are
covered by the independ-
ent group-practice plans.
Usually these are associ-
tions of doctors. In 1957,
these plans had more than
8 million subscribers.
Forty-three per cent of
the elderly have either
Blue Cross or Blue Shield
or both.
It should be noted that
there still exists, despite
modernistic thinking, the
obligation of children to
their parents. After grant-
ing all the argument for
the desirability of com-
plete independence for
people of all ages, it still
makes good sense and con-
firms to the dictates of
common humanity that
children who can afford it
return a small part of what
they have received from
their parents.
*
After all, under the Ken-
nedy-Forand philosophy,
those children will be con-
tributing to the support of
their parents. Is it any
more humiliating to re-
ceive something from one’s
own children than to get
help from everybody’s
children through the tax
route?
Then there are the doc-
tors themselves, thousands
of whom are contributing
what they can to the help
of those who need it.
But the strongest argu-
ment against the shotgun
approach of the Kennedy-
Forand plan is not that
these other resources and
facilities are so important
now but that they are
growing at such a tre-
mendous rate. In the 10
years between 1948 and
1958 the number of people
covered by some form of
private health insurance
grew from 61 million to
123 million.
*
Obviously, if the govern-
ment, under the Kennedy-
Forand plan, should pro-
vide coverage free, the
growth of private means
of insurance will to a large
extent wither away. For
once the door to govern-
ment medical care is open,
there is no closing it. And
there is no way to prevent
indefinite, endless exten-
sions.
For the very pressure
on the resources of the
generality of taxpayers by
the costs of the plan and
its inflationary conse-
quences will create cover-
age from cradle to grave.
