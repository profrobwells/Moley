Cities Do Not Need
Federal Handouts
It seems that one of
these brief chronicles of
mine, written and pub-
lished in newspapers two
months ago, stirred up a
considerable hornets' nest
of letter writers.
The letters still come in
two in the morning's
mail. Some agree and some
do not. This is, of course,
the way it is with those of
us who write for print, and
it is what makes life in-
teresting.
In that article back in
July, I described an auto-
mobile trip of mine from
New York to Los Angeles.
I told of what I had seen
and felt concerning the
amazing results of the ex-
penditures of billions of
federal money on inter-
state highways.
There could be little ar-
gument about the excel-
lence of the new highways,
so far as they are complet-
ed, and hundreds of miles
are there for all to see.

But now the complaints
are that while we are
spending our millions of
what we have left after
taxes on new automobiles,
our city traffic is, in many
places, a congested mess.
The inference is that if
the federal government
would take more from us
through taxes, we could
buy fewer automobiles
and Uncle Sam could pro-
vide our cities with better
accommodations for traf-
fic. By inference and Sen.
Kennedy is saying.
In all those 3,000 miles
on my route very few
cities had to be encoun-
tered. With improvements
planned or under way,
no considerable urban
area needs to be crossed
by an interstate traveler.
The issue comes down
to the simple point that,
with some exceptions,
cities which are rich
enough and busy enough
to have traffic problems
have the resources to bear
a considerable part of the
burden of street improve-
ment.
While they are scream-
ing for federal aid, the
Holy Grail of relief is right
tured if the authorities and
the people who elect those
authorities have the
courage to make use of
it.
The major reason why
there is ugliness and con-
gestion, why cities and
suburbs are so spotty in
their development — with
slums and vacant land
alongside fine, improved
property—is land specula-
tions. Under the taxing
and assessment practices
which generally prevail,
the landowner who
chooses to let his proper-
ty remain undeveloped
and, in many cases, ridden
with slums is rewarded
with fat profits when he
sells, and a heavy penalty
is imposed upon the own-
er who builds improve-
ments.
Fortunes have been
made in New York City
in dilapidated property
along streets like 3rd Ave.,
where new buildings are
going up. Fortunes are be-
ing made along new high-
way systems, just as for-
tunes were made in the
1860s and 1870s on land
along the new railways.

When federal money
goes into what is called
"urban renewal," land val-
ues are enhanced, and the
major profits go to specula-
tors. In a recent article in
Newsweek about Joseph P.
Kennedy — in which the
facts were carefully re-
searched and have not
been denied—it is stated
on good authority that the
father of the candidate
"made $100 million in New
York real estate alone."
Thus Congress gives and
landowners receive. That
sort of thing is why cities
pretend to be unable to
remedy traffic conditions
and eliminate slums and
the mayors run to Wash-
ington for help.
This should be a legiti-
mate concern for candi-
dates this year. Before the
federal government pours
money into cities, it should
be determined whether
they are operating a just
and efficient system of
land assessment and taxa-
in their midst, to be cap- tion.
