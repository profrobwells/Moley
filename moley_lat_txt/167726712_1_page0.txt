RAYMOND MOLEY:
Medical Aid Plans
Lack Factual Basis
With only weeks left of
this session of Congress,
there is small chance of
any legislation for the
medical needs of the elderly
being passed and ap-
proved.
If Congress passes the
jerry-built plan introduced
by the three Democratic
candidates, Kennedy,
Humphrey and Symington,
and by McNamara,
who faces a hard campaign
in Michigan for re-election
to the Senate, the President
is certain to veto it.
And Congress certainly
will not pass the administration
measure.
*
The need for something
is real but it might be just
as well to have it go over
to the new Congress, when
there will be less confusion
and less political
competition for votes.
Meanwhile, it is very important
that both the President
and Congress devise
some orderly way to explore
the subject and bring
in some vital facts.
Obviously, the administration's
plan is the result
of compromise and hasty
improvisation. For, according
to reports, Secretary
Flemming wanted a
different sort of bill and so
did his more conservative
brethren.
Any television viewer
who saw and heard Sen.
McNamara—whose subcommittee
has traveled far
and wide gathering information
on the problems of
the aged—expound his
conclusions must have
been shocked at his naivete.
*
He kept repeating that
what his bill and the Forand
bill seek is "prepaid"
health insurance. The political
purpose of this claim
is to reassure those millions
under 65 that the
money taken in additional
Social Security taxes is
buying them something in
the future as well as providing
for people who are
over 65.
This idea of "prepayment"
for security in old
age was a major argument
when the Social Security
Act was passed in
1935 and when it went into
effect in 1937. But consider
what those who were
taxed then got in "prepayment."
The dollars
they then put into their
so-called equity in the
trust fund are now worth
52 cents.
I wish that the "Mr. 42"
of 1937 might talk to the
man who is "Mr. 42" of
today. He would tell him
of the bitter disappointment
he suffered as he
saw inflation eat away the
value of his savings as
well as his equity in Social
Security.
What assurance could
the man of 42 now have
that this promise of "prepaid"
health insurance
would not prove to be
another illusion, especially
since the Forand bill and
other spending proposals
of the "liberals" would
certainly keep the cycle
of inflation moving?
There are other unanswered
questions. Why
not consider several forms
of tax deductions which,
so far as I have seen, are
ignored in all bills on
medical care before Congress?
*
How about a tax deduction
for children who
want to buy insurance for
their aged parents or contribute
to the cost of the
care themselves? This
goes to the heart of a
moral obligation as old as
the human race.
Also, a tax deduction for
physicians who provide
medical aid without compensation?
This has been
a moral obligation for the
medical profession since
Hippocrates.
Or a more liberal tax
break for employers who
set up programs for their
employees and ex-employees?
A tax deduction is always
to be preferred to
direct outlays by the federal
government. For it
emphasizes self-help and
causes less enlargement of
the federal bureaucracy.
Moreover, the estimated
costs of all plans now before
Congress are completely
without reliability.
The British National
Health Service has cost
vastly more than the estimates.
No one can ever
calculate what a free service
will cost, because so
many will take advantage
of it who are not in need.
*
It is reliably calculated
by experts who are independent
that the proposed
$1.2 billion should be at
least $2.5 billion the first
year and that the cost
would rapidly mount after
that. For, when the service
is free, uncounted
thousands will immediately
drop the insurance they
are now carrying.
What is needed are
more facts, rather than
the oratory of a campaign
year.
