Kennedy-Forand Plan Would Hurt
a Majority of Citizens Over 65
Since Aesop died, 2,520
years ago, it is impossible
to know what was in his
mind when he wrote the
fable about the dog that
dropped his bone when he
saw the shadow of a bone
on the water, but the les-
son drawn from the story
over the centuries is that
human beings often drop
the substance for the sha-
dow.
This lesson applies to
that large and growing
segment of the population
which has passed age 65.
The appeal to this group,
so numerous in votes, by
the medical aid bills intro-
duced by Sen. Kennedy
and Rep. Forand is in line
with the fable.
Let us first examine the
nature and economic sta-
tus of this group which
has suddenly attracted
the interest of politicians.
There are now more than
16 million Americans 65
or over. Of these, 4 million
are gainfully employed. If
we consider that most are
married to women of their
own age, a considerable
number are enjoying the
same economic status as
other members of the pop-
ulation.
Eleven million are eli-
gible for old age and sur-
vivors insurance benefits.
A fairly large number of
these who have passed 72
get the benefits whether
they are earning a good in-
come or not. I know of one
man whose fortune ex-
ceeds $50 million who has
been drawing the benefits
for three years. The Ken-
nedy-Forand plan would
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
not reach 2 million now
on old age assistance or
the 2.5 million who are
not getting OASI or old
age-assistance.
The property ownership
of a considerable majority
of those over 65 is consid-
erable. Seventy per cent
of those receiving OASI
benefits own their own
homes, 87% of which are
mortgage free. This must
be taken into considera-
tion as income and prop-
erty.
Moreover, the median
net worth of all retired
people increased in the six
years between 1951 and
1957 from $5,610 to $9,616.
This does not include the
cash surrender value of
the life insurance policies
owned by the aged. In nine
years the median income
of men over 65 has in-
creased by 50%, while that
of younger men has in-
creased only 25%.
It is probable that not
more than 12% of the
people over 65 can be
classed as the genuinely
needy poor. And there are
many provisions already in
existence which provide
assistance for them.
But every person with
savings, with insurance,
with some sort of private
pension, and with OASI
benefits is mortally endan-
gered by inflation. This
danger is what President
Eisenhower is thinking
about when he opposes
not only the Kennedy-For-
and plan but other pro-
posals to spend federal
money for some sort of aid
for the elderly. They are a
greater danger to retired
people than to those now
employed who, with the
increase of inflation, are
likely to get more income.
But the Kennedy-For-
and plan would extend a
service indiscriminately to
all who are getting OASI
benefits. Some will need it;
most will not. But the cost
will be exacted from the
millions who are paying
the taxes to provide the
money needed for the pro-
posed service.
No doubt, with increased
medical costs there are
many who need assistance
of some kind beyond what
is already provided. The
nation is rich enough to
meet those needs. But the
Kennedy-Forand approach
would worsen the situa-
tion of the genuinely
needy, while it would scat-
ter money over millions
who do not need it. It is
not a real effort to isolate
a need and to provide a
specific remedy. It is, as
Rep. Thomas Curtis called
it, "a grapeshot blast at a
smoke-shrouded target."
It is a blast designed to
bag as many votes in an
election year as possible.
And the hearings on the
Forand bill have amply
proved that even the spon-
sors of the plan have not
thought out the measure.
Another aspect of the
matter is the extent to
which through govern-
ments—federal, state and
local—and through pri-
vate plans the problem of
medical care for the elder-
ly is already being solved.
I shall consider that in a
subsequent article.
