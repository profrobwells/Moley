'New Frontier' Housing Program
Would Infringe Upon Freedoms
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
As the special session
of Congress gets under
way, it should be noted
that it is a wholly un-
necessary affair. The Sen-
ate majority frittered its
time away for nearly six
months when all the
measures now booked for
passage could have been
acted upon.
It was planned to hold
important legislation in
abeyance for the purpose
of a hurry-up session for
political ammunition. The
special session will enable
members, intent on pro-
moting their chances for
success at the polls in
November, promiscuously
to give handouts to var-
ious groups of voters.
Thus a challenge is of-
fered to a responsible
President either to yield
to vote getting by approv-
ing legislation or be
blamed in the campaign
for neglect of the poor
and needy while serving
the opulent rich.

Certain housing bills
are one of the best ex-
amples of legislation
which not only is reckless
and unsound but is of
such importance that it
should not be passed in
the hurried hours of the
dog days.
One of these, with a
price tag of $1.732 bil-
lion, is S-3670. It not only
authorizes 25,000 new
public housing units but
moves into the middle-in-
come area by permitting
families who have pres-
ent public housing to get
subsidized homes. The
bill was passed by the
Senate in June.
Hot on the heels of this
bill is another, S-1342,
sponsored by Sens. Javits
and Clark, to create an-
other housing bureaucra-
cy to make direct loans
to private, nonprofit and
limited-profit corporations
to provide housing for
middle-income people.
Since this sort of lend-
ing could go on and on, it
opens the way to even
more mischief than the
bill already passed,
S-3670. Many billions of
government loans would
go into this plan.
An examination of
these bills shows how far
welfarism has moved
toward a completely
nursemaid state since the
early housing legislation
in the Roosevelt adminis-
tration. At that time there
was depression, and it
was of the essence to
stimulate the heavy in-
dustries.
*
Since housing would
have a major effect upon
all industry and there had
been a great accumula-
tion of need for housing
in the depression years, a
moderate law was passed
which, through the guar-
antee of mortgages,
helped those who were
anxious to help them-
selves. This has served
well.
The New Deal is far
behind now â€” the New
Deal that saw candidate
Kennedy as a teen-ager.
It is now the New Fron-
tier, which would regard
the Roosevelt revolution
as rank reaction.
Now, instead of the fed-
eral government's seeing
to it that no one should
be in need, the immense
task of providing subsidies
for one and all is assumed.
Need is no longer the
measure of federal wel-
fare. It is regarded by the
New Frontiersmen as a
degrading matter.
The assets of those who
would benefit by the Jav-
its-Clark bill are disregard-
ed in providing loans.
Those assets amount to al-
most a trillion dollars, or
three times as much as in
1950. The individuals who
will get the benefit have
money in the bank, shares
in savings and loans as-
sociations, stocks and
bonds and real estate.
Under the proposal
these assets need not be
touched. This reverses the
custom from time imme-
morial that such assets are
used to buy homes.
Another factor is dis-
regarded in offering hand-
outs for loans in this way.
The usual course is that
as those with middle in-
comes dispose of their
former homes to move
into new quarters, there
is housing available for
lower-income families.
The proponents of the
New Frontier contemp-
tuously call this process
"filtering down." But by
making sure that every-
body must have not only
a good home but a new
home at federal expense
the bottom drops out of
the value of the property
from which a family
moves. It is thus robbed
with one hand while it
gets a "benefit" from
another.
*
But in the new dispen-
sation the rich get a wind-
fall, too. They can buy
tax-exempt bonds which
are issued to meet the
costs. These compete with
the bonds and notes of
the federal government
and lay another burden
on the taxpayer.
There are also the large
estates with land lying
under slum properties and
escaping adequate taxa-
tion. The speculative prof-
it when federal housing
comes in adds riches to
riches and also is creating
a new rich class which
neither by labor nor imag-
ination has helped itself.
But no government
handout is without its ad-
ditional horde of super-
visors and its encroach-
ments on liberty. For in-
comes must be supervised
to see that low incomes
do not move into higher
incomes and thus create
ineligibility for low, sub-
sidized rent. This is what
the Congress, marching
with the watchwords
New Frontier, is working
on in Washington.
