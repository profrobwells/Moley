Political Businessmen Undertake
a New and Potent Campaign Role
A new and incalculable
element will appear in the
results of this general
election which may have
great significance. This is
the movement, now wide-
spread among business
firms, in developing pro-
grams in political educa-
tion.
There is little that sug-
gests a pro-management or
anti-labor intent in this,
and the methods adopted
are perfectly legal. The ob-
jective is to get as many
individuals as possible
with some managerial
competence and education
to do what is the manifest
duty of every American.
For the quality of our
political parties and gov-
ernment will depend upon
the number and variety of
those who actively partici-
pate in politics.
This awakening of man-
agement to its duty, how-
ever, stems in considerable
part from the example of
the labor unions that have
had spectacular success in
mobilizing the strength of
their members in behalf of
chosen candidates and is-
sues.

Until that power began
"to make itself felt, there
had been regrettable leth-
argy in political campaigns
among people who not
only had real talents to
help but had the most to
lose by a spendthrift gov-
ernment.
Since Ohio has in past
elections tended to indi-
cate the trend nationally, I
have had my assistant,
Raymond Moley Jr., visit
the Cleveland area and re-
port on the progress of the
various programs of politi-
cal education initiated by
business firms there.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A sense of political re-
sponsibility in that area
has been alive among busi-
nessmen for several years.
In 1950 the labor unions
mobilized enormous efforts
in money and manpower to
try to defeat the late Sen.
Taft, who had mortally of-
fended labor leaders by
sponsoring and putting
through the Taft-Hartley
Act in 1947.
Businessmen all over
the state exerted prodi-
gious efforts to get a big
vote to the polls, and the
result was that Taft car-
ried every industrial coun-
ty.
★
Since then, the influ-
ence of businessmen in
elections has been vari-
able. The conservative
Democrat, Frank Lausche,
generally supported by
businessmen, held the
governorship until elected
to the Senate. Lausche
was succeeded in the gov-
ernorship by William
O'Neil, a Republican. Sen.
John Bricker, a perennial
winner, was re-elected in
1952.
But in 1958, largely be-
cause a right-to-work
amendment was put on
the ballot without suffi-
cient organized effort to
promote it, there was a
devastating Republican
defeat all over the state.
From that experience,
Ohio businessmen have
had a severe and costly
lesson.
In the Cleveland area a
number of firms have
specific programs for stim-
ulating salaried em-
ployees to get into politi-
cal activity. Among these
are Republic Steel, Ford
Motor, Ohio Bell Tele-
phone, Diamond Alkali,
General Electric, Cleve-
land Graphite Bronze,
Ohio Standard Oil, and the
Glidden Co.
The Republic Steel
plan is very carefully pre-
pared and elaborate. Its
material, completely non-
partisan, could be used not
only among employees of
the company but in col-
leges, schools, and civic
groups.
Also, the U. S. Chamber
of Commerce's course in
practical politics is widely
used through Ohio.
The Ford Motor pro-
gram, which reaches sev-
eral Ford plants in Ohio,
comprises three parts:
the collection of contri-
butions from employees,
to be given to the party
designated by the donor;
an "effective citizenship
course" for salaried em-
ployees, and a "volunteers
program," which recruits
workers for the parties.
★
Many hundreds of peo-
ple have had some sort
of training for effective
citizenship through these
efforts.
But it is emphasized
that a "crash program"
for this year alone is not
enough. Most of the
efforts look to the long
pull two, four, six or eight
years ahead.
Wise businessmen re-
alize that, after their vic-
tory in 1950 and with
Taft re-elected, many felt
that they had done
enough and resumed the
old apathy. This time,
they are determined that
their efforts shall have
permanent results.
