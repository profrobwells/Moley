RAYMOND MOLEY:
Schlesinger Misses the Point
The publication of one
of Arthur M. Schlesinger
Jr.'s series of books on
"The Age of Roosevelt"
becomes a political event
for at least two reasons.
Schlesinger has become
a politician in his own
right, although. he holds a
professorship at Harvard.
That is not unusual among
present-day members of
that faculty. But Schles-
inger is perhaps the most
active Democratic
and
Americans for Democratic
Action pamphleteer and
adviser of candidates.
Also, there is so much
of present Democratic pol-
icy that is rooted or bor-
rowed from the Roosevelt
days that the origins be-
come important to the
understanding of what
candidate Kennedy is
talking about.
In principle, there is
nothing much new in the
basic programs advocated
by the dominant liberal
Democrats. The differ-
ences are in emphasis and
details.
*
Like Schlesinger's carli-
er books, his new volume,
"The Politics of Upheav-
al," is most readable, viv-
id, racy and interesting.
Covering the years 1935-
1936, he describes the
transition from the first
to the second New Deal.
He is right in making
that distinction. At the
time it was happening,
when I was, as Schlesinger
is now, a professor-politi-
cian and very close to the
scene, I noted the change
and called the new tack
the "second New Deal."
I may add that the Pres-
ident suddenly turned in
his course at least 90 deg.
Schlesinger notes in his
book that I abandoned the
new and strange Demo-
cratic Party that was in
the course of construction.
There were certain cir-
cumstances that changed
the President's direction,
however, that Schlesinger
fails to note. And they
were the decisive ones.
*
After the great victories
of Roosevelt and the Dem-
ocratic Party in 1932 and
1934—victories entirely
due to depression condi-
tions and the country's
confidence that Roosevelt
was at any rate trying
something new—he and
the late Edward J. Flynn
sat down for a serious look
at the future.
Schlesinger fails to real-
ize the enormous impor-
tance of Flynn in the
Roosevelt era. For he not
only was closer politically
to the President than Far-
ley or anyone else, but he
was one of the most ac-
complished strategists of
his time.
Louis Howe, the Presi-
dent's old faithful Father
Joseph, was on his death-
bed. Many of the rest of
us who had been through
the battles of 1932 and
1934 were drifting away.
But Flynn, secure in his
grip on New York, was in
charge.
*
As Flynn told me at the
time, his argument ran
this way: By all past meas-
urements the Democratic
Party was a minority. Its
old fortresses in the South
and elsewhere were de-
clining. Something must
be done to mobilize the
discontented, the city mi-
norities and the labor
unions. This meant drop-
ping the old principles of
the party—states' rights,
limitation of power, order-
ly change.
There were, Flynn said,
about 7 million votes to be
gathered into the Demo-
cratic Party by a radical
turn to the left. And so,
in 1935, the strategy
changed.
In that year all of the
major legislation was pro-
city masses and anti-busi-
ness—the Wagner Act, So-
cial Security, the holding
company legislation, and
more money for public
power and public works.
*
The proof of this is the
fact that from 1936 on, the
Roosevelt vote increased
greatly in the big cities,
and declined in the coun-
try counties and the small
towns.
Most important was the
birth of the CIO, under the
patronage and encourage-
ment of the Roosevelt ad-
ministration. This was be-
cause the CIO was vertical
unionism and vertical un-
ionism is inevitably politi-
cal.
Ultimately, and up to
the present, the political
labor unions and the Dem-
ocratic Party (the domi-
nant liberal wing) are as
one.
Together with other mi-
nority groups and pres-
sure agencies such as pub-
lic power, etc., they domi-
nate the scene. The South
became a prisoner in its
one-party system.
*
All this Schlesinger
misses. He conceives the
change as merely an ideo-
logical one. President
Roosevelt cared very little
for ideological niceties. He
was interested in votes
and, with Flynn, decided
that to win you get there
first where there are the
"mostest votes."
The new strategy
worked for many years,
but the Democratic Party
of Al Smith, Wilson and
Cleveland died in the proc-
ess.
