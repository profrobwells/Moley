RAYMOND MOLEY:
Election Machinery
Needs an Overhaul
The serious charges of
errors and frauds in some
of the states in this elec-
tion merely bring to a head
a peril that has threatened
our electoral system for
many years.
A number of these
charges if substantiated
would change the result
and elect Nixon. There is
little chance that an en-
tirely revised and clear
count of all of the millions
of votes in close states can
ever be made.
It takes a lot of money
to get recounts, and with
the difficulty of such re-
checking of incomplete
and faulty records, that
may leave the whole mat-
ter in a state of confusion.
This will raise in the
minds of many people
doubts and sinister shad-
ows which should never
be present to haunt a re-
sponsible President or
Vice President.

It is reported that, while
the Republican National
Committee is taking steps
to clear up things, Vice
President Nixon has not
participated.
It is not Nixon but Sen.
Kennedy who should be
concerned and, while he
cannot well get into a
squabble with his party
leaders in the states which
gave him majorities, his
efforts should be to make
certain that this sort of
thing cannot happen
again. Indeed, it should be
the first business of Con-
gress to consider new leg-
islation to prevent any-
thing like this from hap-
pening again.
It was the insistence of
Kennedy again and again
that our prestige abroad
was vital to our interna-
tional position and our na-
tional security. He also
said that many new na-
tions emerging into the
light of self-government
should be looking to us
rather than to commu-
nism and dictatorships
for inspiration.

It can be validly disput-
ed whether their knowl-
edge and judgment of rel-
ative economic and mili-
tary power are of any value
to us. But if we are re-
vealed to the world as un-
able, after nearly two cen-
turies, to conduct an accu-
rate and honest election,
their confidence in the
United States will really
be shaken. For they are in
most cases just beginning
to govern themselves.
Many of the older mem-
bers of the United Nations,
especially in Latin Amer-
ica, have considerable dif-
ficulty in determining who
is rightfully in authority
after a century and some
decades of trying.
★
In anything but a close
election, the shenanigans
that go on in some of our
cities and states are over-
looked. But in 1960 it
proves to be a quite dif-
ferent matter.
Members of both parties
have been strident in con-
demning restrictions and
in attempting to assure
the Negroes in the South
a valid vote. And federal
authority is invoked in
many laws to provide
some sort of federal in-
spection and authority in
that instance. Also, these
alleged injustices to
American citizens have
been spread among Com-
munist countries as a blot
upon us.
To cite an example of a
crying injustice which has
nothing to do with fraud,
no less than 8 million citi-
zens were barred from vot-
ing for President this year
because of absurd resi-
dence requirements fixed
by 47 states.
★
There should be federal
legislation granting at
least a Presidential vote to
all residents where they
are after no more than 30
days. Let the states fix
what they will as residence
requirements for state and
local offices, even for the
House and Senate.
To assure honesty and
accuracy, there should be
some effective federal in-
spection of all elections for
federal offices in every
state, and this inspection
should be backed up by
stiff checks and penalties
for violations.
Let us overhaul our
electoral system so that
the world can see that we
are really capable of prac-
ticing what we preach and
so that Americans can get
what they vote for.
