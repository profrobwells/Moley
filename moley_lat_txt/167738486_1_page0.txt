RAYMOND MOLEY:
New York Unfairly
Burdened by U.N.
In great tragedies, such
as "Hamlet" and "Mac-
beth," master writers in-
troduce relieving pieces
of comedy.
New York City is wit-
ness to a stage on which
there is playing a tre-
mendous cast of stars,
among them Khrushchev
himself, Wladyslaw Gom-
ulka, Kadar of Hungary,
Gamal Nasser, Marshal
Tito, Sukarno of Indonesia,
President Eisenhow-
er and Fidel Castro.
A considerable part of
the audience is vehement-
ly hissing the villains, like
ringsiders at a wrestling
match. Hundreds of
thousands of others share
the hatred, but restrain
the hissing. Some ludi-
crous antics maintain in-
terest and provoke merri-
ment. But over all there
loom ominous forebodings
of things to come.
One serious factor de-
serves to be mentioned
before we come to the
comedy.
*
The burden of the im-
mense job of security
falls upon the New York
City police force, more
than 23,000 strong. This
is perhaps its most diffi-
cult as well as its finest
hour. But a certain ob-
servation should be made
about why this job should
be assumed by any city
police department.
The issue was cogently
raised by a taxi driver
who was taking me home
from the Idlewild Air-
port. In substance, he said
this:
"Why should we citi-
zens of New York be re-
quired to take on this ex-
pense, responsibility, and
inconvenience?
"Washington ought to
take care of this. After
all, it was our State De-
partment that brought the
United Nations here,
where it never should
have been located any-
how.
"The police protection
in the other boroughs -
the Bronx, Brooklyn, and
Queens - is so thinned
out that there are more
holdups, burglaries, and
small crime than ever be-
fore."
*
Substantially, that is
what I feel. Perhaps some
compensation in money is
given to the city for
dumping this show in our
midst. I don't know about
that.
But there is the plain
fact that the New York
city government is sup-
ported at very great ex-
pense to look after some
local problems that cry
out for attention.
There is the other fact
that mid-Manhattan is a
place where a lot of peo-
ple have to work and earn
a living.
Those who are not pres-
sent here among those
workers cannot realize
what it means to live in
a mess like this. Streets
are barred off. Pickets and
protesters and curiosity
seekers are on a score of
streets and corners. The
United Nations, of course,
should never have been
located here, but that is
water over the dam.
If the federal govern-
ment is going to carry
the quest for mutual se-
curity to this length, it
ought to use a few mil-
lions to provide a federal
force capable of taking
over the job now imposed
upon New York, even
though it is true that the
tragicomedy is better for
free than what thousands
are paying for at Broad-
way theaters.
