Executive Bypass of the Connally
Amendment Perils U.S. Interests
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Having failed to get the
Humphrey repeal of the
Connally Amendment off
the ground this year, the
State Department is now
attempting to bypass it
through executive agree-
ments.
Such an executive
agreement, which would
supersede the Constitu-
tion and the laws, would
place a large part of our
rights on the seas under
the compulsory jurisdic-
tion of the World Court.
As was pointed out,
when the attempt was
made to repeal the Con-
nally Amendment, we
have only one judge on
that court while the Com-
munists have two and the
Soviet has never sub-
scribed to the World
Court at all.
*
In the executive agree-
ment in question there
are four "conventions"
and a protocol. The con-
ventions cover a wide
range of subjects in
which controversy may
arise between the U.S.
and practically any sea-
going nation.
Some of the subjects
distinctly belonging with-
in our sovereignty. Very
important are the control
of resources in territorial
waters, fishing rights, and
labor conditions.
Fishing rights have tra-
ditionally been deter-
mined by specific treaties
between us and specific
nations and the control of
labor conditions on the
seas would practically
place under bodies in the
United Nations and the
World Court issues which
might, if decided against
us, greatly cripple our
merchant marine and
those nations such as Pa-
nama and Liberia which
register so many Ameri-
can-owned ships.
*
There has been trouble
enough in that field al-
ready with certain mari-
time nations in Europe
co-operating with Ameri-
can maritime unions to
get such ships, flying the
so-called "flags of neces-
sity," to register under
the flags of Britain or the
Scandinavian countries.
That would deny us the
use of them in case of
war.
One of the most serious
aspects of such an agree-
ment concerns "territori-
al waters." Consider the
closeness of the United
States to Cuba, which
seems at the moment des-
tined to be a Soviet sat-
ellite. We have a great
naval base there. There
are also considerable
properties still owned by
Americans.
On the slightest pretext,
Cuba, which has already
joined in this protocol,
could, under the influence
of the Soviet, drag us into
the World Court. Under
such an agreement we
would be powerless to
sustain our legitimate
rights to the south.
There has been some-
thing very covert and
tricky about the way this
executive agreement has
been managed in the Sen-
ate, where, in order to be
valid, there must be a
two-thirds majority for it.
All of the conventions
and the protocol were
suddenly brought togeth-
er for a vote. The
package deal was accept-
ed. But there were de-
mands for a reconsidera-
tion of the protocol and
the vote was 49 in favor,
30 against and 21 not
voting. Since such a mat-
ter requires two thirds of
the members present and
voting, it was lost.
*
Other senators were
alerted to the fact that
the right of the United
States to determine what
matters were of purely
domestic concern in in-
ternational disputes
should remain where it is,
under the Connally
Amendment, in the Unit-
ed States alone.
The present danger is
that in the rush to ad-
journ, this vital question
may be slipped through
with insufficient warning
and consideration. As the
end of the session ap-
proaches, haste, confusion
and politics will muddy
the waters. And those
who would surrender our
sovereign rights love to
operate in such waters.
