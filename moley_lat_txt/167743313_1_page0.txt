RAYMOND MOLEY:
The GOP Outlook Is
Bright in Michigan
All national candidates
will be in orbit around the
vital state of Michigan in
this campaign. Both Ken-
nedy and Nixon have al-
ready appeared and prom-
ised return visits. A re-
port from a reliable ob-
server says that Nixon had
far the more enthusiastic
reception.
This is further confir-
mation of a report by my
editorial assistant, Ray-
mond Moley Jr., who vis-
ited the state last week.
He says that the Republi-
cans are confident that
they can turn out the state
administration, solidly held
for 11 years by the Demo-
crats, win control of the
Legislature and defeat
Sen. McNamara, who is
running for re-election.

To begin with, the Re-
publicans have an able,
hard-working organization
under state chairman
Lawrence B. Lindemer. As
a candidate for governor,
they have Paul D. Bag-
well, who gave Gov. Men-
nen Williams a big scare
in the 1958 Democratic
year.
Bagwell is in the "fa-
vorite 40s" age range, is a
very articulate and active
campaigner and has had
his name before the people
of the state for a consid-
erable time. He is a pro-
fessor at Michigan State.
He had an enormous vote
in the primary.
The infant prodigy of
the Democrats, Mennen
Williams, is no longer an
infant nor, in the minds
of Michigan voters, a
prodigy. This year he de-
cided to retire, and Lt.
Gov. John B. Swainson is
running for governor on
the Democratic ticket.
★
His nomination in the
primary was not endorsed
by Gus Scholle, Democrat-
ic machine leader and
president of the Michigan
AFL-CIO. But union
voters preferred Swainson
to Secretary of State
James M. Hare, who has
hitherto been the best
vote getter.
Bagwell and other Re-
publican candidates are
stressing the issues which
almost won for them two
years ago. These go to the
vital interests of the state.
They concern the well-ad-
vertised economic illness
from which the state has
been suffering for some
time.
Michigan not only has
failed to get its quota of
new industries but has
been losing what it had. A
reputation for a bad busi-
ness climate has caused in-
vestors and new industries
to look elsewhere.
Inordinately high unem-
ployment compensation,
high corporation and busi-
ness taxes and the virtual
union-leader control of the
state government during
this decline have shaken
faith in Walter Reuther's
socialistic nostrums.
Chronic unemployment
has resulted, although re-
sponsible studies of Michi-
gan's economic potential
show that there should be
an increase in jobs of 100,-
000 a year.
Fiscal affairs have been
a mess for some time.
"Williams took over a sur-
plus," said a Statehouse
reporter, "but is leaving a
deficit."
With a bankrupt state
treasury, state employees
have "payless paydays."
Retailers with bills long
due refuse to deliver gro-
ceries to state institutions.
The veterans trust fund
and other state assets have
long been liquidated.
★
Defeats this year in
Michigan will be a bitter
cup to labor politicians,
for the state has been their
show place for years. There
it was that labor politi-
cians really took over the
government. There Reu-
ther tried out and perfected
the sort of efficient
political methods that have
proved their power in
many other states and
congressional districts.
It was in Michigan that
the political capacity orig-
inated that now dominates
the liberal majority in the
Democratic Party with a
veto on Presidential nomi-
nations and already has
placed a majority of the
members of Congress un-
der decisive obligation to
labor votes.
But as is always the
way, power breeds arro-
gance, and arrogance be-
trays judgment. Time has
not mellowed the Reu-
thers and the Scholles. It
has seen more and more
mistakes in tactics.
★
Democratic harmony
has been marred by at-
tempts to punish public
officials who have devi-
ated once or twice. But
there is still no justifica-
tion for Republican com-
placency in Michigan or
anywhere else. The labor
leaders may have lost a
tooth or two but, like a
well-fed bear, they are
skillful and strong.
