Unions Oppose Jobs
for Elderly Citizens
Since the Landrum-Grif-
fin Act of 1959 was
passed, the labor bosses
have been seeking some
means to win back public
favor.
"Sure," they may say,
"we have had a few crooks
in our midst, But our
hearts are in the right
place, Sce how much we
care for the old folks. All
we need is to have a few
penny-pinching congress-
men pass the Forand bill.
This will be our tribute to
old age."
However, the AFL-CIO
has not only opposed cre-
ating more work oppor-
tunities for these senior
citizens but it has active-
ly worked to promote re-
tirement. Its locals have
also incorporated many
provisions in labor con-
tracts for compulsory re-
tirement.
And the bosses have
thrown their whole weight
against any liberalization
of the retirement test
which permits most OASI
beneficiaries to earn no
more than $1,200 a year
in useful work,
Rep. Albert H. Bosch
stated on the floor of the
House in March:
"I have received a letter
dated March 25, 1960, from
the AFL-CIO opposing the
more than 175 bills pend-
ing before the Committee
on Ways and Means which
would liberalize the re-
tirement test so as to al-
low beneficiaries to earn
more than the $1,200 year-
ly without loss of benefit
entitlement.
"In its opposition to im-
proving the economic op-
portunities for our aged,
the AFL-CIO contends
that this meritorious im-
provement would be dis-
criminatory, costly and
counter to the basic pur-
pose of the system.
"In short, the AFL-CIO
would deny to our aged
-citizens the right to work
and would force them to
rely solely on the bounty
of the federal, state and
local governments for
their economic survival."
All, young and old, but
especially those who are
past 65, want beyond all
things to feel themselves
useful useful to them-
selves, their friends and
family, to society. Science
has given time over the
last half century years
more of life and of vigor.
To dump people on the
shuffleboard court and
then to throw them a gov-
ernment dole is a bitter re-
ward for their years of
life. I have no doubt that
the attempts of organiza-
tions to "retrain" retired
people are inspired by the
most humane and worthy
motives.
But I suspect that most
people would rather go on
with at least a lightened
load of the work to which
they have given their lives
than to be trained to make
homemade pottery or op-
erate hand looms.
Dr. Frederick C. Swartz,
chairman of the American
Medical Assn.'s Committee
on the Aging, put the case
well:
"It has been my expe-
rience that the aged want
just about the same things
that all the rest of us do:
to be part and parcel of
their environment; to feel
that their skills and tal-
ents have value and can
still be used; to be pro-
ductive, to be loved, to be-
long
"Consider, for example,
the field of employment
where compulsory retire-
ment policies often under-
mine the individual's ego,
his will to live, his feeling
of usefulness. Able and
anxious to work, he fre-
quently finds his abilities
no longer in demand. Un-
necessarily placed on the
shelf, he feels as if he has
been cashiered out of the
human army without
rank, weapons, medals or
identification."
No doubt Sen. McNa-
mara, who will turn 66 in
October, would be terribly
distressed if the voters of
Michigan should decide
that he should be retired
from the Senate. No doubt
he will tell them before
the election that he is get-
ting more useful every
year, what with his labors
through his subcommittee
to understand the prob-
lems of the aged.
Perhaps those voters
might decide that the best
way he can understand
what it means to be
shelved is to give him
some firsthand experience
in the role of a retired
statesman, with nothing
to do but write to his old
friends in Washington.
But the AFL in which he
was employed for many
years is committed to the
idea that the age he has
reached is the end of use-
fulness.
