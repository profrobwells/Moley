RAYMOND MOLEY:
Stevenson's Ideas
on National Purposes
From now on until July
and perhaps later, the po-
litical atmosphere will be
graced with sundry essays
by Adlai Stevenson. He
seems to have arrived at
the conceit that to start re-
building the United States
he should be employed as
the architect.
Running through all his
utterances, spoken and
written, is his dismay that
the United States under
Republican executive lead-
ership has drifted into aim-
less and uncharted space.
"Purpose" is his favorite
word, but the idea is set
forth in many different ar-
rangements of words. Oth-
er favorite words are "res-
olute," "firm," "driving,"
etc.
A number of choice ex-
amples can be found in a
great rumble-mumble of
words which he contribut-
ed in a recent article (pub-
lished in The Times) under
the title, "Our Goals: Na-
tional Purpose."
It is difficult, in review-
ing the facts of Stevenson's
life, to find that he ever
had a consuming purpose
except to have a good fo-
rum for the graceful ex-
pression of platitudes. The
fact is that he has been liv-
ing in a draft all his life.
Most of the following
facts are drawn from the
most revealing book by his
sister, Elizabeth Stevenson
Ives, "My Brother Adlai."
His grandfather drafted
him to go to Choate "be-
cause it would give him
the solid preparation need-
ed to get into Princeton."
After Princeton, his father
decided that he should go
to Harvard Law School.
The training there was
very rigorous, and after
one year and a part of a
second year, Adlai dropped
out to return to Illinois.
There he spent a while
writing for the family pa-
per. The academic record
at all three schools was
undistinguished.
His sense of "direction"
while at Harvard Law
School is revealed by his
sister in these terms: "Ad
told me a few nights ago
he wanted to go to law
school one year, then Ox-
ford one year, and then
work on a London news-
paper one yearâ€”and if in
the end he chose to join
the reorganizers of the dip-
lomatic corps, would fa-
ther be very mad?"
This is the record of a
man who said in his recent
article, "We need a
reorientation of our ideals
and tastes, the strenuous
stretching of mental and
artistic talent, the exalta-
tion of excellence above
social approval, and of
mental achievement above
quick material success."
After a few years finish-
ing the study of law, writ-
ing for the family paper
and casually practicing,
Stevenson in 1933 was
"drafted" by George Peek
for the Agriculture Ad-
justment Administration
in Washington. The next
draft was when Frank
Knox, secretary of the
navy, called him to Wash-
ington to do odd jobs in
his office. In many in-
stances in between, there
were small missions in
foreign affairs. Then Ste-
venson was "drafted" to
run for governor of Illi-
nois by the bosses, includ-
ing Jake Arvey. Finally,
some friends contrived a
"draft" for the Presiden-
tial nomination in 1952.
Other interesting phras-
es in the article are, "great
embracing national pur-
pose," "dedication to the
goal," "prepared to face
rigors," "in terms of diffi-
culties overcome," and
"firm purpose."
Since these animadver-
sions about our national
and governmental incapac-
ity to work hard and to
have a "purpose" are di-
rectly and by inference
meant to be criticisms of
President Eisenhower,
there is invited a compari-
son of the life of this dilet-
tante with the career of
Dwight Eisenhower as de-
picted in any of his biog-
raphies. That is the story
of a man who labored pro-
digiously to become a bet-
ter and better soldier, a
man of excellence in his
academic achievements, of
drive and direction.
The test of personal
character is valid, especial-
ly when a man is seeking
great responsible office
through downgrading the
people whom he wants to
supplant.
