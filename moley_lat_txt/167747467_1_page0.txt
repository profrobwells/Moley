The Important Campaign Issues
Have No Concern With Religion
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Since any mention of the
religious question by a
political commentator this
year is likely to bring a
shower of irrational letters
from both sides, the temp-
tation is to ignore it.
The state of mind of so
many is so inflamed that
rational appeals have little
influence. The fuse is
ignited and the fire will
run its course, with what-
ever benefit to either
candidate yet to be deter-
mined.
As a major element
determining the outcome,
it may well sputter out. If
so, the real issues will
emerge â€” issues that are
really important to the
future of the country.

I can evaluate this con-
troversy with a consider-
able amount of experience
and reflection to guide me.
I am old enough to have
seen the matter flare up
before, even before the
Klan in the 1920s and the
Hoover-Smith campaign in
1928.
My religious inheritance
and membership were
Roman Catholic. My pre-
dominant religious prefer-
ence and affection are for
that faith. I have heard
fine ministers of that
church tell young Catho-
lics that they should not
consider their religion to
be a bar to their success.
"Make good," they said,
"in your chosen work and
you will be recognized.
Don't think that everyone
who opposes you or fails
to give you a job is a bigot.
Don't carry a religious
chip on your shoulder."
I heard a Catholic bishop
say on the day of my con-
firmation, concerning bel-
ligerency, "There are a lot
of Catholics who will stand
up for their faith who will
not kneel down for it."
From that background, I
have given my life to the
study of politics at all
levels, and certain basic
truths have appeared to
me. They might be called
basic principles of politics.
A most important one is
that the less there is to
choose between two par-
ties or candidates the more
their religious preferences
will count in the mind of
the voters.
So far as a choice in
politics is concerned, the
preference should be
guided by temporal mat-
ters affecting the sound-
ness of the body politic,
the economic policies in-
volved, and the like.
I have also expressed
regret that in certain
states the Catholic clergy
plunged into the right-to-
work campaigns two years
ago. Again I was assailed
in nine out of 10 letters
from clergymen. They said
that, since they are sup-
posed to be leaders of
opinion, they had a duty
to express opinions on ev-
erything.
*
My convictions on that
score remained, however,
since I do not think that
the training of a clergy-
man fits him to be a polit-
ical leader. "Everyone to
his trade," I believe.
With these convictions
in my mind, I witnessed
the campaign of 1928. It
was apparent from the be-
ginning that there was no
real economic difference
between Smith and Hoo-
ver. Both were strong
conservatives. Hoover a
bit more liberal than
Smith.
Hence, with nothing to
divide them on grounds of
public policy, the religious
difference became predom-
inant.
Smith was also handi-
capped by Tammany and
the difficulty that people
beyond New York had in
seeing the greatness of the
man through his quite
original mannerisms.
There was also prohibi-
tion. To its everlasting
credit, the disciplined
Catholic clergy refused to
reply to the attacks upon
Smith's religious faith.
This time there is a
very, very distinct differ-
ence. Nixon stands be-
hind the record of the past
seven-plus years of the Ei-
senhower administration,
in which an attempt, how-
ever small, was made to
check centralized power
and to keep stable money.
Nixon would build upon
that, but in the spirit of
the same philosophy.
*
Behind the vague
phrases about the "New
Frontier," Kennedy stands
for a deep plunge into
welfarism, labor privilege,
and centralized federal
government, with the sure
end of either devastating
inflation or iron controls
and regimentation of the
economy.
This is the real choice
this year, and the sooner
we begin to consider it
and vote accordingly, the
better for the future of the
country.
The crowds that greeted
Nixon in the Deep South
were not there because of
religion or civil rights. On
the latter issue there is
no real choice. The crowds
were there because the
South is conservative. It
is an enlightened region
and it is not, as a whole,
dedicated to keeping a
Catholic out of the White
House.
