RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Nation Appears
in Excellent Shape
For the first time in a
number of years, this po-
litical commentator de-
cided to skip the two na-
tional conventions. Instead,
I decided to have a
good look at the nation
that the politicians want
to operate on.
I left New York by au-
tomobile on the day the
Democratic show ended
and traveled to Los An-
geles over what used to
be called the Lincoln
Highway. From Los An-
geles, which is just re-
covering from the dizzy-
ing visitation of two weeks
ago, I shall go to the
Northwest and back east.

There is good authority
for this manner of report-
ing on politics far from
the maddening throng.
Once upon a time, that
great maestro of the politi-
cal art, F.D.R., advised re-
porters to get out of Wash-
ington by means of a sec-
ondhand car and study the
way the real people lived.
That was good advice.
There is time for observa-
tion and much reflection
on such a trip. I made no
pretense of what is called
"pulse-taking" or inter-
viewing. There isn't time
for that.
Anyhow, the people from
ocean to ocean are too
busy working to accumu-
late the taxes which their
ministering angels in
Washington are planning
to levy.

So I have no polls to re-
port and no analysis of
how this country plans to
vote in November. I doubt
whether most people will
think about that until the
hot days are over.
It is well that I re-
mained in New York to
listen to what was said by
the Democrats in Los An-
geles, for I left with an
awesome dread of what I
was to see.
For we were told by
those Democratic orators
that this country is in a
dreadful state: starving
farmers, dilapidated
schools, decaying cities,
obsolete highways. In
short, what one Democrat-
ic adviser called "public
squalor."
I shall have more to re-
port on what I saw on this
trip, but I am able to as-
sure those who may be
alarmed that the only
thing they have to fear is
the decay of politicians.
The country is sound.
I offer only one example
now to prove that there
has been no neglect of the
public services employed
by all, the nation's high-
ways. There is smooth
roomy evidence of the bil-
lions that have been spent
in that sector of our public
services.
For a thousand miles
from New York there is
not a single stop except for
rest, gas and tolls. Then
for another thousand miles
there are great stretches of
newly completed high-
ways, with occasional
spots of construction.
Then, at the end of the
journey from Wyoming
through Utah, Nevada and
California, there is prob-
ably the finest strip of
modern roadway west of
the Mississippi.
★
As to the state of the
farmers, I shall have more
to say on another occasion.
But here I merely add
some incontrovertible evi-
dence of the falsity of the
political charge that dur-
ing the last few years the
federal government has
neglected its public serv-
ices to the nation.
Between fiscal years
1953 and 1961, federal ex-
penditures have increased
7%. The population will
have increased 13%. Fed-
eral spending for civilian
purposes, which means
public services to the na-
tion, was $14.5 billion in
1953. This fiscal year it
will be $34.1 billion, an in-
crease of 135%.
If there is, as the ora-
tors say, public squalor,
there must have been
dreadful waste by Con-
gress. Also, if this be pub-
lic squalor, it must have
been something frightful
when 20 years of Demo-
cratic supremacy came to
an end seven and one-half
years ago.
