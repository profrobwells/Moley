:
The Public Doesn't
Owe Them a Living
Two or three years ago
I wrote a piece protesting
against the policy of au-
tomobile manufacturers
which, by annual changes
in styling, tried to induce
customers to buy new cars
every two or three years.
I brought upon myself
a shower of criticism from
economists and financial
writers. They said I failed
to understand the Ameri-
can economy, which by
great waste stimulated
great production and a
higher national product.
What, they said, would
happen to the steel peo-
ple if everybody insisted
upon driving an automo-
bile five or six years?

Indeed, I once heard the
head of one of the great
automobile companies tell
an audience that if every-
body decided to keep his
automobile more than two
years his company would
have to go out of business.
The implication in his
remark was that somehow
the American public owed
his company a living. My
thought, as he said what
he did, was that he would
learn that when it came
to a choice of values the
American people would
not care a hoot whether
his company lived or not.
But now there is au-
thority for my complaint
by the head of a company
which has certainly caught
public favor and has forced
recognition and imitation
by the monster corpora-
tions with which it com-
petes.

George Romney of
American Motors said not
long ago that it is time
for American automobile
companies to have more
respect for their custom-
ers and to allow them to
make their own decisions.
He said that so far as
his company's Rambler is
concerned it would be
changed only when there
was a real, practical, and
mechanical need for a
change. He declared in
effect that the "style"
racket has begun to pall
upon the buying public.
The statistics show that
his car and foreign cars
have found favor with the
public.
The common sense of it
is that if television sets, re-
frigerators, shoes, and other
consumer items are sup-
posed to be used by the
original buyers until they
are worn out it is pretty
silly after two years to have
the family believe it needs
a new automobile.
An automobile in its es-
sential parts is a piece of
mechanism, just like a type-
writer or a phonograph.
With care, it should last
several years.
Perhaps the pronounced
changes in styling are
aimed at the human in-
stinct to "keep up with the
Joneses." But when the
Joneses decide to use their
common sense the compe-
tition ends. And there is
every evidence that it is
ending. Witness the cars
parked at any country club.

After trying in every con-
ceivable way to make an
automobile look like some-
thing it is not-an airplane,
a boat, and what not-even
the big companies are re-
turning to more functional
lines which cannot change
from year to year.
It did not require a su-
per-planner to decide that
in Washington. The com-
mon sense of the customers
determined it.
So far as personal pres-
tige is concerned, it would
seem that there is real dis-
tinction in the way one
maintains what he has, be
it his home, his farm, his
garments, or his automo-
bile. With proper care, an
automobile loses no luster
in five or more years.
Nobody except the vain
and shallow can believe
that the size and expensive-
ness of a car add stature. It
is common knowledge that
many people who are driv-
ing the plush makes have
mortgaged their homes, if
they have homes, to buy
the cars.

So far as the industries
are concerned the indus-
tries which profited by the
styling craze-they have no
right to be supported on an
unsound marketing prin-
ciple. And the sooner they
adjust themselves to the
change in public choices
the better.
