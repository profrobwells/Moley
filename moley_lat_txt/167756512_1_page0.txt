CRITICS MUST CONSIDER FACTS
Richard Nixon Can't Be Blamed
for Failures of the Campaign
Vice President Nixon
emerges from an incredi-
ble ordeal of campaigning
only to face, for a long
time to come, criticism for
what he should or should
not have done to tip this
election in his favor.
"Liberals" in his party
will say he was too con-
servative, and conserva-
tives will say he failed to
support their position
with more vigor.

The host of amateur
tacticians, who come out
from their concern be-
tween elections with
everything but politics,
will say that this or that
decided the result. Much
of this criticism is about
as worthy of comment as
the wild guesses of
prophets before the elec-
tion who went so wrong
on what so many states
would do in the final vot-
ing day.
While every American
has a constitutional right
to express his opinions on
every subject, just as
every cash customer at a
ball game takes over the
manager's job, it will be
well to bear in mind some
of the problems which
faced the Vice President
in this campaign.
Some compromise is es-
sential in every campaign.
To be in politics at all,
especially to run for of-
fice, involves the art of
compromise in ways and
means to reach a common
objective with principles
untarnished. But too often
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
we are likely to confuse
means and ends and thus
reach conclusions inimical
to a candidate.
Before we condemn
Nixon and Nixon alone for
the loss of this election,
let us consider the prob-
lems he faced. His party
was as widely divided in
philosophy as New York
is removed from Arizona.
This has plagued the Re-
publicans for a genera-
tion.
At the Chicago conven-
tion, Nixon succeeded in
creating the best show of
party unity which we have
had since 1928. But the in-
fection was still there. Only
the fine common sense of
Sen. Barry Goldwater held
things together. Gov.
Rockefeller made only a
token campaign.

Nixon had the disadvan-
tage of defending an ad-
ministration in which the
major decisions had not
been his, although his
part in them was made
clear by the President. In
many instances he was un-
able to answer the Ken-
nedy charges against the
Eisenhower policies be-
cause that would have of-
fended the President.
In the Castro case, for
instance, Nixon could not
answer Kennedy's charge
that the two ambassadors,
Gardner and Smith, had
warned the State Depart-
ment about the danger of
Castro because that would
have revealed that the
State Department has not
been cleared of the appeas-
ers entrenched in the low-
er ranks. Ambassador
Gardner could not even
get through the bureau-
crats to see Secretary Dul-
les and the President with
his warning.
Then there was the in-
satiable curiosity of the
public to see and hear the
candidates, thus making
the geographical range of
campaigning so broad that
no real consideration of
issues could be gotten over
to the country.

It was a mistake, per-
haps, to debate at all. But
the wretched job of pres-
entation destroyed any
chance of an adequate dis-
cussion of the issues.
Finally, the organization
of the Republican Party
was so weak in many
states that the Nixon-
Lodge organization had to
carry the whole load. What
good organization could
have done in many of
those states is shown by
what happened in Ohio,
where state chairman Ray
Bliss won despite an enor-
mous labor union organi-
zation in the industrial
counties.
The immense popular
vote for Nixon now gives
him a position of leader-
ship in which he can turn
to the reorganization of his
party for capturing Con-
gress in 1962 and the Pres-
idency in 1964.
