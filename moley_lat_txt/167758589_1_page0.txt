RIGHT AGAINST RIGHT
Pros and Cons in New Orleans:
There Can Be No Easy Solution
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last week this writer
was in New Orleans dur-
ing the disturbances there
over the enforcement of
the orders of the federal
court requiring token inte-
gration in the schools.
Looking back at the rela-
tive quiet, business-as-usu-
al atmosphere which pre-
vailed over that busy city,
it seems to me that the
press, radio and television
have overplayed the com-
paratively small disorders.
What one witnessed was
a small corner of a strug-
gle which disturbs a large
section of the nation, be-
tween two concepts of our
constitutional order. Both
sides are convinced of the
rightness of their interpre-
tation of what this Repub-
lic means. It is right
against right.
★
And as in all cases when
right is arrayed against
right, feelings are in-
flamed and the ultimate de-
cisions of wise statesmen
are difficult.
For the South rests its
case upon the basic con-
ditions under which this
nation was created—con-
ditions which had to be
met if there was to be a
nation at all. One of those
basic conditions was that
the states of the nation
reserved for themselves all
authority except what was
specifically assigned by
the Constitution to the
federal government.
There was nothing in
those assigned powers
about federal control or
administration of tax-sup-
ported schools. The 14th
Amendment became a part
of the Constitution under
conditions which many
wise and orderly people
believe to have been at
variance with the plan for
amendments which pre-
ceded it.
Those wise and orderly
people, many of whom are
just as learned in the law
as the members of the
United States Supreme
Court, believe that the
court's decision in 1954
was an unwarranted inter-
pretation of the terms of
the 14th Amendment.
Others believe that the
court possesses the author-
ity to say what the Con-
stitution means but that
the opinion written by
Chief Justice Warren con-
tained specious and un-
warranted reasons for the
court's decision.
Southern states, through
their elected leaders, base
their case upon those con-
tentions, plus tradition
and the actual facts which
prevail in the relation-
ships between the races.
This, they assert, is the
right.
★
Those who press for in-
tegration assert that their
right rests upon the law
of the land as decreed by
the authority of the courts.
The determination of
which right should have
precedence is a matter for
statesmanship which, it is
hoped, will be wise and
restrained.
But the situation which
confronted Mayor deLes-
seps S. Morrison and the
city of New Orleans was
not a right against a right.
It was the right which no
one disputes—that there is
no moral, legal or consti-
tutional basis for forcible
resistance to the lawful
operations of government.
To acquiesce to such
force would be to support
revolution. And revolu-
tion is the negation of all
law and order. It is wrong
on all counts. Thus the
mayor and the city over
which he presides had no
problem of deciding be-
tween two rights. Their
problem was the simple
one of sustaining right
against wrong.
★
At a meeting on Nov. 17,
the leading civic and busi-
ness leaders of the city,
whose efforts have con-
tributed to the great prog-
ress that the New Orleans
region has enjoyed in the
last few years, by a strong
resolution sustained the
actions of the mayor and
the police in restraining
the mob violence which at-
tended the token integra-
tion. That violence was ac-
tually encouraged by the
emotion-packed talk and
actions of the Legislature
in Baton Rouge.
The firm resistance, nay,
suppression of mob vio-
lence by the mayor and po-
lice of New Orleans, should
be understood by the
North and by all who are
far removed from the
scene, as well as the con-
ditions which must be
contended with in en-
forced integration in the
South.
All this deserves to be
explained and commended
by law-abiding people ev-
erywhere to a far greater
degree than it has been in
the last two weeks.
