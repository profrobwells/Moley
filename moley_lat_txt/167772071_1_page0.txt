Lippmann on Kennedy and Nixon;
Moley on Lippmann as a Prophet
BY WALTER LIPPMANN
It is plain enough that the Democrats
would be better off if there had been
no August session of Congress. Sen.
Johnson and Speaker Rayburn, who en-
gineered it, made a miscalculation. They
supposed that the session would help
Johnson to win the Presidential nomi-
nation and then to shine in August as
the great legislative operator.
In fact, with President Eisenhower in
the White House, the odds were over-
whelmingly against any Democratic suc-
cess. For while the Demo-
cratic majority can say no
to the President, and it
did, a Republican Presi-
dent can say no to a Demo-
cratic majority, and he did.
In our congressional
system positive political
achievement in a very
short session against the
will of the President is
impossible.
Though Kennedy and
Johnson have come out
of the session with a rec-
ord of frustration, Nixon
has come out with the
prospect that, if elected,
he will be a deeply frus-
trated President.
Kennedy was not able
to get his proposals en-
acted. But he came very
near to doing that and
the vote showed clearly
that if elected it is vir-
tually certain that he
could get his proposals
enacted.
*
Nixon, on the other
hand, comes out of the
session with the demon-
stration that there is a
strong and angry majority
against him in Congress.
Kennedy, as a candidate, is
unable to lead the Con-
gress. But unless there is
some kind of Republican
landslide in November,
Nixon as President will
have a perpetual struggle
with Congress.
The August maneuvers
have revealed something
of the general shape of the
campaign. More than most
campaigns it will be con-
ducted at two levels, one
avowed by the candidates
and the other disavowed
but tolerated and counted
upon.
The main, but by no
means the only, item in
the subterranean cam-
paign will be Kennedy's
religion, an issue which
cuts unpredictably both
ways.
In the open campaign,
Nixon's problem is, of
course, how to get full val-
ue out of Eisenhower's
support without identify-
ing himself with the Ei-
senhower record.
Nixon has worked out a
formula to solve this prob-
lem. It is to run not on the
record itself but on his
own personal experience in
having been for seven
years a leading insider in
the government. Thus he
hopes to avoid a defense of
the record while building
up his reputation as a man
of unusual, indeed unique,
experience.
*
His divorcement from
the Eisenhower record is
following two lines. One is
to oppose openly the most
politically vulnerable parts
of the record, the farm
problem at home and the
risks taken by Eisenhower
with the defense establish-
ment.
Thus Nixon opposes
Benson openly and em-
braces Rockefeller, despite
the fact that Benson is a
favorite of the President
and Rockefeller is no fa-
vorite of the President.
The other line of di-
vorcement from the Eisen-
hower record is to be suf-
ficiently in favor of virtual-
ly everything in the Demo-
cratic platform to blur the
issues which really do exist
between the Democrats

When an editor or commentator has
been widely read for a period of nearly
half a century, has advised Presidents
and statesmen, has been read with
something approaching reverence by
countless thousands and has passed
through notable eras in American po-
litical life, he becomes a substantial na-
tional figure.
Such a luminous figure is Walter
Lippmann, the constant companion of
his countrymen at their breakfast ta-
bles. He was reputed to
have assisted Woodrow
Wilson in writing the
Fourteen Points, he col-
laborated with Col. House
in preparing for the peace
conference after the armi-
stice in 1918, and, after
peace was concluded, dis-
agreed with the Versailles
Treaty in a notable docu-
ment.
He reached a high pin-
nacle in journalism as edi-
tor of the New York
World prior to its demise.
While Henry Stimson was
secretary of state there
was deposited in his of-
fice a ready-reference file
of the Lippmann columns,
no doubt to guide the sec-
retary in his conduct of
foreign affairs.
When a man reaches
such eminence, he passes
beyond the ranks of those
of us who are just daily or
weekly writers for the
press. But in that trans-
formation he loses the im-
munity generally accord-
ed within that fraternity.
In short, he can be sub-
jected to the criticism of
commentators, just as are
statesmen such as the
President, the candidates
for his office. Dag Ham-
marskjold, Nehru and
Lumumba.
*
The point I want to make
is that Mr. Lippmann in his
later years has developed
quite irrational antipathies.
Notable are his mental con-
tortions designed to dis-
credit Eisenhower and Nix-
on and the administration
of which they have been a
part.
The most recent is an
article which derives from
the debacle which has re-
sulted from the Johnson-
Kennedy-Rayburn effort to
hold an August session of
Congress as part of their
political campaign.
Lippmann views the fail-
ure of the Johnson-Ken-
nedy leadership to get an
overwhelming Democratic
Congress to enact its pro-
gram as an indication that
Kennedy, rather than Nix-
on, would get on better
with Congress.
Most people have noted
that if Sen. Kennedy can-
not manage his own party
on the eve of an election,
he might have a great deal
more trouble managing
things if he were elected.
Last summer Lippmann
asserted that Nixon's visit
to Poland would be a great
mistake. The fact was that
when the Kremlin told Nix-
on he could not return
through Siberia to the
United States, Nixon
clearly outmaneuvered the
Kremlin by turning west-
ward to Poland, where he
had a hero's reception.
*
More important is the
Lippmann acceptance,
hook, line and sinker, of the
Galbraith-Kennedy thesis
that the Eisenhower admin-
istration has neglected "the
public sector of the econ-
omy" and has permitted a
withering away of public
services and human wel-
fare.
It is argued not by spe-
cific figures but by bold
assertions of generalities.
After all, when a man be-
comes an oracle he need
not bother about being a
statistician.
But the facts are that
while the population in the
Eisenhower years 1953-
1961 has increased 13%
and the gross national
product 47%, the expendi-
tures on "the public sector"
have increased 135%.
Expenditures on private
consumption in that time
have increased one-half
while federal spending for
civilian purposes has gone
up almost two and a half
times in eight years.
Mr. Lippmann would do
better to do a bit of his own
research rather than ac-
cepting uncritically what is
being said by economists in
politics and by politicians
talking economics.
and the Eisenhower ad-
ministration. This is the
tactic of fudging issues.
On popular welfare
measures, such as medical
care and education, Nixon
does not, as would Sen.
Goldwater, oppose Kenne-
dy. He joins Kennedy just
enough not to cause an ex-
plosion of wrath in the
White House.
Kennedy's problem is, of
course, how to get the
whole Democratic vote,
which is numerically a
large majority. For this he
has, of course, to override
the religious issue. He al-
so has to create an eager
Democratic organization
in the states which will
bring out the Democratic
voters. These are his tasks
at the surface and below.
*
Above ground, where he
is appealing to the great
mass of the electorate, he
has devoted his first atten-
tion, though not the whole
of it, to the large bloc
which constitutes the Dem-
ocratic majority: to the tra-
ditional southern demo-
cratic voters, the farmers,
organized labor, the egg-
heads, the veterans, the
Negroes, the new immi-
grant minorities, the Jews,
and the liberal Protestants.
He has been telling them
what they want to hear.
There are reasons for
saying that something else
is needed. In congression-
al elections the Democratic
majority is the sum of its
parts. But in a Presiden-
tial election, the whole is
something above and great-
er than its parts.
This means that Ken-
nedy cannot assemble a
majority, bloc by bloc. He
must arouse and fuse a
majority out of a heteroge-
neous mass.
To do this, that is, to
make a national appeal,
Kennedy has chosen for
his theme the need to ar-
rest and reverse the de-
cline of American power
and influence in the con-
test with the Communist
world. This is indeed the
paramount issue facing
the country, and it is also
an issue on which the
Eisenhower administra-
tion is deeply vulnerable.
*
But it will not be
enough, I believe, to keep
telling the country that it
must arm more efficiently,
though that is essential.
It will be necessary also
to awaken the country to
realize that national pow-
er is more than arms.
Beyond that, what the
country needs and will
surely respond to is a con-
viction that, as Churchill
once said, "we arm to par-
ley," that the purpose of
building up our power is
not to sit sullenly trading
insults but to overcome
the fiasco of last May, and
to bring the Soviet Union
back to the conference
room.
Politically, this looks
like a hot potato. But, as
President Eisenhower was
proving until the May dis-
aster, there is political
magic in the man who in
a posture of strength is
able to build a bridge
across the abyss.
