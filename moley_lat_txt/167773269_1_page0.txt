Once upon a time, when
I had only 21 summers be-
hind me, I was "superin-
tendent" of a village
school. That distinguished
title on my stationery
meant that I was supreme
over three elementary
teachers and that I taught
all the classes in the 9th
and 10th grades myself.
There was no over-
crowding and, while we
had no gymnasium, there
were ample grounds for
outdoor exercise, even in
winter. We had a bit of
aid from the state of Ohio,
but mostly the budget was
balanced by the taxpay-
ers, who elected a school
board and kept an eye on
the school.
One day the teacher of
the first three grades told
me about a little girl in
her room whose deficient
eyesight had been "rem-
edied" by the widowed fa-
ther. He made her wear
g'asses left behind by her
deceased mother. I told
the teacher to send the
girl home to stay until the
father provided suitable
glasses.
The irate father ap-
pealed to the school board,
and 1 appeared to defend
my action. He did not
claim inability to provide
suitable glasses. He
claimed that I was "arbi-
trary."
After a hearing which
many villagers attended,
the school board told the
father to get suitable
glasses or they would take
legal action against him.
He did, and the girl re-
sumed her education.
No one dreamed that
the little girl's eyes were
a responsibility of the fed-
eral government. Uncle
Sam was busy running the
post office and installing
rural free delivery.
Today, in 1961, as I was
reading the message of
the President of the Unit-
ed States, his phraseology
brought back the memory
of those dear old pastoral
days:
"Our progress as a na-
tion can be no swifter
than our progress in edu-
cation... the human mind
is our fundamental re-
source ... invest in hu-
man beings... a success-
ful educational system re-
quires proper balance ...
this investment will pay
rich dividends in the years
ahead..." etc.
The President awakens
dreams of those good years
before we had so many
people analyzing our
problems. Those days
when the country "just
growed," without a lot of
economists figuring things
in percentages, and when
we little cared whether
Russia was growing or not.
What is really hokum is
not the Chief Executive's
substitution of platitudes
for argument, but his
arithmetic. He says we
shall need 600,000 class-
rooms in the next 10 years.
But the lowly school
boards and states have,
according to Secretary
Ribicoff's office of educa-
tion, built new classrooms
over the past five years at
the rate of 70,000 a year.
Nobody, apparently,
told the President about
those figures. He says that
there are 90,000 teachers
who are still short of cer-
tification. That is only 6%
of the teaching force.
But when the standards
for certification were low-
er than now, a few years
ago, 10% of teachers were
short of certification.
The arithmetic fails to
justify spending about
$2Â½ billion of federal
money. But let us credit
the President with having
established the ringing
truth that education is a
good thing.
