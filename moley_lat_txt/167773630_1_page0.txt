The Republicans Must Turn South
for Help in Regaining Presidency
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
These were the heart-
chilling months, a century
ago, when the shadow of
interstate war crept over
the land.
That tragedy might have
been prevented. Lincoln
did not want war. His Re-
publican Party was not
committed to abolition.
The South had not been
committed to secession—
at least before the previ-
ous election.
*
In the election in which
Lincoln was chosen, Bell,
the candidate of the Con-
stitutional Union Party,
had carried Georgia and
Louisiana and the states
of the Upper South. Ste-
phen A. Douglas, also a
candidate, reported that in
his travels in the South he
found little sentiment for
secession.
Compromises like that
proposed by Sen. Critten-
den might well have pre-
vented conflict until the
inevitable economic proc-
esses—so well described
in Halper’s “Impending
Crisis”—had wiped out
slavery.
But the deadly seeds
sowed by a handful of fa-
natics in the North and
in the South had taken
roots, and the poisonous
fruits were ripe. When
war came, millions of
American men and boys
responded, and their blood
flowed through four ter-
rible years.
*
Then the victorious Re-
publican Party fell into
the hands of fanatical
statesmen and adventur-
ers, and more than 10
years of terror resulted.
That is a stain which Re-
publicans should now try
to erase.
But again, at the open-
ing of Congress, we wit-
ness the tiresome re-en-
actment of the argument
for changes in the rules.
Republicans are joined
now by illiberal “liberal”
Democrats to parade the
shell of an issue from
which all living parts
have vanished. In the Sen-
ate exponents of simple
majority rule battle with
those who seek to main-
tain the constitutional
principle of minority
rights.
The present hullabaloo
will probably end as al-
ways, since the majority
have enough sense be-
neath their hypocrisy to
realize that when they are
in a minority they want
the same right to check
precipitate action as the
senators from the South
do.
The South could not
split the Union, but it was
able in self-defense to de-
stroy the Republican Par-
ty as a national organiza-
tion. The Negroes around
whom the hurricane
swirled no longer regard
the Republican Party and
Abraham Lincoln as their
liberators. They have
found Democratic emanci-
pators. And their vote in
1960 frustrated the oppor-
tunity of the Republican
Party to retain the Presi-
dency.
★
Republicans of national
stature who campaigned in
the South in the 1960 cam-
paign say now that the
great vote for Nixon was
not based upon religion
and certainly not on what
the Republicans have done
for civil rights.
It was given to Nixon-
Lodge because a new gen-
eration in the South is
seeking an alternative to
the Democratic Party dom-
inated by radicals and “lib-
erals.” To attain the Pres-
idency again, the Republi-
can Party needs not so
much votes as states. And
those states are in the
South, if the GOP has
enough sense to turn from
its sorry past.
