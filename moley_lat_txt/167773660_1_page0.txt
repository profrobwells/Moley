"If you can't win under
the rules, change the
rules." This seems to be
the theme of liberals who
find themselves frustrated
at the end of the bobtailed
session of Congress.
One report is that Sen.
Kennedy "is expected to
throw his weight behind"
a drive to curb the power
of the oHuse Rules Com-
mittee. This is not likely,
because the senator has
been in Congress long
enough to know that of all
people who might have the
least influence over the
rules of the House of Rep-
resentatitves a senator is
foremost.
To a member of the
House who has been there
a long time, the Senate is
a thing apart. Members
guard their prerogatives
fiercely from any influence
from the Senate. And to a
veteran of either party in
the House, John F. Ken-
nedy is just another sen-
ator.
Speaker Rayburn is
quoted as saying. "I'll nev-
er let the Rules Committee
get away from my control
again." I doubt the au-
thenticity of that state-
ment. Two years before
Rayburn was elected to the
House in 1912, a famous
revolt took place which de-
termined once and for all
that the speaker should
not control the Rules Com-
mittee,
It was really the first
victory of the liberals of
that time, who then called
themselves Progressives.
They carried through in
1910 a vote which took
from the speaker the
authority to appoint the
Rules Committee and took
the speaker off the com-
mittee the object of their
drive being to cut down the
power of Speaker Joe Can-
non.
An attempt has already
been made in the House to
change the rules so that
the Rules Committee may
be made more easily ame-
nable to the majority par-
ty. This proposal is backed
by Reps. Roosevelt,
Thompson (N.J.), Holified,
Porter, Stagers, Quigley,
Flynn, and Wolf. Perhaps
these members are too
young to know it, but they
are proposing almost ex-
actly what their liberal
predecessors hailed as a
great victory in 1910 when
by resolution the took the
speaker off the Rules Com-
mittee.
In the convention which
nominated Kennedy, the
platform adopted began
with Jefferson's slogan
when he first ran for Pres-
ident in 1796, "The Rights
of Man."
But Jefferson had some-
thing to say also about the
rights of a minority. In his
"Manual of Parliamentary
Practice," which is still an
authority in Congress, he
said, "The only weapons
by which a minority can
defend itself against . . .
those in power are the
forms and rules of proceed-
ing which have been
adopted as they were found
necessary and are become
the law of the House, by a
strict adherence to which
the weaker party can only
be protected from . . .
wantonness of power" (in)
"large and successful ma-
jorities."
As it stands, the Rules
Committee is not absolute.
As Howard Smith said in
answer to the proposals of
his enemies, there are
three ways by which the
decisions of the Rules Com-
mittee may be overridden.
One is a two-thirds vote to
suspend the rules, another
is when a majority of the
members sign a petition to
discharge any committee
from its consideration of a
bill, and another is when
on Wednesday of every
week a bill may be brought
up for consideration from
the committee which is
hoiding it.
What restrains a majori-
ty from tyranny is the
realization that only by a
firm adherence to rules and
good order can any mem-
ber or any party be safe
from tyranny. For under
our Constitution, a majority
does not rule; it governs.
And decisions are made by
all members of the parlia-
mentary body, including
the minority. Anything else
would be in violation of
order, reason, and fair play.
