"Where MacGregor sits
is the head of the table."
is an old maxim which has
pertinence in the present
flurry between the Pres-
ident, Gov. Rockefeller and
Sen, Goldwater.
Under our American
system of party responsi-
bility, that individual
emerges as the recognized
leader who represents the
degree of intelligence, ca-
pacity to weld together
conflicting elements, a n d
popular attractiveness to
be accepted by those who,
over the nation, hold of-
ficial party offices.
These are not just the
members of Congress, or
the state chairmen, or the
big contributors, or those
editors and others who
wield public opinion.
Nor is the defeated
Presidential candidate, of-
ten called the "titular"
leader, always the head of
the party. More often in
our system there is no
real leader. Leadership is
carned, not conferred by
anyone.
Among the many fea-
tures which distinguish
the British system of gov-
ernment from ours is the
status of party leadership.
The parliamentary leader
is elected by the members
of the party in the House
of Commons.
Leadership outside the
parliamentary party dif-
fers somewhat in the two
major parties. In the Con-
servative Party there is, in
addition to the parliamen-
tary party, a National Un-
ion. This has a chairman
whose power and respon-
sibility are mostly nomi-
nal.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The Labor Party, like
the Conservative, has a
leader of its parliamentary
party elected by its m.p.s.;
But Labor outside Parlia-
ment has at its head a Na-
tional Executive Commit-
tee.
For many reasons, in
Britain the dominating in-
fluence in each party is
the parliamentary group
with its leader. This is be-
cause the eves of the na-
tion are fixed upon what
is going on in Parliament.

Without accepting the
thesis that the British
have a better system of
government than ours,
there is no question but
that in this practice their
parties have the great ad-
vantage over ours. Per-
haps that is why most of
the countries that have as-
sumed nationhood since
1776 have followed the
British rather than the
American system. Only in
Latin America has our ex-
ample been followed, and
there the Presidents have
generally become dicta-
tors.
Because we are a very
large country and because
our republic is a confed-
cration of states, there is
always more or less dis-
pute about who is the lead-
er of the party which does
not have the Presidency.
Hoover, Landon, Willkie
and Dewey, after their de-
feats for the Presidency,
were never generally re-
garded as party leaders.
The struggle for the Presi-
dential nomination pro-
duces a sort of pro tem
leader. If he is elected
President, he can lead. If
defeated, he usually does
not.
But in the case of Vice
President Nixon we have
an unusual situation. Not
only did he receive more
votes than any Republi-
can ever received before
with the exception of Ei-
senhower in 1956, but, if
the charges of Republicans
are true, he should now
be the President-elect.
He has shown a greater
capacity than any Repub-
lican in our time to bring
harmony to his party. But,
most important, the reluc-
tance of Rockefeller and
Goldwater to accept his
leadership since the elec-
tion and their own ambi-
tions for the future make
Nixon the natural choice
of most members of the
party who are not so con-
servative as Goldwater
and not so radical as
Rockefeller.

Rockefeller asks for
"collective" leadership.
Rather, he should recog-
nize something more ap-
propriately called "cohe-
sive" leadership.
That means that the
force of two opposing ex-
tremities creates in be-
tween a hard majority
which is sick of conten-
tions and which chooses a
spokesman who stands
somewhere between.
If Nixon chooses, and if
he will put his energies
into the job, he will pre-
vail and be, so far as the
American system permits,
the foremost Republican in
the nation and the party's
authentic leader.
