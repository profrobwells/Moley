Schoolmaster's Dream
of Aid to Education
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The plan for federal aid
to schools submitted to
the President-elect by a
"task force" headed by Dr.
Frederick Hovde is really
a schoolmaster's dream. It
is a bundle of wants from
school and college admin-
istrators for almost every
purpose for which there is
need for money.
It embodies the idea,
current among schoolmen
and their pressure groups,
that there is nothing
wrong with education that
more money won't cure.
It should be noted that
this is not a demand from
the many school boards
over the country, which
have had the painful re-
sponsibility for looking
after the education of their
constituents' children. It
comes from the profession-
als hired by boards and
trustees to operate the
schools.

I am concerned here
only with that part of the
Hovde pork-barrel which
has to do with the public
schools. That part of the
program needs the most
careful examination by
Congress and the nation's
taxpayers, because it pro-
poses an entirely new de-
parture in the expansion
of the federal power which
has been rejected by many
Congresses in the past.
The total sum is stag-
gering. So much so that
even the man who asked
for the report, President-
elect Kennedy, and his
designee for the Depart-
ment of Health, Education
and Welfare greeted it
with raised eyebrows.
The major objections to
this plan and to federal aid
for the public schools gen-
erally are two. Such aid
has not proved to be and
is not now necessary.

President Eisenhower
has at various times pro-
posed aid for school con-
struction. His figures of
construction shortages
have been periodically
provided for him by the
bureaucracy of the Office
of Education, which has
been altogether too great-
ly under the influence of
the National Education
Assn. and other pressure
groups.
The figure of school
classroom shortages pro-
jected five years ago for
1960 has more than been
met without federal aid.
And the figures of class-
room shortages submitted
from time to time by the
Eisenhower administra-
tion have over and over
been proved to be in er-
ror.
According to figures on
school costs given by vari-
ous expert groups and in-
dividuals, our public
schools cost about $14 bil-
lion in 1960. Most of those
estimates were about $12
billion in 1958. In the years
ahead to 1969-70, the esti-
mated need will be for
about $1 billion more per
year.
These figures are care-
fully recorded with an
abundance of supporting
data in a very important
new book, "Taxes for the
Schools," by Roger Free-
man, who two years ago
published another book,
"School Needs in the
Decade Ahead."
At that time, his power-
fully stated case against
federal aid earned him
violent attacks from the
NEA, but in the ensuing
controversy Freeman sus-
tained his case. His new
book will no doubt precipi-
tate another debate.
If we consider that the
cost of public education
will rise to $24 billion by
1970, the amount proposed
by Hovde, $1.46 billion an-
nually, while a consider-
able burden on the federal
budget, would only be a
small amount in school
support.
Thus, what is called fed-
eral aid is really only a
token. But it is what the
school administrators have
always wanted—a foot in
the door to ultimate con-
trol. That, therefore, is the
issue before Congress and
the people of the country.
Do they want education to
be controlled by the pro-
fessional educators, or by
the parents of the children
who are to be educated?
