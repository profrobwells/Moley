Nixon's Accord With Rockefeller
Is a Reaffirmation of His Policies

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

As we look back at the
recent Chicago convention,
two unusual features stand
out as particularly important.

The President made
what was no doubt the finest
speech of his career. His
party now has at least one
half of its ammunition for
the campaign—a text for
the defense of the Republican
administration's accomplishments
in its two terms in the White
House.

The other half must be
supplied by the candidate,
Vice President Nixon, when
he elaborates the promises
for the future.

All the rest of the convention
proceedings were foreordained
and unexciting, with the
exception of Sen. Goldwater's
fine exposition of the views
of the conservatives in the
GOP.

The platform is excessively
long. Few will ever read it,
and it will be soon forgotten.

The Vice President's bold
stroke in creating an accord
with Gov. Rockefeller was
made because of the demands
of political expediency. It
was Nixon's conviction that
the nomination of Sen. Johnson
for Vice President on the
Democratic ticket made the
carrying of a sizable number
of Southern states less likely.
Therefore, as a candidate he
would have to intensify his
effort to win Northern industrial
states.

He no doubt realized that
Rockefeller's help in New
York would not assure him
the electoral votes of that
state. But an unhappy and
rebellious Rockefeller would
make it much more difficult
for any Republican to carry
New York and the Northeast.

A careful examination of
the terms of the Nixon-Rockefeller
agreement fails to show that
Nixon was persuaded to go
"liberal." The statement, so
far as it departed from the
more conservative opinions
in the Republican Party is
concerned, was merely a reaffirmation
of the basic convictions held
by the Vice President long
before the convention. It
was Rockefeller who gave up
most of his pre-convention
platform.

The statement clearly indicates
that Rockefeller's widely advertised
claim that he and Nixon were
in fundamental disagreement
was exaggerated. Consider what
they said about four of the alleged
earlier points of disagreement:

Nixon has always by conviction
been for strong civil rights
legislation and action by the
federal government. I happen
to be among those who believe
it is wrong to attempt by federal
action to force a mingling of
the races faster than the reasonable
and knowledgeable people in
the South deem wise.

So far as national defense is
concerned, Rockefeller dropped
his demand for a rise in expenditures
and in the statement merely
underlined steps which the Eisenhower
administration is taking in any
event.

On the subject of national growth
and the methods to be employed
to achieve it, the statement is about
the same as Nixon has been suggesting
for a considerable time.

The most doubtful item is on
agriculture. Here they say they
favor at least doubling the conservation
reserve. If this means doubling the
soil bank—a step which Nixon has
been considering for a long time—it
means throwing twice as much money
as before into an experiment which
has been a complete failure.

This may get some farmers' votes,
but it is going to frighten everyone
who fears greater spending and inflation.
The solution of the farm problem
will require something more imaginative
than much more of the same.

It is unfortunate for conservatives
everywhere that they have in Sen.
Goldwater the most attractive, intelligent,
and articulate spokesman for sound
government in many years. He will
be a powerful influence in Congress
and the country to see that the more
extravagant promises of the platform
and the candidates are not enacted
into the law of the land.
