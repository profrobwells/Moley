RAYMOND MOLEY:
Texas Needs Change
in Election System
No one will quarrel with
the pride which the peo-
ple of Texas have in their
remarkable state. Its phe-
nomenal progress in indus-
try, trade, education and
culture can be acknowl-
edged. It is a power in
the nation and the world.
But this election has re-
vealed some grim facts
about its electoral system,
the reform of which should
be its next order of busi-
ness. Some of these perti-
nent facts have been
brought out by the Hous-
ton Chronicle since the
election.
In 236 of the 254 coun-
ties in Texas, paper ballots
are used. In this election
there were listed on the
ballots the names of four
parties, in this order: Con-
stitution, Republican, Pro-
hibition, and Democratic.
Under the name of each
party, the names of the
various candidates were
printed.
The voter was expected
to cross out all the names
of candidates he did not
want to vote for. And he
was supposed to go
through the list of candi-
dates in order, leaving
only those whom he pre-
ferred.

The opportunity that
this absurd requirement
would offer for mistakes
by careless or ignorant
voters is obvious. Obvious,
too, is the wide opportuni-
ty for election officials to
throw out ballots, either
because the election offi-
cials were deliberately in-
tent upon favoring one or
the other candidate or be-
cause of slovenly haste in
getting the job done and
the small fee earned.
In order to prevent mis-
takes and fraud, the state
law requires that all bal-
lots mutilated or defaced
or on which no determina-
tion of the intention of the
voter could be made—in
short, all ballots not count-
ed—should be put in a
separate ballot box, No. 4.
The law further re-
quires that the presiding
judge at the polling place
should write and sign a
statement containing the
number of ballot papers he
had at the beginning of the
voting, the number which
were not used, and the
number not counted be-
cause of defacement or im-
proper marking and place
such statement in the box.
Then the box should be
sealed and delivered to the
county clerk.
The law then requires
that the "county commis-
sioners court" should open
the boxes and check the
contents.
In the check of 11 coun-
ties, the Houston Chron-
icle found that some of the
county clerks had no No. 4
ballot boxes, and some
said that they did not
know of any such require-
ment for such ballot box.
Clearly, the law had
been generally disregard-
ed. This meant that in the
counties checked by the
Chronicle, thousands of
ballots were not account-
ed for. Apparently, the
"commissioners courts" in
the counties never both-
ered to check the results
unless there was a demand
for a recount.

The law further pro-
vides that a canvassing
board consisting of the
governor, the secretary of
state, and the attorney
general shall be the court
of appeal in contested
elections. In this case, the
Republican state chair-
man went before the state
canvassing board and
asked for an investigation.
His appeal was rejected.
At the moment, it is in-
tended to appeal to the
federal courts.
An estimate made by
responsible Texans is that
from 100,000 to 150,000
ballots were actually cast
which have not been ac-
counted for. Since Ken-
nedy carried the state by
less than 50,000, these
lost, strayed, and forgot-
ten ballots may have
changed the result.
This instance of the
complication of the ballot,
the method of marking it,
the complicated require-
ments of the law, and the
ignorance of the officials
with the responsibility of
counting and checking
votes was probably not
present in a majority of
states.
But evidence is mount-
ing that not only in Texas
but in many other states
there is need to bring
election machinery into
some degree of approxi-
mation with other fea-
tures of modern life. This
instance suggests some-
thing almost as primitive
as Dickens' account in his
"Pickwick Papers" of the
Eatanswill election.
