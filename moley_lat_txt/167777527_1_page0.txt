CLERGY AND PUBLIC ALERT
The Supreme Court Must Face
Up to Religious Controversies
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are 450 cases on
the docket of the Supreme
Court in the current ses-
sion, and of these, 26 have
a direct or indirect bear-
ing on religion or religious
freedom.
Five of these concern
the constitutionality of
state laws which prohibit
business and commercial
activities on Sunday—the
so-called "blue laws"—
which are mostly distin-
guished by their violation
rather than their observ-
ance.
There has been constant
conflict at the state level
about these laws, and they
are so confusing that the
Supreme Court is going to
attempt to determine their
status.
There are also cases con-
cerning the reading of the
Bible in public schools,
and cases testing the con-
stitutionality of laws re-
quiring the observance of
religious holidays, such as
Christmas and Easter in
public schools.
Connecticut has a law
which will be tested. It
forbids the distribution
of information concerning
contraceptives, the use of
contraceptives, and the
prescription of contracep-
tive techniques by physi-
cians.
This will be very close-
ly watched by the clergy
of both Catholic and Prot-
estant churches. On this
subject the Catholic
Church has a firm stand,
and many Protestant cler-
gymen are solidly and
vigorously in opposition.
The new President will
have an eye on this case,
for it may well provide
him with the greatest of
all tests of the conscience
of which he spoke in ad-
dressing the Houston min-
isters in the campaign.
And a large part of the
clergy will be closely
watching him. This could
be a most explosive issue
in our foreign relations.
There is also a case
which concerns one Roy P.
Toracso, who has been de-
nied the right to serve as
a notary public because he
is a declared atheist.
The Hutterites are a re-
ligious group which be-
lieves in communal living
and common ownership of
all worldly possessions.
The Montana courts have
declared that this organi-
zation should be taxed as
a corporation. The Hutter-
ites have appealed on the
ground that their posses-
sions are religious proper-
ty. The Supreme Court
must decide.
Other cases deal with
the perennial conflict be-
tween public prudence and
literary license. Books and
plays of the Lady Chatter-
ly sort will be made best
sellers through judicial
notice and the subsequent
publicity.
But if I am not in viola-
tion of the tradition of the
press in venturing an
opinion on a subject which
is res judicata, there is no
way to prevent authors
and publishers from get-
ting such publicity other
than to permit the mails
and the bookstores to be
filled with demoralizing
smut.
As the distinguished ed-
itor of the Richmond News
Leader, James Jackson
Kilpatrick, amply docu-
ments in his book, "The
Smut Peddlers," the dan-
ger to public morals, es-
pecially juvenile morals,
is very great because of
printed matter much
worse than D. H. Law-
rence's famed book.
I heartily agree, inci-
dentally, with Kilpatrick's
opinion that, even aside
from the question of dirt,
"Lady Chatterly's Lover"
is a very bad novel. Except
for the smut, it would have
died a quick death.
There must be law and
regulations to prevent
such corruption, and the
courts are compelled to be
the final arbiters.
