RAYMOND MOLEY:
Nixon and Kennedy
Take a Good Stand
There are many soft-
headed people who, after
an election, would like to
have the two candidates
and the members of their
parties bury all differences
and enter into what would
be virtually a conspiracy
to govern the country
jointly.
This dangerous idea is
pressed to the point at
which the rivals would di-
vide the jobs between
them.
Many of the questions
by reporters directed to
Messrs. Kennedy and Nix-
on after their meeting in
Florida concerned wheth-
er Nixon would have a
job in the Kennedy gov-
ernment and how much
bipartisanship could be
expected.
*
The replies of the two
men brushed this nonsense
aside and revealed them
as the sort of leaders the
two parties have been
needing for nearly 40
years. They are essential-
ly party men. Both believe
in party loyalty and dis-
cipline, strong organiza-
tion, and healthful conflict,
not only during campaigns
but all the time.
Kennedy spoke of this
as "within the American
tradition." It is more than
that. It is in the pattern
of the Anglo - American
tradition of more than two
centuries. At least since
the time of the Elder Pitt,
the Earl of Chatham.
*
In his farewell address,
Washington decried "fac-
tions." But while he was
speaking, Jefferson was al-
ready at work creating an
opposition to the Federal-
ists. Later, the wise and
articulate John C. Cal-
houn gave us the best of
all definitions of two-party
government:
"The community will be
divided into two great par-
ties a major and a minor,
between which there will
be incessant struggles on
the one side to retain and
on the other to obtain the
majority-thereby to con-
trol the government and
the advantages it confers."
Those shallow Ameri-
cans who do not like that
sort of "struggle" to at-
tain or keep a majority
should move to the Soviet
Union, where there is no
party conflict, where the
head of the party is in fact
the head of the gover-
ment, where alleged vot-
ing offers only one choice,
and one ideology is au-
preme â€” a completely
monolithic state without
liberty for anyone. For in
party struggle is the life
blood of our individual
freedoms.
Kennedy said this to the
press:
"The Vice President has
responsibilities as the lead-
er of his party which
would come within the
American tradition . . ."
*
And in answer to the
question whether he
would give Nixon a job in
his administration, he add-
ed, "Mr. Nixon has a defi-
nite responsibility as lead-
er of his party and I think
that perhaps he can an-
swer how he would define
that responsibility more
satisfactorily than I can."
Nixon did define that re-
sponsibility:
"... There will be no
differences that we have
in these next four years
which will be based on
personal considerations.
They will be based only on
differences in principles
and policies which we may
have.
"I would like to add, too,
that as the senator indicat-
ed I have a responsibility
as the leader of the opposi-
tion at this time, and I
would like to say that as
the leader of the opposi-
tion it is my responsibility
to see that our opposition
is constructive, that we
support those policies
which we believe are in
the best interest of the ad-
ministration and of the na-
tion as well, whenever the
administration advocates
such policies, but that
where the new administra-
tion advocates policies that
we disagree with it is
our responsibility vigor-
ously to oppose them.
*
"We had such an under-
standing. The senator
agrees that that is the
proper role of an opposi-
tion party and of an oppo-
sition leader."
No such clear definition
of party leadership by both
candidates after an elec-
tion has been drawn since
the days of Bryan and Mc-
Kinley. This acceptance
of party leadership by both
men now is good news to
all lovers of free institu-
tions.
