RAYMOND MOLEY:
Assassination Poses
Crisis for U.S., Japan
The killing of the Jap-
anese Socialist Party lead-
er, Inejiro Asanuma, by a
terrorist right-wing youth
presents a very, very seri-
ous problem to the Jap-
anese government and al-
so to the government of
the United States.
It is not of major im-
portance in the situation
there to note that Asa-
numa was an avowed en-
emy of Japanese-Ameri-
can friendship and co-
operation. Nor the proven
fact that his relations with
the Communist regime in
China were close and, it is
reported, financially profit-
able to his political party
in Japan.
Nor that he had taken
the occasion of a trip to
China to declare in Pei-
ping his opposition to the
United States. Nor that it
was without hindrance
from him as a party lead-
er that the mob rule pre-
vailed which prevented
President Eisenhower's
visit to Japan.
All these circumstances
were well known in Japan
and to informed Ameri-
cans for a long time.
But the issue facing the
legitimate government of
Japan, vested as it is in
the Liberal Democratic
Party, is whether it is
competent enough and
strong enough to maintain
order. In 1958 it was un-
able to pass a police bill
which would have enabled
it to deal effectively with
internal subversion and
Communist influence,
mainly from Red China.
The weakness which
was then displayed led to
the mob rule this year at
the time of the confirma-
tion of the mutual secur-
ity treaty with the Unit-
ed States and the planned
visit of President Eisen-
hower.
Here was a nation of 92
million people which by
orderly elections had giv-
en the government, head-
ed by Prime Minister Ki-
shi, an overwhelming par-
liamentary majority. Yet
that government failed to
exercise its own clear
mandate.
Certainly that govern-
ment had enough force,
despite crippling restric-
tions unwisely imposed by
the United States occupa-
tion, to repress a mob of
Communist-inspired and
Communist financed ter-
rorists. But it failed to do
so, and Prime Minister
Kishi resigned and was
succeeded by Hayato
Ikeda.
It is now incumbent up-
on Prime Minister Ikeda
and his government to
move swiftly to assure or-
der not only against the
left-wing Communist-in-
spired mobs which will
again assemble, but
against the fanatical right-
wing group of which Asa-
numa's assassin was a
member. The assassin
should be quickly tried
and punished. Then Ikeda
should sternly warn all
who might attempt disor-
der, both on the right and
the left, that further dis-
order will be repressed
with all necessary force.
The first duty of a re-
sponsible Japanese gov-
ernment is to protect its
parliamentary authority,
granted by the vast ma-
jority of its decent silent
citizens. Without that,
chaos is inevitable.
Its duty further is to
restore the confidence of
other nations in Japan's
stability.
This cannot wait until
a dissolution of the pres-
ent government and an-
other election. The plan is
to dissolve this govern-
ment and to elect a new
Parliament in November.
It is confidently believed
that the Ikeda government
will be returned to power
by a large majority. But
stern measures cannot
wait for that. The time
for decision is now.
The United States has
an enormous stake in the
restoration in Japan of or-
derly government friendly
to us. It should be made
clear by the government
of the United States that
American confidence in
Japan as an ally, a friend,
and a trading partner
should be restored by
strong measures by a
strong government.
It is already clear that
public opinion in the Unit-
ed States has turned from
faith in Japan it has
had since the end of the
occupation to fear and dis-
trust. It is of vital inter-
est to the whole position of
the United States in the
Far East in its struggle
with Communist imperial-
ism that confidence in the
stability of Japan be re-
stored.
At the moment in this
political campaign Presi-
dent Eisenhower is being
attacked, unjustly it is
true, by the Democratic
Party for the alleged "fail-
ure" of the President's
mission to the Far East.
The people of the Unit-
ed States as well as the
people of Japan must real-
ize that if Japan falters
the entire Far East will be
lost to communism. Our
"new frontier" would be
at Hawaii and California
and Alaska. It is just as
serious as that.
And for Japan the loss
would be disastrous. For
its miraculous recovery
would be wiped out, and
the nation would be at the
mercy of Communist im-
perialism. Japan lost a
great deal because its mil-
itarists decreed that it
could risk war with the
United States. But it re-
covered from that defeat.
Engulfed in the Commu-
nist tide, it would lose all
it has gained in the cen-
tury since it emerged into
the modern world.
Only by its own prompt
and resolute action can
Japan be saved. That is
the challenge to Prime
Minister Ikeda.
