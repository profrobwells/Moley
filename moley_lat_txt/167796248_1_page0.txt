Nixon Won Where
GOP Was Organized
While Ralph Waldo Em-
erson wrote an essay on
politics, I am sure he knew
little of the practical side
of that ancient art. If he
had, he would not have ap-
plied to elections his com-
ment about the man who
made a better mouse trap
and who found customers
beating a path through the
wilderness to his door.

For in politics a fine can-
didate may have better is-
sues, but without organ-
ized effort in his behalf he
will lose. In politics organ-
ization comes first; next,
there is the attractiveness
of the candidates; and,
finally, there are appealing
issues.
Without expressing at
this point a comparison of
Kennedy and Nixon as
candidates or a preference
between what they pre-
sented as issues, let us
test the foregoing principle
by the results of the elec-
tion.
In the big states which
clinched the election—
New York, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Illinois and Mis-
souri—enormous major-
ities in the big cities
crushed the rest of the
state.

In Chicago Mayor and
boss Daley whipped his
field commanders to prodi-
gious efforts. High among
those subbosses is Con-
gressman William W.
Dawson, who rules Chica-
go's grimy South Side with
a fist of iron. The Negro
constituents who prevail
in his Congressional Dis-
trict give him awesome
obedience. In the House
of Representatives, his 18
years of service have given
him the chairmanship of
the important Government
Operations Committee. He
was considered by the
President-elect for post-
master general.
Similar commanders ap-
pear in many of the other
major cities. All these
forces operated with prac-
ticed skill. Those states
were vital to the national
ticket. The margin of votes
was in the cities and organ-
izations which got out the
votes.
Outstanding among the
big states were two which
were carried by Nixon.
They were Ohio and Cali-
fornia. In both states the
Republican Party suffered
crushing defeats in 1958.
The shock was so great
that Republican leaders
were almost in despair aft-
er the election. But in both
cases a few dedicated
people went to work be-
fore the year 1958 ended.
While I live in New
York and vote there, I
know more of Ohio and
California than any of the
other states. Both were in-
teresting examples of con-
fidence in organization.
In Ohio the job of re-
building fell upon State
Chairman Ray Bliss. His
problem and that of the
many Republican workers
who lived in Cleveland
was to keep down the cer-
tain Kennedy majority in
that city and at the same
time work in the other 87
counties to create an off-
set.

On the basis of a heavy
Democratic registra-
tion stimulated by the ef-
forts of labor's COPE the
Democratic aim was to get
a Kennedy majority of not
less than 250,000 in Cuya-
hoga County.
When I visited Cleve-
land two weeks before the
election, Republican lead-
ers told me that they
hoped to cut the Kennedy
majority there down to
100,000. They did not ac-
complish that miracle, but
did succeed in reducing
the majority to less than
150,000. The operations
elsewhere in the state
made up for that margin,
and the state went to Nix-
on-Lodge by 270,000.

In California the great
prize is the immense vote
in Los Angeles County,
with county chairman,
former Congressman
Pat Hillings, reinforced by
a volunteer group, the Re-
publican Associates, the in-
credible happened. Of the
Republicans registered,
97.5% were gotten to the
polls, while more than
100,000 registered Demo-
crats voted for Nixon-
Lodge. Thus of all the
major urban areas in the
nation, the Kennedy plu-
rality was the smallest—a
mere 21,321. Organized ef-
fort elsewhere in the state
easily made up the differ-
ence.
The lesson is clear. Or-
ganized efforts win elec-
tions. Neither candidates
nor issues can win without
organized, year-round ef-
forts to get out the vote.
This is the hard lesson that
the Republican Party over
the nation must learn.
