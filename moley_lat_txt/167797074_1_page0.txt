HIS REGIME MUST FALL
Castro's Revolution Following
the Classic Historical Pattern
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Dispatches from Miami
tell us of the various
waves of refugees from
Cuba in the two years fol-
lowing the triumph of
Castro's motley band of
adventurers. First there
appeared on our shores
the gamblers and racket-
eers who had prospered
under the dictatorship of
Batista. Their ill-gotten
gains for the most part
preceded them. They need
no sympathy or aid. They
will ply their grimy trade
somewhere else.
Next came to American
asylum the disillusioned
idealists who had believed
Castro to be a messiah.
Now, with their idealism
undiminished and with de-
votion to the common peo-
ple of Cuba, they form the
hard core of counter rev-
olution.
Then there arrived
thousands of middle-class
Cubans who were little
concerned with ideology
but wanted to continue
their lives peacefully with
any sort of government.
For the most part, they
are dispossessed of what
they owned before Castro
came. In their ranks there
are many who must be
cared for somehow in the
United States, and they
are dependent upon pub-
lic and private charity.
It is estimated that there
are more than 100,000 such
displaced persons in this
country now.
And back in Cuba are
the masses who are find-
ing life hard to sustain on
Castro's oratory, his incite-
ments to hatred, and the
crumbling economy which
his bungling minions are
unable to vitalize.
Revolutions always be-
gin with some real or al-
leged idealistic purpose.
In a bottom-up revolution
like the one managed by
Castro, the announced
purpose is to ameliorate
the condition of the mass-
es and to destroy the ex-
ploiters. In a top-down
revolution, it is to restore
law and order and to get
rid of incompetent dema-
gogues.
There have been many
books about revolutions.
One which carefully ex-
amines the anatomy of
revolution appeared some
years ago. It is "Revolu-
tion," written by Robert
Hunter after years of
study and research.
Hunter found a com-
mon pattern. Revolutions
have almost always been
attended by war and infla-
tion. In France the fiscal
system got out of hand be-
fore trouble started in
1789. Poverty swept the
masses in Paris, and
France's centralized gov-
ernment made it easy for
a minority to seize con-
trol.
Elsewhere in the nation
the revolution failed to get
popular support. In the
Vendee, especially, there
was armed resistance and
also the protection by the
peasants and townspeople
of Royalists and counter-
revolutionists.
The revolutionary gov-
ernment attempted to
unite the French people
by crying out against for-
eign influence and, finally,
by creating war. But Na-
poleon found it possible to
overthrow the incompe-
tents because he had ready
for his purposes a large
majority of the French
people.
Whether there is such
substance in the small na-
tion of Cuba, or whether a
minor Napoleon will ap-
pear is mere conjecture, at
this time.
Some revolutions, like
our own and that of the
Bolsheviks of Russia, suc-
ceed and establish perma-
nent institutions. Most fail
because of their own bun-
gling, corruption and ex-
cesses.
But as we witness the
economic disorganization
of Cuba, the utter incom-
petence of what remain of
Castro's intimates, and his
own pathological veerings,
we must conclude that he
cannot remain in power a
great while. For human
needs are paramount and
must be met, and the pat-
tern of reaction must have
its way.
