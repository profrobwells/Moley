Since President-elect
Kennedy has finished his
Cabinet making, there is
much discussion about
what a Cabinet is and
what it does. The answers
to these questions are in
the schoolbooks. The Cab-
inet as a group advises and
informs the President.
And the members admin-
ister departments with
tens of thousands of em-
ployees.
But should it be a rep-
resentative body, and, if
so, what should it repre-
sent? This question has
never been clearly an-
swered. Nor have Presi-
dent and Cabinet members
ever given an indication
that they are clear about
this important question.
*
The ideal is that Cabinet
members represent the
United States and all of its
people, just as the Presi-
dent and the Vice Presi-
dent are supposed to do.
But in practice that ideal
has been more and more
slighted.
Since the Kennedy re-
gime will be highly prac-
tical, the selections now
before us move to an ex-
treme never before real-
ized. Party service, regions
and minority groups are
represented — especially
minority groups.
It is true that the
growth of the Cabinet
since Washington has to a
degree invited this sort of
representation. In the be-
ginning there were four
members — State, Treas-
ury, Army and Attorney
General. It was a selection
of distinguished men: Jef-
ferson, Hamilton, Gen.
Henry Knox and Edmund
Randolph.

In 1789 there was added
Navy; in 1829, Postmaster
General; in 1849, Interior;
in 1889, Agriculture; in
1903, Commerce and La-
bor; in 1913, Labor, and in
1953, Health, Education
and Welfare.
If some zealots have
their way, there will be sec-
retaries of peace, culture,
senior citizens, urban af-
fairs, and possibly chiro-
practors, and auctioneers.
In the new Cabinet, la-
bor will be represented by
one of its most prominent
employees, Arthur J.
Goldberg. Gov. Orville L.
Freeman carries to the
Department of Agriculture
his thorough adherence to
the radical views of the
Farmers' Union. His in-
tellectual and policy men-
tor has been Dr. Willard
Cochrane of the Universi-
ty of Minnesota, a Kenne-
dy adviser in the cam-
paign and reputed major
architect of the Democrat-
ic farm program.
Rep. Stewart L. Udall
of Arizona rates in the
voting score 96% extreme
"liberal." This is especial-
ly true of his support of
public power develop-
ment. He will be policy-
maker in the Interior De-
partment. Eagerly seek-
ing the undersecretary-
ship in that department
is Clyde Ellis, powerful
lobbyist for federal power.
Since the great Negro
blocs in the large cities
played such an important
part in the election, they
were recognized in the of-
fer of the postmaster gen-
eralship to Rep. William
L. Dawson, boss of the big
First District in Chicago.

The selection of Robert
Kennedy for attorney gen-
eral recognizes not only
brotherly love, but Rob-
ert's capacity as a party
organizer and his knowl-
edge of where patronage
should go later. There is
nothing in his legal career
to merit the most impor-
tant law office in the na-
tion.
Gov. Luther Hodges,
having been a business-
man but also an ardent
Kennedy supporter, is
presumably intended to
represent business and
employers' interests:
If these are to represent
some of us, who will rep-
resent all of us?
