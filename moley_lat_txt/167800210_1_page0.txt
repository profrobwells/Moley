A KENNEDY GESTURE?
Political Facts Behind Dawson
Refusal of Postal Appointment
It would be interesting
to know what Southern
citizens are now thinking
— citizens who switched
from Nixon to Kennedy be-
cause Henry Cabot Lodge
made the unauthorized
promise to name a Negro
to the Cabinet.
For President-elect Ken-
nedy offered the post-
master generalship to Rep.
William L. Dawson, who,
after this great honor was
conferred, declined with
thanks.
Dawson is the high im-
perial ruler of a Chicago
South Side district. His
empire includes the Chi-
cago Loop and runs south
and somewhat west of that
business center. Its popu-
lation is something under
400,000.
★
It comprises the First
Ward, which was in earlier
times bossed by the noto-
rious "Hinky Dink" Mc-
Kenna and "Bathhouse
John" Coughlin. In those
days, the area was famous
for graft, crime, and fraud-
ulent voting. Over the
years, emigres from the
Southern states have al-
most completely taken it
over.
Dawson was born in
Albany, Ga., 74 years ago.
He has been in Congress
since 1942 and is House
chairman of the powerful
Government Operations
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Committee. In "Who's
Who," he lists his appoint-
ment as vice chairman of
the Democratic National
Committee.
Dawson's control of a
huge, solid bloc of Demo-
cratic votes gives him
great power in the Chicago
machine of Mayor (and
Boss) Richard J. Daley.
After vainly struggling
with the bosses, two-term
Mayor Martin H. Kennel-
ly, a good public official,
was denied another term
and was succeeded by
Daley. Dawson was a main
factor in driving out Ken-
nelly.

Dawson's empire has a
grimy reputation in Chica-
go. It has been the scene of
lost votes, of election ir-
regularities, and of police
corruption. It has been in-
vestigated over and over
for lawlessness.
The boss of this district
is the man who was of-
fered a Cabinet office. Pre-
sumably this was in recog-
nition of the vast Kennedy
vote which his district pro-
duced. Also, it was a ges-
ture to the race which
played so large a part in
the Kennedy victory.
Since the Post Office has
traditionally been a source
of immense political pa-
tronage, there has been a
custom of awarding the
Post Office Department to
the man who most promi-
nently played a part in the
election of the President.
He has been by tradition
the shaker of the plum
tree.
Many, such as Will
Hays, James A. Farley and
Arthur Summerfield, were
previously chairmen of the
national committees of
their parties. John Wana-
maker received the honor
from President Benjamin
Harrison. He had been a
member of the executive
committee of the Republi-
can Party. But he was a
man who stood for clean
politics.
Certainly Dawson is an
unusual choice, despite
his party activities, for
heading such a tremen-
dous business organiza-
tion. There were doubts—
perhaps a certainty—that
Dawson would not accept.
★
But the gesture is of in-
estimable importance to
the minority of which
Dawson is so powerful a
member. One need not be
a cynic to believe that the
gesture was all that was
necessary. But it shows
how little the present peo-
ple in control of the Demo-
cratic Party care about the
vote of the Southern
states. And how purely po-
litical the new administra-
tion promises to be.
