Inept Bureaucracy Is
Responsible for Cuba
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is now clear that the
rise of Castro was per-
mitted by the misguided
efforts of the State De-
partment. It is also clear
that the recent "libera-
tion" fiasco must be laid
at the door of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
In both cases a bureauc-
racy prevailed over what
might have been the het-
ter judgment of those who
should formulate military
plans.
Late last summer the
Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee published hearings in
which Sen. Thomas Dodd
of Connecticut elicited
some shocking statements
from the two ambassa-
dors, Gardner and Smith,
who had served in Cuba
in the Eisenhower admin-
istration.
Their testimony was
that after a briefing in the
State Department de-
signed to impress upon
them the sincere and hu-
manitarian purposes of
Castro, they found after
arriving in Cuba that this
was not true.
They learned the facts
about the Cuban dictator's
earlier doings in South
America and also about
the Communist objectives
of the people who sur-
rounded him.

Both ambassadors made
unsuccessful efforts to get
the facts to Secretary
John Foster Dulles and
President Eisenhower.
They did not get beyond
the "fourth floor" in the
State Department, where
the bureaucrats hold forth.
The real truth about
Castro was known to Vice
President Nixon. In 1959,
after an appraisal of Cas-
tro based upon a three-
hour interview, he sub-
mitted to the President a
memorandum stating that
Castro was acting in the
interest of communism
and that the United States
should prepare guerrillas
for the overthrow of the
Castro regime.
This urgent appeal was
frustrated by people in
the State Department who
were still deluded into
thinking that Castro could
be made to behave by
mild persuasion.
A precious year passed
until the decision was
made that Castro must be
overthrown. Then the
training began, and plans
were made for a real
counter-revolution.
In one of the campaign
debates, Sen. Kennedy
brought out the testimony
given by the ambassadors
to Sen. Dodd. But Nixon
was unable to reply be-
cause that would mean
that the President had
been misguided by his
own bureaucracy.
But now Nixon is un-
der no such restrictions.
His spirited attack upon
Secretary Udall's boo-boo
shows that.
Quite properly, Presi-
dent Kennedy has as-
sumed full responsibility
for the recent unsuccess-
ful and abortive landings
on the island.
But the basic fact
should be understood by
the public that the failure
to prevent Castro from
getting his present foot-
hold as well as his suc-
cess in defeating the
guerrillas is due to the
immense bureaucracy
which has entwined itself
over the decision-making
heads of our government.
★
Although as Vice Presi-
dent Nixon was powerless
to do anything about cut-
ting the coils of bureauc-
racy and because of his
position he was unable to
talk about it, there is no
doubt about his feeling
that we were in general
badly served by a consid-
erable number of the
members of the foreign
agencies of the govern-
ment.
Had he been elected,
a major housecleaning
would have been in order.
But he was not elected.
His successful opponent
was elected, and these
facts should move the
President to act with his
habitual vigor to see that
a bureaucracy is created
which will help and not
hinder the interests of the
United States.
