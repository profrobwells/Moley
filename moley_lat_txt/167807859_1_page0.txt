The British Medical Care Example
With the Kennedy pro-
posal for medical care for
the aged before Congress,
prudent people should
weigh the arguments in
its favor against Britain's
12 years' experience with
its Health Service.
At the moment, there is
an uproar in Parliament
over the proposals of the
Conservative government
to impose small charges
upon the beneficiaries to
cut the rapidly increasing
burden upon the financial
resources of the govern-
ment.
When the Labor govern-
ment blithely extended
free medical care to all
and the late Aneurin
Bevan was made minister
of health, very few of the
sponsors realized how fast
the costs would rise when
such services were free to
all.
★
Sir Stafford Cripps, who
was then chancellor of the
exchequer, was apprehen-
sive and stated his inten-
tion to limit the cost to
400 million pounds. But
hardly a year had passed
before it was realized that
malingerers and hypo-
chondriacs would press the
costs far beyond any ra-
tional estimate.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In his report to the
House of Commons, Health
Minister Enoch Powell re-
ported that the costs
would rise 11% in the next
fiscal year. That would
follow an increase in the
present year of 8%, and in
the previous year of 6%.
★
With such increases it is
obvious that this one item
in the welfare state would
get beyond the capacity of
any government to sustain
it, even though it has been
necessary to reduce Brit-
ish military commitments.
The estimated sum for
the Health Service this
year is 867 million pounds,
or more than twice what
it was initially, despite
the charges already im-
posed on the beneficiaries.
Powell, whose govern-
ment has accepted the
Health Service as a good
and necessary activity of
the government, explained
that there was no intention
to cripple the service, but
to provide some money to
improve and modernize for
hospitals.
To make the opposition
to increased charges more
formidable, the British
medical profession, already
won over to government
medicine, is intent upon
increasing the charges to
the government for the
services of doctors and
surgeons.
The parliamentary La-
bor Party, headed by
Hugh Gaitskell, has
jumped into the fight and
is seeking to censure the
Conservative government.
The additional charges
recommended by Powell
are an increase for pre-
scriptions from 1 to 2 shil-
lings; on dentures and
spectacles, a few shillings
each; and a charge at cost
for orange juice and vita-
mins.
★
The savings would be
65 million pounds — con-
siderably less than the
projective increase in the
costs in the next fiscal
year.
Thus, when we are
asked to take the long
step toward government
medicine in the proposed
help for the aged, it will be
well to take all estimates
of cost with a large grain
of salt.
Britain has found that
free medical care can
never be estimated in ad-
vance. We should heed
that warning.
