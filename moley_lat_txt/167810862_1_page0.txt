Academic Responsibility Ignored
by Professors in Election Report
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Three individuals from
the Political Science De-
partment of the Univer-
sity of Chicago, one of
them recently retired after
more than three decades
of teaching, have issued a
report commenting upon
the alleged frauds in count-
ing and reporting the vote
in Cook County in last No-
vember's election.
They are Jerome G. Ker-
win, retired, Herman Finer,
and C. Herman Pritchett,
active. They call it a
"sober and responsible
evaluation of the charges"
of fraud.
The report in the main
is not an examination of
the facts involved. It is a
running commentary upon
the publication in the press
of the efforts of Chicago
citizens to get the facts
upon which grave charges
of fraud have been based.
The circumstances sur-
rounding this report call
for comment concerning
its nature, the conditions
under which it was writ-
ten, the time and facilities
used in its preparation,
and the propriety of indi-
viduals enjoying the priv-
ileges, immunities and
standards of a great insti-
tution of learning, teach-
ing and research in making
such a report.
It was undertaken, so
the professors say, after a
telephone call by Prof.
Finer to Mayor Daley.
The report says that the
reason given to the mayor
was to "counteract" the
unfavorable impressions
over the nation about the
competence and integrity
of the electoral process
for which the mayor, as
supreme boss of the city,
must assume such great
responsibility.
In short, the offer of
the professors was to
make a report which
would help the mayor in
his denial that widespread
frauds existed. Thus the
bias of the report and its
reporters was comfortably
established before the "re-
search" began.
The professors conduct-
ed no first-hand examina-
tion of the facts at issue.
Those who have been
pressing the investigation
were not interviewed. In
telling of sources of infor-
mation, acknowledgment
is made to only one per-
sonâ€”the publicity man
who serves Mayor Daley.

I can speak with the au-
thority of an individual
who in academic life di-
rected many minute and
painstaking studies of
crime in American states
and cities, including Chi-
cago, when I say that to
justify putting the imprint
of a man in academic life
upon a study of such mag-
nitude as this there would
have to be at least a year's
time by a competent staff,
with finances of not less
than $100,000 for expenses.
This study was done in a
few weeks, with apparent-
ly, no aid other than that
of the publicity man and
the free time of the pro-
fessors.
The four newspapers
that were hauled over the
coals were the Tribune,
the News, the Sun-Times,
and the American.
These men, as teachers
of political science, must
know that there is some-
thing in the ethical codes
of journalists and profes-
sors which should compel
restraint in commenting
on facts which are still un-
der judicial process. The
alleged frauds are at this
moment, and will continue
to be for a long time to
come, in the courts.
As individuals who
would scarcely be men-
tioned in the press or oth-
erwise, the relationship of
the professors to the Uni-
versity of Chicago gives
them their sole reason for
prominence. Their person-
al qualifications for such a
study are, on the record,
negligible.

The academic world has,
can, and should contribute
mightily to public affairs
and the public interest.
But in such incursions into
political controversy it
should have a deep sense
of responsibility. There is
no evidence of such re-
sponsibility in this report.
