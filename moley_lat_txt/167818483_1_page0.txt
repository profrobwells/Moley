Kennedy Farm Proposal Confirms
the President's Political Acumen
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Any doubt that President
Kennedy has sharp
and adaptable political
skills must be dissipated
by an examination of the
farm program which he
has committed to the min-
istrations of Congress.
He has moved a considerable
distance since a
few years ago when he
voted as a senator against
rigid farm supports and
then later in the Wisconsin
primary a year ago,
under attack for that vote
by Sen. Humphrey, practically
admitted that he
had been mistaken.
After examining the
election returns he drew
the conclusion that the
farm states had rejected
the program proposed in
the 1960 Democratic platform.
For Nixon had carried
that part of the country.
And so, with pressing
and critical foreign problems
to meet, he has shifted
to Congress the responsibility
for solving the insoluble
with a plan by which
Congress itself can
in turn give the farmer
a chance to tackle the job
himself.
In essence, the farmers
will elect from producers
of 250 different farm commodities
advisory committees.
Then, when the
price of a commodity falls
below a certain level, the
advisory committee for
that commodity, with the
secretary of agriculture,
will work out a plan or
program to raise prices.
Since any such program
will involve some sort of
controls, the producers of
that commodity will have
a vote. If two-thirds vote
for it, the plan will go to
Congress, which will have
60 days to veto it if it
chooses. Without a veto
the plan will go into effect.
If Congress fails to
adopt the plan, its members
will endure the
blame or reap the praise.
If the large powers given
to the secretary of agriculture
result in such unpopularity
as Secretary
Benson was compelled to
bear, the President will
simply have to get another
secretary of agriculture
and then begin all over
again.
Meanwhile, months and
years will elapse during
which the President can
turn his mind to many
things other than agriculture.
Another factor must be
considered in this method
of gaining time. Confronting
each other in the referenda
among the farmers
are two farm organizations,
the Farm Bureau
Federation and the Farmers'
Union. Their policies
are so different that it may
be impossible to get the
necessary two-thirds majority
for any plan for controls.
That provides another
escape for the Congress,
the secretary and,
finally, the President.
Perhaps in the meanwhile
the farm problem
will settle itself through
the inexorable processes
of economic laws. There is
actually a good chance for
such a result.
In that case, Mr. Kennedy
will have a fine argument
for re-election in
1964, an argument backed
not by anything he has
done but what he has accomplished
in avoiding
what might well be an
unworkable and ruinous
course of action.
