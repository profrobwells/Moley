It Is Much Too Early to Predict
the 1964 Presidential Candidates
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It seems to me that
those who pay me the
tribute of reading these
few lines are entitled to
some inside information
occasionally, although I
am inside nothing but a
very perplexing country
in a troubled world.
But now I wish to re-
count a bit about how
these "brief chronicles of
the time," commonly
called "columns," are con-
ceived and born. In short,
the intimate life of a
columnist, as told to him-
self, by one who has
labored prodigiously for
27 years.
Our job is not just to
write but to plan. Since
these oracular utterances
are not instantaneously
transmitted to a listening
and reading public, we
must look a bit ahead. We
have to think about what
is true and important.
And then we have to
think of you, dear reader,
and what will interest
you, or what you will
think worth reading.
Then, after a decision is
made about what I am to
write, I must fill in the
gaps with information.
That involves reading and
telephone calls. The ad-
vantage of writing in New
York about half the time
-and I assure you that it
is the only advantage-is
that there are many ex-
perts in the telephone
book and plenty of cen-
ters of specialized knowl-
edge.
Then comes the rough
sketch on a tablet, to get
logic and order into the
offering. Then the typing
of a draft, which is short
work. Then the second
and sometimes the third
typing, to get the lan-
guage right.
It isn't the time of writ-
ing that counts; it is the
preparation.
Now, there come times
when there has been no
time for planning. Re-
search about Lumumba
becomes waste paper
when Lumumba dies. Or
there seems to be nothing
much of importance to
plan.
Out of that difficulty, I
must inform you, come
such writing as specula-
tions about who is to run
for President in 1964.
Now I shall present a
brief synopsis of a col-
umn which I have written
every four years since,
roughly, 1947. This is the
time to repeat it—at this
moment about four months
after the Presidential elec-
tion.
As in other years, I have
carefully gone over the
candidates since 1860 and
have asked myself the
question whether, three
years before the conven-
tions, one could possibly
have hit on the nominees.
First, we eliminate fore-
gone conclusion. Then we
consider the remainder.
The statistical count is
that of 37 of the nominees
of both parties over those
100 years, only eight
would have been dreamed
of three years beforehand.
The emergence of serious-
ly considered candidates—
not just that host who take
themselves seriously—is
almost always after the
mid-term congressional
and gubernatorial elec-
tions.

Consider these as prime
examples: Lincoln in 1857,
Hayes in 1873, Hancock
and Garfield in 1877, Cleve-
land in 1881, Harrison in
1885, Bryan in 1893, T. R.
and Parker in 1901, Taft
in 1905, Wilson in 1907,
Hughes in 1913, Harding
and Cox in 1917, Coolidge
and Davis in 1921, Hoover
in 1925, Roosevelt in 1929,
Landon in 1933, Wilkie in
1937, Stevenson in 1949,
Kennedy, maybe, in 1957.
I am tempted to have a
quantity of copies made of
the foregoing, to have in
my pocket to pass out in
the next two years to in-
quiring people who ask the
inevitable question.
And this, my reader, if
you are still reading, is the
last of my speculations on
1964.
