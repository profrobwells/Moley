'LUCKY TO BE ALIVE'
Hazards of the 1960 Campaign
Were Too Great for So Little
In the course of the next
four years, responsible party
leaders should reconsider
the sort of campaigning
which we have witnessed
this year.
The public's curiosity
and the advent of new mechanical
devices have created conditions
which not only demand more from
the candidates than any human
beings should bear but frustrate
any real examination of the issues
by voters.

Television and the airplane
have not helped the public to
understand what is going on but
have physically endangered the
candidates themselves. Perhaps
democracy will, as it has in many
instances in world history, destroy
itself.
No one who saw, on the ground
or on the television screen, the
exhausted candidates in their final
two weeks needs to be told what
the physical exactions were.
We have heard a lot about the
times demanding young men as
candidates. The wisdom of that
can be questioned, but even young
men can be battered into the
ground by too much campaigning.
And considering the fact that many
ailments in these days, especially
coronary failure, become more
prevalent among men in

the 40s and 50s, this sort of
strain might well provide us, as it
has in the past, with Presidents who
are unable to bear the weight of
office after election. And the burdens
of the Presidency exceed those of
any other job on earth, excepting,
perhaps, that of the prime minister
of the Soviet Union.
The dizzying hopping from place
to place by air by the candidates
involves such hazards that only the
grace of luck has spared one or the
other, or even both, a fatal crash.
To meet an engagement in Boston,
Nixon flew into an airport which had
been closed because of dense fog.
On another occasion, the Nixon
plane made an instrument landing
at Casper, Wyo., in a snowstorm
which covered the ground to the
depth of 7 inches. The flight to Alaska
in November weather was nothing
less than a stunt.

And if one candidate had been
killed in the course of these perils and
exertions, the choice of the voters
would have narrowed to one. For,
despite provision for a substitution,
voters would have had little option
except to vote for the one they knew
best.
This sort of campaign provides
less education than that conducted
by William McKinley, who limited
his campaigning to his own front
porch. That was a campaign in which
William Jennings Bryan traveled
more miles and received relatively
few more votes than preceding
Democratic candidates who moved
sparingly and talked very little.
Since the pace of the campaigning
during the past six weeks called for
several speeches by each candidate
each day, no newspaper could reflect
in any detail what they were saying.
Toward the end, both candidates
were incessantly repeating themselves.

Speeches delivered in the midst of
howling mobs in Chicago, Los Angeles
and New York were reduced to a few
short sentences and gestures.
Stevenson, in 1956, and Nixon, to a
limited degree this year, tried to fill
in the gaps with papers on specific
subjects. But in the turmoil, these
were read by a relatively few. And so
an uninformed electorate has gone to
the polls to vote for two completely
worn-out candidates. Considering
what the candidates went through,
they are lucky to be alive.
