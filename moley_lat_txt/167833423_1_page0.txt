Harvard, Producer of Statesmen,
Now Offers a 'Teaching Machine'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Among the many marvels that have come out of
Harvard, including a new
flock of statesmen, is a machine that may solve the
alleged teacher shortage which the President is
talking about. Prof. B. F.
Skinner of that revered institution has come up with
a "teaching machine."

The pupil would be confronted with a machine
with various windows. In
one appears a question. In
another the pupil writes
his answer. Then he
pushes a button and the
correct answer appears. If
his answer is correct, he
scores himself a point —
or the machine does, or the
attendant does.

I am not sure what happens if the pupil's answer
is wrong. The explanation
is that when the pupil
muffs the question, "the
machine may go back over
the previous steps and repeat the process" until
even the most obtuse student gets the matter
through his head. Perhaps
a further exploration of
the possibilities will produce a device to drop a
dunce cap on the unhappy
dullard.

London's comic weekly,
Punch, in an article on the
machine says that all the
teacher will need do is to
hover about with a screw
driver and an oil can to
keep the machine going.
We wouldn't need
trained teachers for that,
nor even skilled labor. The
90,000 incompetent, untrained teachers that the
President has mentioned
would either move on to
the ranks of the unemployed or turn into machine
tenders.

Prof. Skinner is at pains
to say that the machine
does not teach. He says
that "the machine itself
does not teach. It simply
brings the student into
contact with the person
who composed the material it presents. It is a labor-
saving device because it
can bring the programmer
into contact with an indefinite number of students."

This would fit in well
with the purposes of the
professional associations
and other groups which
seek the concentration of
control of education in
Washington through federal aid.

For the schoolmaster
would not be the immediate teacher or attendant.
He could be in Washington
creating the lessons and
propounding the questions
and composing the answers, presumably in the
U.S. Office of Education,
with the National Education Assn. at his elbow.

That form of centralization through new mechanical
devices has already
made great progress. For
audio-visual material is already abundant to supplement teaching — material
such as slides, films, tape
recordings, and television
— and which could be prepared in the USOE.

However, there is already murmuring, among
some that this sort of
thing can bring about
enormous technological
unemployment among
teachers. One comment is
that this is the same sort
of thing that prompted
weavers in England a century or so ago to smash
mechanical looms as enemies of their livelihood.
