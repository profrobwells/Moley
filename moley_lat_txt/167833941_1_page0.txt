Members of Congress
Face Embarrassment
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sweet are the uses of
Judge Howard Smith's ad-
versity. Now that under
the powerful pressures of
the White House, Cabinet
officers and Speaker Ray-
burn the Rules Committee
has been enlarged by three
members, Smith and his
old colleagues intend to
slap through the commit-
tee many bills and send
them to the floor.
Then members who
have always excused the
failure of measures given
lip service by the liberals
will have to stand up and
be counted. Their excuse
has been eliminated.
This will cause no end
of pain to members. Be-
cause it has always been
so easy for members to in-
troduce bills which the
members concerned really
do not favor at all. Their
nominal support has been
given to satisfy this or that
pressure group or special
interest. Now they will
have to vote on them, and
in many cases by a yea
and nay count.

The whole "revolution"
was reeking with hypoc-
risy. There were always
means of getting bills be-
fore the House for a vote
despite the refusal of the
Rules Committee to ap-
prove it for action.
Three of those means
were: Calendar Wednes-
day, when all committee
chairmen have an oppor-
tunity to call bills up re-
gardless of what is done in
the Rules Committee; sus-
pension of the rules by a
two-thirds vote; a dis-
charge petition signed by.
in the present House, 219
members.
In a long statement one
of the House members
who voted with Rayburn
for the enlargement of the
Rules Committee has at-
tempted to explain why he
believes the three methods
noted above have been
useless.
He said that so far as
Calendar Wednesday is
concerned the various
committees must be called
consecutively on consecu-
tive Wednesdays. That
means, for example, that
the school aid bill would
have to wait until the
Wednesday arrived which
would permit the commit-
tee in charge of the bill to
have its turn. That might
involve a few weeks.
Next he said that the
suspension of the rules
requires unanimous con-
sent but adds that there
are ways to get around
that restriction by a two-
thirds vote.
Discharge by petition he
says was attempted but
failed because the spon-
sors of the petitions were
unable to get more than
about 100 signatures.
All of this is completely
specious argument. The
Congress of the United
States is a deliberative
body. That means simply
that hasty legislation is
generally bad legislation.
*
This especially applies
to the House where the
membership is so large and
the bills to be considered
are so numerous that mem-
bers have limited time to
acquaint themselves with
the mass of business on
which they may have to
vote.
What really happened
in 1960 was that after frit-
tering away five months
the coming of the political
conventions reminded
members that there were
only a few weeks left. The
various committees had
not done their homework
and in a great hurry they
sent to the Rules Commit-
tee a great batch of bills.
The Rules Committee
was, and is, responsible
for the careful examina-
tion of such bills and its
time was limited. Then the
leadership, nudged by Sen.
Lyndon Johnson, decided
that for the purpose of pro-
viding ammunition for the
Presidential campaign
Congress should be called
back for a short session in
August. Nothing much
happened because the at-
mosphere was not condu-
cive to deliberation.
Nothing much is hap-
pening now. The same
nonsense is being inserted
in the Congressional Rec-
ord with appropriate re-
marks by the member
making the insertion. The
change in the membership
of the Rules Committee
therefore will be meaning-
less, just as it was unnec-
essary when it was made.
