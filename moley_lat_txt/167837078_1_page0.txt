That the powerful influence in job placement of
Felix Frankfurter, when
he was professor at Harvard, has been passing to
his close friend, ex-secretary Dean Acheson, is apparent in many of the
high-level appointments to
the State Department and
the foreign service.
In the unseemly and unnecessary rush to erase all
traces of the Eisenhower
administration by new appointments, there have to
be many mistakes. But
the President has at the
other end of his telephone
the law offices of Covington & Burling, where Acheson sits in detached but
busy majesty.
Thus we return to the
days before 1953—the days
of the surrender of China
and the roots of the Korean war.
Prof. Abram Chayes of
the Harvard Law School
has been appointed to the
office of legal adviser to the
State Department. That
this is an important appointment with high rank
as a policy-maker is obvious. When matters of legislation come before Congress, this official, as a supposed expert in international law and custom,
must speak for the Department of State. He is supposed to know all the answers.
Chayes, before he was
appointed to his professorship, was with the Covington & Burling (Acheson)
firm. Before that, he was
law clerk to Justice Frankfurter. And his education
was at Harvard College
and the Harvard Law School.
Uppermost in the questioning of Chayes by members of the Foreign Relations Committee was his
attitude toward the Connally Amendment. Chairman Fulbright asked him
for his views, and he replied:
"I think the repeal of
the Connally Amendment
was supported by the last
administration and by Mr.
Kennedy, President Kennedy, when he was a member of this committee. It
is also pledged in the Democratic platform: I believe
Mr. Nixon in his campaign
also endorsed the repeal of
the reservation."
The fact is that Mr. Nixon changed his mind sometime before the campaign
began and supported substantially the import of
the Connally Amendment,
which was that the United
States should judge
whether a matter to go to
the International Court of
Justice was a domestic
matter.
Then Sen. Long took
over the questioning:
Sen. Long—"How
many judges are there on
the World Court?"
Mr. Chayes—"Sir, I am
sorry, I do not know..."
Sen. Long—"How many
Communist judges are on
that court?"
Mr. Chayes—"Well I
should—I don't know
that either, Sir..."
Sen. Long—"How
many judges are there on
that court from nations
which do not agree in any
respect to accept the jurisdiction, or permit their
countries to be tried
there?"
Mr. Chayes—"I do not
know that, either, Sir."
Sen. Long—"Well there
are four of them, you
might take my word for it—the Soviet Union, Poland, Argentina and one
other. Do you find it somewhat strange that there
would be nations that can
sit there with judges to
pass judgment on us, nations which do not permit
themselves to be tried before that court?"
Mr. Chayes—"I do not
deny at all that it is somewhat anomalous..."
Sen. Long—"How many
countries are there who
submit to unfettered jurisdiction by that court?"
Mr. Chayes—"I cannot
give you exact figures,
Sen. Long."
Sen. Long—"Would you
be surprised to know that
the only countries to submit to what you would
have us submit to are
Haiti and perhaps Lichtenstein and San Salvador?"
That, then, is the man
who is supposed to be an
international expert but
who believes that he is
bound by the Democratic
platform and campaign
promises. Prof. Frankfurter was a strict teacher,
and Acheson was a high-ranking student at Harvard. I wonder what they
think of their protege
now?
