Why Nixon Will Not
Run in California
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
California friends of the
Vice President with
whom I have spoken gen-
erally agree that he
should not run for gover-
nor in 1962.
Their reasons are very
convincing. Gov. Brown,
who won over Sen. Know-
land by a big majority in
1958, has lost greatly in
public favor. There is talk
of his getting some office
in the Kennedy adminis-
tration, thus removing
himself from contention
when his term expires in
1962.
But even if Brown
should remain and run
again, the Kennedy ad-
ministration plus the
AFL-CIO'S COPE would
throw tremendous forces
into California to elimi-
nate Nixon as a threat in
1964. And if Nixon should
run for governor and lose,
his political career would
be pretty well finished.
But the power of the
Democrats to accomplish
that end is not the reason
why so many of Nixon's
friends do not want him
to run.

One point which seems
to have escaped the peo-
ple in the East is the very
special attitude of the peo-
ple of California. They
would resent his nomina-
tion for the governorship
as a step toward a second
Presidential nomination.
They rightly regard the
governorship as no pawn
in a play for higher office.
When they elect a man
to run their state, they
expect to get four years'
service. However they
might like Nixon, they
would be likely to cast a
resentful vote against
him.

In 1944 (not 1948), Gov.
Dewey brought all sorts of
pressure at the time of
the Republican conven-
tion in Chicago on Gov.
Earl Warren to run with
him on the ticket.
Warren, whatever one
may think of some of his
decisions as a member of
the Supreme Court, is re-
garded by everyone who
knows him as an extreme-
ly canny politician. His
answer to Dewey's blan-
dishments was a positive
refusal.
He said that, since he
Richard M. Nixon
had been in office as
governor for only two of
his first four years' term,
the people of California
would vote against him as
Vice Presidential candi-
date because they wanted
him for service at home.
In 1948, when Warren
did accept the Vice Presi-
dential nomination, things
were different. He had
served California for six
years at that time, and it
was considered that he
deserved a promotion.

Friends of Nixon point
out that the governorship
of California is a full-time
job. If Nixon ran and won,
he would have little time
for the job of helping to
build up Republican
strength over the nation
in anticipation of 1964. As
a private citizen he can
command national atten-
tion and leadership
beyond 1962. His big vote
in 1960 assures him of
that.
It is not likely that
Nixon has yet made his
plans for the future. But
it is likely that the con-
siderations outlined above
would deter him from
running for the California
governorship. For he not
only is well equipped with
political acumen, but he
knows the people of his
native state and their
manner of thinking.
