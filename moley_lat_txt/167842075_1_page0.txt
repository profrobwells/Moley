Youth Conservation Corps Has
More Promise Than Peace Corps
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Any seasoned politician
will tell you that the most
important attribute of a
successful politician is a
sense of timing. In this
President Kennedy has
shown a slip in his in-
dubitable political skill by
launching his Peace Corps
before his proposed youth
conservation corps.
When the Peace Corps
was established by exec-
utive order with a director
who had plans and every-
thing, there were those
who wondered why, aside
from a spirit of adventure
and change young people
should volunteer to serve
without pay in somewhat
indeterminate missions to
indeterminate missions to
the world.
There were others who
wondered where on earth
a smart young statesman
like the President got the
idea.
One newspaper made
the comment that no
doubt the idea was a mod-
ified version of a sugges-
tion which the philosopher
William James made back
before the turn of the cen-
tury. In an essay entitled
"The Moral Equivalent of
War," James said that it
would be a wholesome
thing to organize an army,
not to fight a foreign ene-
my, but to assail nature by
subjecting it to the will
of men.
It was also suggested
that President Roosevelt
might have been thinking
about the William James
essay when he created by
executive order in 1933
the famous Civilian Con-
servation Corps.
Since I was serving the
President as a handy man
in those hundred days and
something had to be sent
to Congress every noon
I was asked by him to pre-
pare a statement about an
idea he had to establish
such an agency. When he
had elaborated it I asked
him whether he had ever
taken a course with Wil-
liam James in his Har-
vard days. He had not but
he had known about him.
But in 1933 there was
a lot of sound sense in
the President's idea. It
was in substance to re-
cruit and place un-
der semi-military disci-
pline a large number of
young men and boys to
work in clearing land,
planting trees, building
by-roads and other healthy
out-of-door activities.
A practical individual,
Robert Fechner, was
placed in charge and the
CCC became one of the
most practical of all New
Deal innovations. A great
deal of useful work was
done. But more important,
it took the young men
and boys off the streets
and out of the army of
unemployed and gave
them modest pay for
healthy out-of-door work.
The Peace Corps of 1961
is an entirely different
thing. The perils it faces
lie in the lack of training
which the young volun-
teers have for the cru-
sade they are expected to
carry on.
*
There is no use in send-
ing them merely college
trained people who, like
most college graduates,
have few if any skills and
little knowledge of the lan-
guages spoken in un-
developed countries.
If, as is reported, a
youth conservation corps
is to be established it has
a much more favorable
chance of succeeding. And
perhaps it will have a role
in character building. The
Peace Corps has no such
prospect.
