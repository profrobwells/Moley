The Perilous Illusion
of 'Aid to Education'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a previous column I
used the word "tokenism"
to describe most of the
present proposals for fed-
eral aid. A token, accord-
ing to Webster, is "some-
thing that serves as a
symbol."
In terms of money pay-
ments it is merely an item
to show "an acknowledg-
ment of an obligation." In
this case, applied to both
party platforms and can-
didates, it is a promise
made to win support in
terms of votes. It is a po-
litical obligation and the
bits of proposed benefits
are really tokens to meet
opulent political promises.
But such promises ig-
nite great expectations
and without analysis the
introduction of a bill in
Congress is likely to cre-
ate in the prospective
beneficiaries much more
heat than light.
I can bear witness to the
heat engendered. For what
I have written in opposi-
tion to federal aid to ele-
mentary and secondary
education has brought me
many abusive letters.
I am, it is said, an enemy
of education, of the
schools, of teachers and of
progress. In a less vehe-
ment tone I am told that I
know nothing of schools
or of the vicissitudes of a
teacher's life.
But perhaps the real
enemy of education and of
teachers is the politician
who excites expectations
without the means of sat-
isfying them. Perhaps the
friend is the person who
tells the hard truth.
I shall illustrate my
point by some actual fig-
ures embodied in the bills
in Congress to carry out
the President's school aid
plan. These bills are Sen-
ate 1021 and House 4970.
The data are from the Na-
tional Education Assn. and
compiled by the Tax
Foundation.
I use the figures for a
quite well-to-do state,
Ohio, and a state generally
regarded as poor, Missis-
sippi.
Since the amounts allo-
cated are to apply to
school construction and
also to teachers' salaries, I
assume that the amount
will be divided equally be-
tween the two purposes.
Ohio is scheduled to get
$28 million in round num-
bers. That means, under
my assumption, $14 mil-
lion for construction. The
amount planned to be
spent in capital improve-
ments under state and lo-
cal expenditures for 1960-
61 is $175 million. So the
federal aid would be about
7% of what is needed.
That $14 million must be
spread over a very large
state with thousands of
schools.
In Ohio the average an-
nual salary of teachers is
$5,570. If the $14 million
of federal money is spread
evenly the individual
teacher would get 3%
more.
Mississippi would get
enough to build 300 new
classrooms that would be
one-fifth of what is
planned for new construc-
tion in 1960-61. Teachers
in Mississippi get an aver-
age of $3,560 annually.
Under the Kennedy plan
their increase would be
$380 a year.
But teachers and school
boards in both states must
remember that they must
reckon with the citizens
who must vote on new
bond issues and elect
school boards. It has been
proved in many other
lines of federal aid that
citizens, legislatures and
even school boards are al-
ways deterred from rais-
ing taxes and taking more
from citizens when Uncle
Sam comes in with his
bankroll. The tendency is
to let Uncle Sam pay it.
I have been in Ohio and
Mississippi within the last
three months. And no one
can tell me that in both
states the increase in
wealth is not enough to
provide the new construc-
tion and the additional
teachers' compensation
which is needed.
Let us not delude our-
selves. Federal aid for
schools is an illusion, and
a dangerous one.
