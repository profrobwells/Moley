Presidential Life Span
Is Shorter Than Most
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the last 41 years the
nation has anxiously
watched the bedsides of
four of its eight Presidents.
There was Woodrow Wil-
son, who, during 18
months of his second term,
was a helpless paralytic.
During those months the
nation had no head.
Warren G. Harding was
an actuarial risk when
elected. Franklin D. Roose-
velt was known to those
who knew him best to be
perilously ill when he ran
for a fourth term.
Finally, Dwight Eisen-
hower was felled by three
serious attacks but had the
distinction of having his
doctors reveal every de-
tail of his physical prob-
lems.

In the most interesting
and meaningful book I
have read in a long time,
Dr. Rudolph Marx, a sur-
geon in Los Angeles, has
given us a detailed clinical
history of 30 past Presi-
dents. From these histories
certain similarities appear
which give significance to
the physical ordeal to
which Presidents, more
than most of us, are sub-
jected.
In the first place there
is the strain on the arter-
ies and heart which the
office itself imposes upon
a President. This, we learn
from these histories, is in
part caused by the inexor-
able demands which we
ourselves impose upon our
chief executive.
Next there is the se-
crecy which surrounds the
occasional illness of a
President. No one but his
intimates in 1893 knew
that President Cleveland
had been smuggled on a
private yacht and that on
the voyage an operation
was performed successful-
ly to remove a cancer
which necessitated the re-
moval of a part of his up-
per jaw.
There is also the confin-
ing life which a President
must endure. Lack of rea-
sonable exercise and nor-
mal living habits takes its
toll. Some Presidents,
according to the accounts
of Dr. Marx, accumulated
inches of waistline and
pounds of excess fat.
Grant, Arthur and McKin-
ley were victims of little
exercise and opulent din-
ners.
Also, the miserable cli-
mate in which a purely
political compromise
placed the nation's capi-
tal brought to Presidents
for at least a century ex-
posure to malaria, dysen-
tery and other ailments.
The hot summer has tak-
en a drain, notably in the
case of the stricken Gar-
field in 1881.

Incompetent security
precautions exposed Pres-
idents to the murderous
attacks of fanatics and
cranks. Lincoln, Garfield
and McKinley were the
victims of incompetent
protection.
In 1944 any informed
journalist knew the truth.
I tried at that time to sug-
gest the idea that Presi-
dent Roosevelt was risk-
ing his life in running for
a fourth term. I wrote in
a column a calculation to
prove that despite the
great increase in life ex-
pectancy among all of us,
the Presidency had been
running against the statis-
tics.

I found that the Presi-
dents before Lincoln had
lived an average of 70
years but that since Lin-
coln their average life had
been about 63. As it hap-
pened, President Roose-
velt died at a little over
63.
A similar calculation
now, because of the viril-
ity of Presidents Hoover
and Truman, would show
a smaller gap in the aver-
ages. Despite more sci-
ence and better medical
care, Presidents are as-
sured of fewer years than
average men.
