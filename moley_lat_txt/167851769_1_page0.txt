The John Birch Society Imperils
the Cause of True Conservatism
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a recent column I
stated my emphatic dis-
sent from the ideas, meth-
ods, and policies of Robert
Welch and his John Birch
Society. In a preliminary
way I outlined what I be-
lieved to be sound conserv-
atism. Now I wish to
come to specifics concern-
ing Welch and the said so-
ciety.
In an interview pub-
lished in the Los Angeles
Times, Paul H. (Tex) Tal-
bert stated his views con-
cerning the aims and meth-
ods of the society. He
seems to be a sort of depu-
ty grand exalted maestro
of the society, speaking for
the chapters in Southern
California. He was asked
about the "influences" of
which he disapproved in
the Los Angeles newspa-
pers. He replied:
"While Barry Goldwa-
ter, Morrie Ryskind,
Holmes Alexander and
Raymond Moley are all
right, look at the others
whose writings indicate a
sympathy for one-world
collectivism."
The four individuals
named are regular contrib-
utors of signed opinion
in The Times. So far as the
first three are concerned
they have the freedom and
the space to comment upon
the dubious compliment
extended by Talbert. I
hope they do. I shall do so
forthwith.
If Talbert is able to en-
compass in his strange ag-
gregation of beliefs what
I have been writing for
many years, along with
ideas of his beloved leader
Welch, his capacity for
self-delusion is unparal-
leled in the annals of psy-
chology.
Perhaps he equates all
who have expressed an op-
position to communism.
It is true that I have al-
ways been opposed to com-
munism.
All Americans except a
tiny minority hate com-
munism and the Commu-
nist conspiracy. I do not
doubt that President Ken-
nedy, with whom I dis-
agree on domestic issues,
hates communism.
But opposing commu-
nism, murder, arson and
treason does not make
men ideological brothers.
William Wilberforce in
England and John Brown
in America both sought
the abolition of slavery.
But Wilberforce sought
and attained his end in
the British Empire by
peaceful and constitution-
al means. John Brown by
his fanaticism made a
peaceful end of slavery
impossible and contributed
to the onset of a bloody
war.
The peril in the Welch
activities is that they will
endanger the growth of a
true conservatism in this
country.
The truly dangerous
part of the John Birch
Society is revealed in
Welch's Blue Book. It is
reported that this direc-
tive is to create a "mono-
lithic" body to be operated
under "completely author-
itative control at all
levels."
The absurdity embodied
in Welch's earlier book
"The Politican" in which
so many eminent and re-
spected Americans are la-
beled as dupes of commu-
nism falls of its own
weight. Now there is the
demand that Chief Justice
Warren be impeached.
In his proposal, Welch
is indicating that his brief
education in legal matters
failed to instruct him in
the nature of the impeach-
ment process. You cannot
impeach a man because
you disagree with him.
Those Americans who
are drawn into this society
because they believe it to
be an expression of con-
servatism are helping to
discredit all those who
seek sound and conserva-
tive solutions for our na-
tional problems. Birchism
is the antithesis of con-
servatism.
