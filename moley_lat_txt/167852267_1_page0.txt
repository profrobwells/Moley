Labor Bases Complaint of Press
Monopoly on Unsound Premises
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a recent issue of the
AFL-CIO News a speech
by Guy Nunn is reported
in which he bitterly com-
plains about an alleged
monopoly of the sources of
information by interests
opposed to labor and its
political programs and
ideas.
It is the familar refrain
after a national election
that there is a "one-party"
press committed to opposi-
tion to the "liberal" pro-
grams of the political
unions and favoring the
Republican ticket in na-
tional elections,
In the light of the rec-
ord, Nunn should be the
last person to make such
a complaint. He is the
voice of Walter Reuther
over the airwaves in Michi-
gan. His title is director
of the United Auto Work-
ers radio-television depart-
ment. For some years he
has been a twice-daily
commentator on the
"news" for that agency,
reaching substantially the
entire population of the
state. His "news" is heavi-
ly weighted and partisan
and ex parte propaganda.
â˜…
No Michigan newspa-
per, nor all the newspa-
pers there combined, can
rival the continuous bar-
rage of his loaded news.
But he is not satisfied with
this power. He describes
the labor unions as the
helpless victim of a news
monopoly.
Nunn's first complaint
in his speech is about the
death of the Detroit Times.
He blames this on the
newspaper tycoons. It was,
he says, "an act of almost
calculated cruelty."
No one will deny that
the death of a metropoli-
tan newspaper is a tragic
matter. It is a cruel blow
to many employees. But
it is not "calculated" to
hurt anyone. The tremen-
dous costs of running a
newspaper-costs largely
attributable to higher wag-
es for employees brought
about by the power of
unions-make it increas-
ingly difficult to maintain
morning competition in
the field.
But as was abundantly
shown in the past Presi-
dential campaign, there
was no "monopoly" of
news advantages for the
Republican ticket in the
nation's press. While edi-
torial support of the daily
newspapers themselves
generally leaned to Nixon-
Lodge, there certainly was
no disadvantage to Ken-
nedy-Johnson in the news.
More than half of the
signed columnists and
commentators leaned to-
ward the Kennedy-John-
son side.
I would estimate that
considerably more than
60% of the writers of the
news hoped for a Kennedy
victory and indicated that
preference in their cover-
age. All three national
news magazines predicted
the election of Kennedy
well before the election
on the basis of reports
from the working press
in the various states. And
in its effect that was a big
boost to the Kennedy
chances.
*
A considerable part of
the Washington press
corps preferred Kennedy
to Nixon, and that helped.
We have only to look
back on the Roosevelt re-
gime, during which the
President complained bit-
terly and continuously
about the predominance of
editorial opposition to him.
But the working press,
especially those participat-
ing in his press confer-
ences, fell under the spell
of his personality.
But despite these ad-
vantages, Nunn argues for
more strength in the labor
press-in which, inciden-
tally, there is no deviation
from the aims of labor in
the slanted news. To give
space and employment to
an opposition voice there
is as unthinkable as the
presence of an Armour or
Swift advertisement in a
vegetarian journal.
*
Nunn suggests that to
counteract the "anti-la-
bor monopoly" there
should be assessed against
every union member the
sum of $10 a year, as a
"modest and workable"
start in labor communica-
tion.
There is no compulsion
on the part of any citizen
to patronize the "capital-
istic" newspapers. But the
labor papers, of which
there are many with large
circulations, are support-
ed by dues-paying mem-
bers, regardless of their
personal politics or pref-
erences.
