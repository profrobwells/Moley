The Pot Calls the Kettle Black
In a widely published
interview, Undersecretary
of State Chester Bowles
has made an attack on the
advertising business in
which he was engaged un-
til he turned to a political
career 20 years ago.
His statements con-
veyed the idea that ad-
vertising generally is a
species of madness in
which a naive public is be-
guiled by the excesses
conceived on Madison
Avenue.
Bowles was born and
entered the advertising
business when it was pos-
sible for a man in business
to make a profit and save
it.
Under the various politi-
cal regimes which Bowles
has served so loyally since
the 1940s, taxes have been
raised to a point at which
few young Chester
Bowleses just out of col-
lege could now hope to
build their own business-
es.

Let us recall the per-
formance which millions
of us saw on television
last July. As you will re-
member, Bowles would
read a section of the plat-
form and then there would
be shown illustrative films
designed to excite in the
viewer horrified gasps and
prayers of thanksgiving
that something had been
preserved after the neg-
lect, deception and mis-
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
management of eight years
of Republican rule.
Any advertising which
attacks a competitive prod-
uct in such a manner
would subject its sponsor
to court action.
In any delineation of
historical fact an adver-
Thomas Jefferson taught
the danger of too much
government. The Bowles
platform promised to poke
the nose of the govern-
ment into every cranny of
our life
But the most shameful
violation of the most ele-
mentary ethical principles
in advertising was the
making of promises which
cannot be redeemed.
For example, he said
that a Democratic admin-
istration would raise the
rate of economic growth
to 5% a year, twice as
fast as our annual average
since 1953.

This downgrading of the
last seven years was ac-
complished by a numbers
game. It depends upon
what year you take as a
base. Also what kind of
dollars you are talking
about. Also because the
basic statistic used, the
gross national product, is
a fraud and illusion.
Bowles is living in a
glass house, the panes of
which are cemented by
political hypocrisy. He is
the last man in the ad-
ministration who should
be criticizing advertising.
Advertising as a busi-
ness is guilty of consider-
able bad taste and exag-
geration. But when com-
pared with the demagog-
uery of politics it stands
out like Mt. Hood on a
clear winter's day.
Moley
tising agency must protect
its client from ridicule
and contempt by scrupu-
lous accuracy. But the en-
tire theme of the Bowles
presentation was to trace
the parentage of the pres-
ently liberal wing of the
Democratic Party back to
Thomas Jefferson.
Indeed, Jefferson was al-
most as prominently pub-
licized as Bowles himself.
That historical claim, as
any schoolboy should
know, is the summit of
the absurd.
