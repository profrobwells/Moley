It Is Time to Review
the First Hundred Days
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The first hundred days
of the Kennedy regime
have passed into history,
and almost everyone who
has the privilege of writ-
ing in magazines and
newspapers has duly noted
the fact and has summa-
rized pluses and minuses.
Now there is a moment
for reflection.
There are circumstances,
to be sure, under which
a great deal can be done
in a short time. For ex-
ample, when divine omnip-
otence was the moving
force, the world was made
in a few days.
But I surmise that most
people now regard the use
of the word "days" in
Genesis as merely symbol-
ic and that the task of cre-
ating this globe on which
such strange and erratic
people live and quarrel
was really accomplished
only after some billions of
years.
Or there are times when
plans are meticulously
made which require only
a final touch, as when Hit-
ler conquered Poland.
After all, the chance of
achieving something won-
derful in 100 days, meas-
ured by the tests of his-
tory, was only 50-50. Na-
poleon failed. Franklin D.
Roosevelt succeeded. At
any rate, Mr. Kennedy did
better than the emperor
of France. He is still in of-
fice.

It all goes to show that
an individual may be a
wonderful candidate and
something quite different
as an executive. When the
Kennedy-Nixon debates
were shown, the public, or
at any rate a critical part
of the public, got the im-
pression of a race between
the hare and the tortoise.
The tortoise didn't win
as in the fable. He lost.
But Nixon lost two kinds
of voters. There were the
eager anticipators who,
while not quite clear about
what they wanted,
yearned for something dif-
ferent. Then there were
the die-hard conservatives
who believed that Nixon
should attack everything
that has happened since
1900 and promise to repeal
it.
But now as we look back
at the campaign it must be
granted that Nixon, after
nearly eight years at the
center of things, realized
that there were no easy-to-
take capsules which would
frustrate communism,
eliminate economic fluc-
tuations, provide everyone
with every want, and dou-
ble the rate of economic
growth. And being the
man that he is, he spoke
with care and responsibil-
ity.
The new President found
it easy to pour new ap-
pointments into the hopper
Moley
with incredible rapidity.
After eight years of Re-
publican control, there are
always plenty of unem-
ployed Democratic states-
men. Now, as we consid-
er the early behavior of
some of those who were
selected in haste, we must
realize that several have
been misfits,
In the Cuban affair, cer-
tain individuals, accus-
tomed only to the quiet of
a professor's study or a law
office, found themselves
managing a very difficult
quasi-military operation.
And their blunders are
written for all to see.

So far as Congress is
concerned, there should be
no criticism for its inac-
tion. It has been doing ex-
actly what the makers of
the Constitution intended
it to doâ€”to act as a brake
on an impetuous executive.
It could see no need for
quick action to end a re-
cession which was ending
without any help from gov-
ernment.
The Kennedy program
was not new. It was mere-
ly a rewriting of a lot of
legislative proposals which
Congress had heard about
and worried over during at
least two long earlier ses-
sions.
And so we find ourselves
with a President sadder
and, we hope, wiser. At
any rate, I imagine a lot
of Americans are wiser
than they were,
