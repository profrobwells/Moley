RULES COMMITTEE TARGET
The 'Liberals' Are Out to Kill
Orderly Legislative Processes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It was highly significant
that the wily Sam Ray-
burn, Speaker of the
House, publicly stated
that in the conference of
the President-elect with
legislative leaders the
status of the House Rules
Committee would not be
considered.
That committee has
held its place for many
years. And during 48 of
those years, Sam Rayburn
has been a member of
the House. The House, its
customs, its prestige, and
its independence are em-
bedded in the very fiber
of the Rayburn personal-
ity. The House and Ray-
burn have weathered ev-
ery storm. As an institu-
tion, the House is great-
er than the sum of its
members.
*
For many years it has
been the protector of the
liberties of the American
people from the caprice of
Presidents and Senates.
It has jealously guarded
not only itself but the in-
tegrity of the Supreme
Court as well.
In 1937, after President
Roosevelt had announced
to legislative leaders at
the White House his de-
cision to push through
Congress his plan to re-
organize (pack) the Su-
preme Court, the House
leaders entered a taxi to
return to "the Hill."
The veteran Hatton
Sumners of Texas, chair-
man of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, said quietly,
"Here, gentlemen, is
where I cast the chips.'
By this he meant that he
would oppose the Presi-
dent and his plan. And so
for four months, while the
conflict raged over the
country and in the Sen-
ate, Sumners simply re-
frained from calling a
meeting of his committee.
That meant that so far
as the House was con-
cerned, the President's
plan could not be voted
upon. Finally, with this
moral support from the
House. the Senate killed
the bill and saved the
court from executive dom-
ination.
*
The new President will
recommend a long list of
proposals to enact the
New Frontier. But while
the President may pro-
pose, the Congress will
dispose. And a lot of the
disposing will depend up-
on "Judge" Howard W.
Smith and the Rules Com-
mittee which he heads.
On the present 12-mem-
ber Rules Committee,
Smith and fellow Demo-
crat William W. Colmer
of Mississippi have fre-
quently joined with four
Republicans to create a
tie vote and thus prevent
bills from reaching the
House floor. This has in-
furiated the "liberal"
spenders. Now there are
dire threats to "break"
the Rules Committee, ei-
ther by changing the
rules or by packing the
committee with "liberals"
or otherwise.
The answer is that
there are ways of getting
a vote on bills which have
not been given a green
light by the Rules Com-
mittee. On calendar
Wednesdays other com-
mittee chairmen may by-
pass the Rules Committee.
There may be a suspen-
sion of the rules by a two-
thirds majority. And a
simple majority of signa-
tures of members of the
House may enforce a dis-
charge petition.
One reason why these
methods are seldom used
is that a substantial major-
ity of conservatives and
moderates in the House
could frustrate such ac-
tion. Another is the re-
spect that members have
for the orderly method
provided by the Rules
Committee to sift legisla-
tion.
Most important, how-
ever, is the innate hypoc-
risy of those who intro-
duce radical bills. Politi-
cal considerations move
members to introduce bills
which in their own con-
science the sponsors do
not want to pass. They can
take credit from this or
that minority for sponsor-
ing or voting for measures,
and then blame the Rules
Committee for killing their
proposals. The Senate of-
ten passes bills which a
majority really do not fa-
vor, in the belief that the
House will not pass them.

The Rules Committee is
an integral pattern of our
form of government. Basic
in the constitutional sys-
tem are checks upon what
is called "the tyranny of
the majority."
Such tyranny may ap-
pear in every organized
element in our society—in
a town hall, a city council,
or a private organization.
There must be built-in
checks upon precipitate ac-
tion, or government will
end in chaos. Self-restraint
applies to governments as
well as to individuals.
