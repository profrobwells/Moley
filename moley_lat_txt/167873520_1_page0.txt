The GOP Must Choose a Leader
Let us suppose that the
large state of Tookaloose
is just completing a mag-
nificent turnpike running
the length of the state.
And that the governor of
said state places the fol-
lowing advertisement in
the newspapers:
"Wanted: A general
manager of a chain of res-
taurants and motels for
the new state turnpike.
Experience in hotel busi-
ness unnecessary. Full
time not required. No sal-
ary to be paid. But appli-
cant must be nice after-
dinner speaker."
Let us imagine what the
voters of the state, the
holders of turnpike bonds,
and the newspapers would
do to that governor. And
how soon his successor
would call in Howard
Johnson to take over the
state's motel and restau-
rant properties to oper-
ate them with the custom-
ary efficiency of that or-
ganization.

But certain Republican
national committeemen
are bound by the out-worn
tradition that neither ex-
perience nor full-time
service nor a salary is
compatible with good pub-
lic service. They are ap-
proaching the time in
June when the Republican
National Committee must
elect a party chairman.
And they are planning to
move in the old groove of
picking an after-dinner
narrator of stale jokes and
fire-and-brimstone politi-
cal homilies to run one of
the biggest semi-business
organizations in the Unit-
ed States, the national Re-
publican Party.
Rep. Miller of New York,
who is running like mad
for the job, has said that
full time is unnecessary, a
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
salary for the chairman is
merely to attract an unem-
ployed political hack, and
what is needed, in effect, is
a medicine man who can
harangue party dinners.
With a few notable ex-
ceptions, that is what the
paid chairman who would
have the energy and the
ability to supervise a com-
plete reorganization job.
An overhaul, if you please,
which would extend to
the grass roots of our
party nationally, just as
we did statewide in Ne-
braska in 1959-60. Our
party folks clearly want a
full-time, battle-scarred
organization-type national
chairman."
Mr. Thone has experi-
ence to back up his de-
mand. For with him as
state chairman the Repub-
lican ticket in 1960 re-
ceived the largest percent-
age majority of any state.
Men like Thone want Ray
Bliss of Ohio for chairman.
He picked up the Republi-
can Party in Ohio from a
crushing defeat in 1958
and rolled up the biggest
majority, numerically, of
any state for Nixon-Lodge.

But the Executive Com-
mittee of the Republican
National Committee seems
determined to by-pass the
valid claims of the Bliss
supporters and stick to the
old tradition. And aug-
menting the efforts of this
little governing group are
members of the swollen
bureaucracy of political
hacks who run the Wash-
ington office of the national
committee. They are, of
course, trying to preserve
their jobs.
This choice of a compe-
tent, paid, full-time nation-
al chairman is of vital im-
portance. For the first step
toward Republican reviv-
al must be to capture Con-
gress in 1962. Unless that
is done, no Presidential
candidate among the Re-
publicans who are men-
tioned stands a chance in
1964.
