GOP Chairman Should
Be a Full-Time Pro
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There is a saying that
military science teaches
people "to fight the last
war." But if the military
mind is frequently carti-
laginous, that of the poli-
tician is normally osseous.
No more dogmatic, super-
stitious, or unflexible breed
can be found among us.
This is emphasized again
as the Republican Party
prepares to select its next
national chairman.
One of the two men un-
der serious consideration
for the chairmanship of
the Republican National
Committee is Rep. William
E. Miller of New York. At
a $50-a-plate dinner he an-
nounced that to put the
position of chairman on a
full-time, salaried basis
would be "utterly ridicu-
lous." He has said that "a
paid chairman would be
nothing more than a glori-
fied member of the staff at
a fancy salary."
He feels that "the chair-
man, working for a salary,
would have in his mind all
the time the thought that
he would have to try to
please everybody or be
threatened with the loss of
his job."

"But, whether I am in
or out of Congress, I shall
not be the national chair-
man if I have to serve on
a salaried basis and take
orders from a large group
of 'employers' instead of
being able to fulfill the
function of national chair-
man as the party's political
leader," Rep. Miller de-
clared.
This position is, under
modern conditions, a per-
fect formula for defeat. At
a time when some Republi-
cans have realized that the
running of even a county
political organization relies
for its success upon a full-
time, salaried chairman,
Rep. Miller's opinion ap-
plies to the office of chair-
man of a great national
party.
It shows that a powerful
element in the Republican
Party is so frozen in obso-
lete tradition that under
normal political conditions
future Presidential and
congressional elections will
be lost.
Of course there have
been able men serving in
Congress who have served
as chairman, But the job
of leader of a national par-
ty organization should re-
ceive a man's full time and
attention. And a senator
or representative, to serve
his constituents well, has
more than enough labor to
occupy his full time and
attention without taking
on some outside, part-time
job.
To persist in this tradi-
tion in view of the enor-
mous organizational tasks
Moley
a national chairman should
do is dangerous folly. Not
only does the tradition
close the door on extreme-
ly capable men who could
not accept the position on
such terms, it robs the
position of its just due,
that of professionalism.
Professional politicians
in state and county organ-
izations would respect and
listen to such a man. And
he could command the re-
spect of that coy and cyni-
cal object of every poli-
tician's attention, the
press.

The principle of profes-
sionalism, of full-time, sal-
aried chairmanships with
established tenure has al-
ready been proved. The
best state organizations
have it. Large and impor-
tant counties have long
since abandoned compro-
mises concerning the office
of their organization chair-
men.
Too many mediocrities
or men who were able but
couldn't put in sufficient
time had been the differ-
ence between failure and
victory in too many elec-
tions. Private enterprise
was a fierce competitor for
managerial talent. So these
organizations pay good
men to do a hard job. To-
day our political parties
should pay well for their
men at the top.
