Rapping the Opposition
Pays Off Sometimes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Considering the manner
in which we writers for
the free press of America
on all occasions whack the
governments of our cities,
states, and nation and the
political figures who occupy
the seats of power
therein, it is rarely indeed
that we receive official
honors therefrom.
A certain lack of appreciation
for our devotion to efficiency
and economy by those targets
of our disesteem is quite
to be expected. For in
their exalted official position
they are more or
less sitting ducks inviting
those whose function is to
criticize and oppose.
About the only honor
that I have received in my
years of journalism was
the bestowal of a colonel's
commission some years
ago by the governor of
Kentucky.
Now I speak from a
heart overflowing with
gratitude, because I am
the recipient of an even
greater award. The Senate
of the great commonwealth
of Missouri passed
and officially inscribed for
me and my posterity a
resolution commending
me for a piece which
appeared in the newspapers
during the final week
of May.
In that column I commended
the fine spirit of
independence displayed by
the citizens of McDonald
County, Mo., because of a
slight imposed upon their
three cities by a State Department
which published
literature describing Missouri's
major points of interest.
Under the forthright
leadership of the state senator
representing McDonald
County, those citizens
announced an intention to
secede from the state and
to establish a commonwealth
within a commonwealth.
The resolution adopted
on June 1 duly notes my
tribute to Missouri's spirit
of 1776, my recognition
of the pride and self-reliance
which still lives in
the very heart of a nation
in which welfarism and
dependence have all but
undermined our national
character, and also discernment
of the fact that
in the true character of
Americans their capacity
to enjoy a joke even at
their expense is undiminished.
All joking aside, through
such demonstrations as
this, Americans are showing
that what our statesmen
at the national level
are hailing in the uprising
of the undeveloped countries
of the world comes
Moley
from principles which we
ourselves believe and
practice.
It happened that in the
early morning after I received
this resolution from
the secretary of the Senate
of Missouri, I traversed
in a taxi the length of Park
Ave. on my way to work
in New York. I saw a
group of men moving
briskly along the sidewalk.
They were some sleepy
newsmen trying to keep
pace with a snappy figure
with gray hair and a face
smiling at the morning
sun. It was no less than
the onetime President of
the United States, a citizen
who comes appropriately
from the city of Independence,
Mo.
It takes real fortitude to
set at defiance the old New
York maxim, "Early to
bed and early to rise, and
don't meet any prominent
people." But Harry S.
Truman is able to do this
even in the very heart
of decadence and luxury.
We may and should criticize
his vicious jibes at
"plutocracy" and Republicanism,
we may question
his taste in language. We
may also attack his lack
of consistency in his insistence
upon a homespun
philosophy while he partakes
of the publishers'
shillings. But no one who
knows the meaning of two-
party politics can question
his conviction that the role
of a political opponent is
to attack the opposition.
