The Controversy Over
Federal Aid to Schools
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are partisans who
will exploit to the full the
embarrassment of Presi-
dent Kennedy because of
the attack of Roman Cath-
olic prelates on his plan
for federal aid to public
schools.
That is unfortunate, be-
cause any President, Cath-
olic or Protestant, who ad-
vocated federal aid of that
sort would be subject to
the same criticism. More-
over, to look at the matter
merely in its political as-
pects is to miss the pro-
foundly important issue
involved.
The point is that dis-
crimination of some kind
begins whenever the fed-
eral government enters a
field hitherto occupied by
the states and local com-
munities.
I would hope that Fran-
cis Cardinal Spellman
would make his objection
on the broad ground that
federal aid to education it-
self is a danger to freedom
generally, rather than to
limit his objections to the
fact that the federal funds
involved are to be given
only to public schools and
the students enrolled
therein.
That broader basis of
argument was made in
very forthright terms by
the late Cardinal O'Hara
of Philadelphia when Pres-
ident Eisenhower advocat-
ed federal school aid. Per-
haps the most vigorous
Catholic opponent of fed-
eral aid at the moment is
the Very Rev. John A.
Flynn, president of St.
John's University in
Queens, New York City.
He puts the issue
squarely on the line, say-
ing that the idea that the
job of education cannot be
done by existing institu-
tions is a myth promulgat-
ed "by the greatest lobby
in the United States - the
school teaching lobby."
Msgr. Flynn then points
to the greatest weakness
of the drive for federal
money for schools. If
school administrators and
teachers would experi-
ment with lengthening the
school day and shortening
vacations, the problems of
inadequate facilities and
an insufficient number of
teachers would be solved.
Nevertheless, there is
solid sense in what Cardi-
nal Spellman says. The
most recent plan for fed-
eral aid, drawn up by the
Kennedy task force head-
ed by Dr. Frederick
Hovde, would, among oth-
er devices, give money on
a basis of each pupil en-
rolled.
Thus, the government
would say that Johnny,
whose parents choose to
send him to a parochial
school because they be-
lieve he will get a better
education there, will get
no support from taxpay-
ers' money despite the
fact that his parents are
included among those tax-
payers.
Cardinal Spellman puts
it this way:
"It is unthinkable that
any American child be de-
nied federal funds because
his parents choose for him
a God-centered education."
As the argument over
federal aid progresses, we
should note that the in-
crease in the number of
children who attend pri-
vate schools is not solely
because their parents want
them to have religious in-
doctrination. That increase
over the last few years is
more largely due to the
growing dissatisfaction
with the kind of education
that teachers and admin-
istrators are providing in
public schools.
If in private business
one of two competitors
finds that customers are
drifting to the other, the
management sharply asks
itself whether it is provid-
ing good service. But
school administrators do
not act that way. Instead,
they claim that there is
nothing wrong with their
service that more money
won't cure.
If more federal money
will bring only more of
the same, then the waste
will be multiplied.
