Peril of Nuclear Fallout Is Slight
and Test Detection Is Impossible
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The efforts of well-
meaning people to stop nu-
clear testing have agitated
British party controver-
sies and our own govern-
ment for years. The result
was a so-called agreement
to halt tests for an indefi-
nite time.
But so far as Russia is
concerned, the agreement
to stop the tests is worth
nothing, and the fear
about the tests has been
greatly overstressed. In
our well - meaning efforts
we have lost a vital advan-
tage.
President Eisenhower
probably agreed to the mu-
tual agreement to ban tests
because he hoped thereby
to usher in a real disarma-
ment program. And Pres-
ident Kennedy has fol-
lowed the same pattern of
wishful thinking and has
sent Arthur H. Dean to Ge-
neva in the same forlorn
hope.

Some very interesting
advice has been made pub-
lic recently in Chicago, in
statements by one of our
most competent experts in
the field, Francis B. Porzel
of the Armour Research
Foundation of the Illinois
Institute of Technology.
So far as the alarm over
the danger of fallout is con-
cerned and the impossibil-
ity of detecting cheating
by the Soviet, Mr. Porzel
repeats what he said at Ge-
neva three years ago:
"The fallout from all
testing to date is 10,000
times too small to produce
a detectable change in the
human body. Fallout radia-
tion is only 1% of the
natural background radia-
tion â€” the radiation that
we are bombarded by all
of our lives."
*
He notes further that
he, himself, probably ab-
sorbed far more Roentgens
of radiation during month-
ly physical tests, from
chest X-rays, while he was
working some years ago at
Los Alamos than he did
working on the site with
atomic bomb explosions.
Moreover, he makes
clear that an agreement
with the Soviet to stop
tests is absolutely mean-
ingless. Mr. Porzel point-
ed out at Geneva in 1958
that he could completely
contain a one or two kilo-
ton nuclear explosion in
a steel ball 50 feet in diam-
eter with walls only three
inches thick, filled with
graphite and soot. An ex-
plosion in such a contain-
er inside a building would
not be noticed by people
on the sidewalk outside.
Nor would scientists in the
community who might be
watching for the explosion
be aware of it.
Thus, we are unable to
know whether the Rus-
sians are or have been car-
rying on secret testing,
despite the Soviet govern-
ment's promise to cease.
This also shows how diffi-
cult it will be to provide
any means to enforce a
disarmament agreement if
one were made.
The Soviet stalling in
the last three years may
have been an easy way to
gain great advantages in
the arms race. We cannot
afford to lose more time.
As Mr. Porzel points out,
the perfection of the bomb
has reached a point at
which "the potential for
destruction by nuclear
weapons has increased
about one million times
since the first atomic
bombs were dropped on
Japan in 1945."
*
Nothing but our blind
faith in the word of the
Communists and our un-
derestimation of the inten-
tion of the Soviet to make
gains in every possible
way can explain our loss
of time in developing nu-
clear power. It is time to
stop the nonsense in Ge-
neva and begin testing
again. "The way to re-
sume is to resume."
