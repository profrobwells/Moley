New York City politi-
cians, like all their kind
everywhere and in all
campaigns, are at the mo-
ment screaming their ut-
ter devotion to the high-
est standards of ethics and
propriety. One momentous
issue in the Democratic
mayorality primary cam-
paign is whether Mayor
Robert Wagner has per-
mitted excessive charges
on the city for groceries
consumed at the mansion
provided for him by the
city fathers.
The allegation involves
a few thousand dollars,
which, if true, means that
the mayor and his friends
and retainers have been
living high on the steer.
Burghers, even those who
carry home their free fed-
eral food in taxis, are sup-
posed to be indignant.

I am reminded of the
story of a powerful boss
in New York who had been
President Roosevelt's clos-
est adviser and chairman
of the Democratic National
Committee and who, in
building a house in the
suburbs, was the benefi-
ciary of a few old city pav-
ing blocks worth less than
a hundred dollars. When
his nomination for the am-
bassadorship came before
a Senate committee, there
was a great hullabaloo and
he was rejected.
But that boss, the sen-
ators who branded him as
a despoiler of the poor,
Mayor Wagner, and, I may
add, the mayor's father,
the late Sen. Robert Wag-
ner, all participated in an
exercise in using taxpay-

ers' money to enrich land
speculators in every city in
the republic.
For anyone who will put
his mind to the subject
can see that whenever fed-
eral subsidies go into
housing, urban renewal, or
any other sort of munici-
pal development, there is
a tremendous inflation in
land values. And those who
hold land out of use in
slums or in unfarmed ru-
ral property in the vicinity
of the cities are the great-
est beneficiaries.
In New York and other
cities a considerable class
of the newly rich is grow-
ing bigger and richer.
These are the speculators
who are the modern coun-
terparts of the great rich
landed families of yore.
The reason is that,
through lack of imagina-
tion and intelligence in
the laws governing land
taxes and the administra-
tive process of assess-
ments, it has come to be
more profitable to hold
land out of use than to
build and thus contribute
to the comfort of the peo-
ple and the beauty of our
urban communities,
Where does this money
come from which en-
riches those who neither
toil or spin? It comes in
the first place from the
people who pay federal
income taxes and who pay
taxes on houses, building
improvements, and the
factories which provide
jobs. In the second place,
it comes from people who,
disdaining free govern-
ment housing, build their
own homes.
This story is very old
indeed. Many classical
economists in England
put their fingers on this
injustice. In the United
States Henry George ar-
gued powerfully against
it generations ago.

It is, in fact, the most
glaring example of legal-
ized exploitation in all of
our modern civilization.
And it has reached its
apogee in what is hap-
pening now.
The argument for fed-
eral aid for municipal
housing and urban devel-
opment is based upon the
assumption that the prop-
erty tax has been ex-
hausted. Candidate Ken-
nedy claimed this in one
of his debates with candi-
date Nixon.
This claim is not true.
It is the federal income
tax which has reached the
point of exhaustion.
There is plenty of money
in a property tax which
would squeeze the profits
from land speculation.
But at long last a pow-
erful interest is aroused
—the builders of homes
and the developers of ur-
ban property. Numerous
articles in magazines and
trade publications have
pointed out this exploita-
tion.

The major journal of
the housing industry,
House and Home, has
been pounding away at
the subject for a long
time. And most recently a
powerful study on the
subject has been pub-
lished by the Urban Land
Institute, an organization
created by real estate de-
velopers.
This national problem
deserves plenty of airing.
For while this country is
rich enough to help al-
most everybody at home
and in the nations of the
world, it cannot in con-
science provide for those
who amass wealth with-
out production and who
live through legalized ex-
ploitation of those who do
produce.
