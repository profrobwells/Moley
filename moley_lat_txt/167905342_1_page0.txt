Orbiting of Russian Spaceman
Is No Surprise to U.S. Scientists
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those Americans who
have been familiar with
the long history of Rus-
sian scientific study and
experimentation see noth-
ing alarming or-even sur-
prising in the successful
launching of a man into
space. When properly
understood there is no oc-
casion to popular hysteria.
In an interview two
weeks ago in Chicago Dr.
T. Paul Torda not only
predicted what has hap-
pened but explained some
of the reasons why Rus-
sian science has shown
such progress in recent
years.
He pointed out that Rus-
sian scientific progress did
not begin with the triumph
of communism in 1917.
Nor is this progress due
entirely to communism as
a philosophy and a form
of government.
Back at the turn of the
century Czarist Russia was
experimenting with rock-
ets. In 1725 when the Unit-
ed States consisted of a
handful of intrepid pio-
neers concerned with win-
ning a home in the wilder-
ness the Russian Acade-
my of Science was estab-
lished.
The, Soviet has consist-
ently projected heavy
space vehicles into orbit.
The largest has been sev-
en tons. The one in which
the recent space man orbit-
ed the earth weighed five
tons. The heaviest orbited
payload created in the
United States weighed
only one ton.
Dr. Torda has explained
this difference. It is due to
the choice by the Russians
of solid-fuel propellants.
He says, "in solid fuel pro-
pellants there is a limit to
what can be done in pro-
gramming performance.
You can build certain per-
formance characteristics
into solid fuels.. But once
the rocket is fired it must
do exactly as you have
built it. You have no con-
trol over its propulsion
performance.
"When liquid fuels are
used this is not so. By
means of piping and
valves, performance can be
directed from the ground.
American engineers can
stop and start a liquid fuel
rocket while it is in orbit.
We have already done so.
This has certain great ad-
vantages especially when
a man is in the vehi-
cle...."

When it is considered
that the United States
started so late in this field
of science the encouraging
thing is that we are al-
ready only measurably be-
hind in space exploration.
In this connection it is
interesting to note an ear-
lier scientific and engineer-
ing field in which the Unit-
ed States has become out-
standing. Arc welding, one
of the most useful tools
in manufacturing was first,
it is said, created in the
1880s by a Frenchman
named Demeteriens.
In 1887 a Russian named
Bernardos improved on the
French product and re-
ceived patents. His process
was licensed throughout
Europe. During the same
period another Russian,
Slav√≠anoff, and an Amer-
ican in Detroit received
patents for an improved
welding process. When it
came to genuine produc-
tion of the process in all
the aspects in which weld-
ing is used the Americans
forged ahead.
When comparisons are
made between rates of
growth in the two coun-
tries, Russia and the Unit-
ed States, it is well to note
how fast the United State
has been gaining on its
great competitor in scien-
tific progress.
