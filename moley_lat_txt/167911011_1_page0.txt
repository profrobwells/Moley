Why Was Force Used in Katanga?
The death of Dag Ham-
marskjold quite properly
elicits the sympathy and
sorrow of the free world.
He was heading an opera-
tion in which he, however
mistakenly, was in the line
of duty.
There is also the peril to
the United Nations itself
involved in choosing his
successor.
But the U.N. hostilities
against the province of
Katanga may also have re-
percussions which might
lose a large part of Africa
to communism. The Amer-
ican people deserve, as do
the peoples of all our
friends in the cold war, an
explanation of this strange
use of a force dedicated to
freedom and independ-
ence.
Sen. Thomas Dodd has
contributed mightily to
such an understanding by
three speeches before the
Senate this month, the last
and most informative one
only hours before the
Hammarskjold crash.
*
His sentiments on that
occasion were heartily
supported by Sens. Keat-
ing, Thurmond and Yar-
borough. The facts he
presented I have checked
and supplemented from
other, direct sources.
The province of Katanga
differs materially from the
rest of the Congo. It is
vastly more civilized in
the Western sense than
the immense valley of the
Congo River to the north
and west. It is more tem-
perate in climate, richer
in resources, and more in
political sympathy with
the Western nations.
President Tshombe is a
man of substance, strongly
anti-Communist, and dedi-
cated to the idea that
while his province should
be governed by the native
black population, it seeks
development by a friendly
relationship with Western-
ers. He opposed the late
Patrice Lumumba on the
ground of that man's well-
demonstrated sympathy
for and associations with
communism.
After sincere efforts to
help create a truly feder-
ated Congo, Tshombe
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
withdrew to Katanga and
succeeded in establishing
measurable order and
peace among its tribes.
In the disorders which
have racked the Congo,
which the United Nations
ostensibly decided to re-
solve, Katanga made no
Dodd
hostile moves against its
neighbors. It simply want-
ed to be either semi-inde-
pendent in a federation or,
if that proved impossible,
to be an independent na-
tion. Its size and progress
toward civilized order cer-
tainly justifies such a
status far beyond most of
the other new African na-
tions.
For the maintenance of
order in Katanga, Tshom-
be developed a consider-
able army. In its ostensible
role of peacemaker, the
United Nations pledged it-
self to place only a small
token force in Katanga. To
this Tshombe agreed.
*
Meanwhile, the so-called
coalition government of
the "republic" of the Congo
took on an unfortunate
hue. Sen. Dodd stated that
the vice premier of that
government, Antoine Gi-
zenga, is a "Prague-
trained Communist." He
is not only the most im-
portant figure in the coali-
tion government but the
boss of Orientale Province.
The man who holds po-
lice control and also the
minister of justice are Gi-
zenga men. And in the
current attack upon Ka-
tanga, the man selected to
govern that province has
been one Bochely-David-
son, who, according to Sen.
Dodd, is "an agent of the
Communist secret police."
Sen. Dodd's assertion is
that, while he cannot pro-
duce Communist cards for
Gizenga's real and pro-
spective appointees, "it
would be sheer lunacy to
assume that a trained
Communist would desig-
nate anti-Communists or
neutrals to key govern-
ment positions."
Another great cause of
apprehension and resent-
ment is the presence in the
U.N. forces of a large con-
tingent of Nehru's Indian
soldiers. For it is feared
in Katanga that Nehru is
eagerly eyeing these
sparcely populated but
rich regions as a place to
send some of his surplus
population.
It should be remem-
hered that these merce-
nary Indian warriors are
of a different race, a differ-
ent religion, and a differ-
ent ideology from the peo-
ple of Katanga. Thus the
U.N. force-for-peace is
highly suspect in Katanga.
The Irish contingent is not
so feared.
*
And so, systematically,
the U.N. forces have
turned the major part of
their attack against Katan-
ga. Of the 20,000 U.N.
troops in the Congo, 14,-
000 have been moved into
Katanga, and only 2,000
into Gizenga's Orientale
Province.
The demand of Sen.
Dodd is that a select Sen-
ate committee get at and
reveal all the facts about
this U.N. enterprise.
That the United States
has responsibility is be-
yond question. We are
contributing half of the
costs of the affair. And
the State Department con-
firmed its support on Sept.
14.
If the Gizenga people
prevail all over the Con-
go, there is an immediate
danger that much of Afri-
ca will succumb to commu-
nism.
It was not without point
that Sen. Dodd drew a par-
allel with the struggle of
the American colonies for
independence in 1776.
