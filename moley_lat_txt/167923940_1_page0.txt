Liberals Aren't Knaves, Just Naive
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
For some years I have
been trying to understand
people who in these times
call themselves liberal.
These are in a majority
in both houses of Congress.
They are numerous in the
administration. They
write copiously in our
press. And they teach in
large numbers in our col-
leges and universities.
The American people, a
singularly gullible lot,
elect a goodly number of
those liberals to public
office.

Back in 1890 they were
almost on the verge of
electing William Jennings
Bryan President because
he said he could make
everybody rich by creat-
ing more currency. And at
the present time this elec-
torate has given liberals
a mandate to experiment
on the nation and its in-
stitutions with taxpayers'
money.
Some conservatives con-
demn liberals on moral
grounds. I cannot agree
with that. Liberals are not
knaves. They are naive.
They are not delinquent.
They are deluded. They
are not wicked but wit-
less.
True, there are some
rascals who join the
liberals in their nonsense
not because they believe
in the stuff, but because
they can get votes and jobs
that way. But these are
exceptions.

The liberals are not
socialistic. Because even
they know that socialism
was the delusion of anoth-
er naive generation.
They are not pro-Com-
munist. They merely be-
lieve that communism can
be destroyed by kindness,
money and appeasement.
The liberal is really a
very sensitive fellow. His
antennae vibrate violently
with every ill in the broad
land. His imagination
teems with solutions. In
Moley.
fact, as it has been said of
one senator, he has more
solutions than there are
problems.

In the past session liber-
als introduced a bill to cre-
ate an advisory committee
on the fine arts. Surely the
arts are fine things. And
some of them have fancy
names.
The other evening dur-
ing a stroll I noticed that
the Guggenheim Museum
was showing something
called "abstra
impres-
sionist, imagists." I won-
dered what Solomon F.
Guggenheim would have
said about spending his
millions for that. But it
was his money, not the
taxpayers!
Somehow, however, the
liberals in Congress want-
ed to get the f leral gov-
ernment into the imagists'
act. But they apparently
decided they need not wait
for an advisory committee.
They introduced a bill to
set up a portrait gallery in
the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. And then that keeper
of the conscience and sani-
ty of the House, the Rules
Committee, felt that Mr.
Mellon had attended to the
arts in Washington, and it
shelved these bills.
But these excursions in-
to the arts were the ex-
ceptions. The liberals have
an affinity for economic so-
lutions.
I offer one example
among many. For years, in
prosperity and recession
alike, liberals have been
worried about "pockets of
unemployment." And so
bill No. 1 this year was for
the relief of "depressed
areas." It was passed as a
great humanitarian meas-
ure and hailed as a proof
that the New Frontier
was "getting moving." The
bill was passed and signed
six months ago.
Then the problem was
dumped upon a newly cre-
ated bureaucracy. Appar-
ently the solution was not
so easy to find, not even
with an appropriation of
$400 million. Since even
bureaucrats must keep
some sort of order, they
have been unable to
find among the great num-
ber of demands for help-
mostly from communities
that need no help at all—
practical projects for the
use of the money.
★
One community merely
asked for a new jail. But
the bureaucrats will no
doubt find ways to spend
the money, even if they
have to spend it on hiring
people to study the prob-
lem.
This illustrates the way
liberalism works. It is not
concerned with practical
problems. It is concerned
with passing laws and
spending money. It passes
a declaration of a good in-
tention.
Probably areas will re-
main depressed until eco-
nomic law and common
sense make people do what
our forefathers did. Move!
And if greener pastures
appear, move again. For
economic laws and com-
mon sense are not created
by government. Nor can
they be repealed by Con-
gress.
The liberals have a cost-
ly way to run a govern-
ment. But it is going to be
that way until a tax-bur-
dened electorate is more
careful about the people it
chooses to run things.
