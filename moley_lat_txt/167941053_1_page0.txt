Sam Rayburn Wanted
No Rasputins Around
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In 1933, during the
weeks when President-
elect Roosevelt was select-
ing his Cabinet and plan-
ning his policies, I once
found myself sitting with
Sam Rayburn in a dining
car on the way from Warm
Springs to Washington.
In our discussion of what
was likely to happen in the
new administration Ray-
burn paused and, with his
characteristic caution,
peered behind him and
across the car to see if
anyone was within ear-
shot. Then he said in a low
voice, "I hope there won't
be any durned Rasputins
around the White House."
I was startled, because I
was destined to be a
handyman there myself.
But Sam's kindly look dis-
pelled that concern. It ap-
peared that he was refer-
ring to Louis Howe, who
had faithfully served Mr.
Roosevelt for years and
was to be his secretary.
Louis loved the role of
mystery man.

Rayburn well remem-
bered the resentment in
Congress during the Wil-
son administration be-
cause of the influence of
Col. House. He wanted no
more of that.
But there was a basic
Constitutional tradition be-
hind Rayburn's remark—
a lesson I have never for-
gotten. He had at that time
already served 20 years
and voters had repeatedly
given him a mandate. He
wanted no mere ap-
pointees or friends of the
President to lurk in the
highway to the White
House.
Ten years before the
election of Rayburn in his
Northeastern Texas dis-
trict, John Nance Garner
had been elected in West
Texas. Garner was a vet-
eran when Rayburn was a
freshman. In some respects
he overshadowed Ray-
burn.
Garner was also more
aggressive. More spectacu-
lar and much more con-
servative. While he served
as Vice President, he open-
ly opposed much of the
New Deal.
Rayburn was more cau-
tious in his relations with
Presidents, seven of whom
he saw come and go be-
fore the coming of the
present incumbent.
As majority leader and
later as speaker, he sel-
dom disagreed openly
with a President. But
when he felt that some
measure recommended by
a President was unsound,
he told him, "Mr. Presi-
dent, I just can't get the
votes for you on that."
That usually settled the
matter.
It is absurd to say, as
some commentators have
written since the speak-
er's illness, that in the
scramble for the Vice
Presidency in 1944 Ray-
burn had no ambitions for
that nomination. He want-
ed it because he believed,
as did every other aspir-
ant that year, that Mr.
Roosevelt could not live
out another term.
Our meeting in 1933 to
which I have referred was
the beginning of a long
friendship which was
marred by no exchange of
favors. The only time
Rayburn asked anything
of me was when, as a can-
didate for promotion from
the chairmanship of the
Interstate Commerce
Committee to the majority
leadership, he suggested
that I ask President
Roosevelt to help.
I did so and received
from F.D.R. in reply an
eloquent speech about the
necessity that the Presi-
dent keep hands off the
decisions of Congress.

That speech, comment-
ed Rayburn sadly when I
told him, was "for the
birds." His judgment was
proved later when, in the
famous "Dear Alben" let-
ter, the President openly
boosted Sen. Barkley into
the Senate majority lead-
ership.
But after an interim
Rayburn attained the ma-
jority leadership and later
the speakership without
Presidential help. His ob-
ligations remained only to
his colleagues in the
House.
When Rayburn left
Washington this year,
something was lost in the
traditions of the House—
something created by his
respect for the preroga-
tives of Congress, his sage
advice to new members,
his patience with unrea-
soning zealots who are so
often thrown into office in
congressional races, and
his long-standing respect
for the rights of veteran
chairmen of House com-
mittees.
