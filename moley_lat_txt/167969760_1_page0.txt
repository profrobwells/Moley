The Welch Attack on Pasternak
Is a Blow Against Individuality
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A good many people who
used to believe that Robert
H. W. Welch Jr. was at
least familiar with communism were turned from
him and his John Birch
Society when among his
scattered targets he included Boris Pasternak,
author of the renowned
novel, "Doctor Zhivago."
As was well known at
the time of its publication
the author was, on pain of
expulsion from his native
land, compelled to renounce the Nobel Prize.
Pasternak himself was denounced by the Kremlin,
and his book was banned
in Russia. But according
to Welch, the Pasternak
affair was "planned" in
Moscow to boost circulation: "We're the suckers
falling for it," and anyone
with a good word for the
novel must be "soft in the
head."
*
When the Russian revolution occurred, Pasternak,
already an esteemed poet,
hoped that some good
might come of it.
He soon found that there
was no place for his views
of the importance of the
individual, spiritual freedom, and untrammeled
creativity. He was never
a comrade in coterie with
the authors who have
spread a blight over Russian literature for more
than 40 years.
Under attack by Soviet
literary hacks but unable
to tear himself away from
his people and homeland,
Pasternak turned his enormous, burning talent to
the translation of great
western authors, including
Shakespeare and Goethe.
He adhered to his "doctrine of individuality and
freedom," at times assuming grave personal risk.
When he decided to write
"Doctor Zhivago" It was
by compulsion: "I said to
myself, you must stand up
straight before your own
name."
★
There was a brief thaw
in official attitudes toward
creative work between
Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin and the Hungarian Revolution which
gave him hope that his
novel might be published
in Russia. While it was
never put into page proofs
in the Soviet Union, it
came off the presses in
Italy despite attempts to
stop publication.
"Doctor Zhivago" was
denounced and Pasternak
excoriated in vile terms.
Why? Because Pasternak
had constructed a monumental indictment of Soviet
history. Through Yuri
Zhivago and other characters of the novel, Pasternak revealed his own
devotion to principles of
life, liberty, and individual expression and his contempt for tyranny and for
conformity by governmental ukase.
★
Of Marxism, Zhivago
says: "I don't know a
movement more self-centered and further removed
from the facts than Marxism. Everyone is worried
only about proving himself
in practical matters, and
as for the men in power,
they are so anxious to establish the myth of their
infallibility that they do
their utmost to ignore the
truth."
Soviet leaders could not
forgive the following statement by one of Zhivago's
friends in the epilogue
which underlines the colossal lie the Russian people
have been forced to
live: "I think that collectivization was an erroneous
and unsuccessful measure
and it was impossible to
admit that error. To conceal the failure people had
to be cured, by every
means of terrorism, of the
habit of thinking and
judging for themselves...
This accounts for unexampled cruelty... the promulgation of a constitution
that was never meant
to be applied, and the introduction of elections that
violated the very principles of free choice."
But Pasternak's novel is
not a mere repudiation of a
system. It is a tribute to
the indomitable qualities
of men — in this case individuals with spiritual
and moral virtues who
have survived, with their
principles strengthened,
the almost overwhelming
military, political, and social forces that swept
across Russia like a malevolent storm.
*
These qualities have not
been confined to certain
peoples or to certain times.
They are common to mankind. They were to be
found in ancient civilizations and in the provinces
of imperial Rome. They
have survived every tyranny.
Pasternak speaks out for
the individual, not the
state or an organization
that would force the individual to rigid conformity. That is why Soviet rulers smothered the publication of "Doctor Zhivago."
And the conformity desired by Mr. Welch's John
Birch Society would itself
certainly be a denial of the
universal principles "Doctor Zhivago" extolls.
