Nixon Still Big Asset
to GOP and the Nation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is of great importance
that the people over the
nation understand the
very special problems of
California and the trying
months through which
Richard Nixon has gone
in deciding whether or not
to run for governor of his
state. For millions of our
citizens supported and
voted for him in 1960 and
have a deep interest in
his future as party leader.
All through these
months, which have been
a terrific ordeal for Nixon,
it has been easy for Re-
publicans and others to ad-
vise him at a distance of
3,000 miles. Some of that
advice has been dictated
not by Nixon's interest
but the interest of those
who have given it so in-
considerately and gratui-
tously.
A few would like to
have him out of the way
as a Presidential possibil-
ity in order that their own
fortunes might be pros-
pered. Others, devoted to
him, have believed that he
must hold a public office
in order that he keep his
name before the public as
a contender for the Presi-
dential nomination in
1964.

But none of the kibit-
zers have considered the
torturing public and pri-
vate decision he has had
to make.
Personal and family
considerations may be put
aside. Nixon can earn a
living regardless of his
course. But a man in his
position belongs in a sense
to his party and his pub-
lic supporters. He is a dis-
tinct asset to the party
and the nation.
His value has accrued
through his public service
in the House, the Senate,
in the Vice Presidency,
and as the candidate of
his party for the Presi-
dency. He has lived close
to the heartbeat of great
affairs. Thus he has
knowledge and experi-
ence of inestimable conse-
quence.
It is true that in large
measure he has earned
these himself. But also
they have been given to
him by the voters who
have supported him.
A major obligation is
owed to his party. The
ideological position of Nix-
on is somewhere between
those of Gov. Rockefeller
and Sen. Goldwater. In a
conflict between the two
elements in the party rep-
resented by those leaders,
the party must select a
middle ground. If there
were no Nixon, there
would be need to invent
oneâ€”or find a personality
now invisible, a personal-
ity who would have to be
brought into national
prominence.
Nixon also has a deep
obligation to California. It
has accorded him many
votes of confidence.
There was also the con-
sideration that in running
for governor, Nixon would
have to contend with im-
mense opposition within
the state and from else-
where. For the Democrat-
ic administration could
not help but be anxious to
terminate his career now
rather than fight him in
1964.

Nixon is not a rich man
as Stevenson was after
his 1952 defeat, nor as
Rockefeller and Goldwa-
ter are now. He must, in
addition to meeting his
public obligations, earn
his own living.
Finally, he has had to
realize that in the nation-
al and international crises
which the nation faces, his
experience has so largely
been in the very meat of
those latter matters. Free
government needs a
strong two-party system.
And the role of the oppo-
sition involves informed
and experienced criticism.
In whatever position Nix-
on may occupy, this will
be a major task for him.
