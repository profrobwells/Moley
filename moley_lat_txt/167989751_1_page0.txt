Extreme Left, Right
Put Squeeze on Middle
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Is there any such thing
as the "happy" medium?
Not if history teaches any-
thing. For those who have
chosen a middle ground in
politics or religion have
always been made most
unhappy by their lunatic
fringes.
Radicalism begets radi-
calism at the other end of
the spectrum. And ulti-
mately the unhappiness
and sometimes the blood
that is shed is that of peo-
ple who would have
chosen to live with their
neighbors in peace.
I doubt that when the
reformation swept Europe
at the end of the Middle
Ages the great majority
of the people there wanted
any trouble. But religious
wars drenched Europe
with blood. And most of
the blood was that of peo-
ple who would have
chosen tolerance.
The United States
drifted needlessly into the
Civil War amid the clamor
of extremists.
The present eruption of
controversy over what is
called the extreme right
will not end in blood-let-
ting. But it certainly does
embarrass those who seek
to draw a distinction be-
tween the policies sup-
ported, say, by President
Kennedy on the one hand
and by former President
Eisenhower and Richard
Nixon on the other. I am
confident that perhaps
90% of the American peo-
ple would solve the mat-
ter by the rational proc-
esses of political action.
What I regard as true
conservatism is a belief
that this country is rich
enough to provide many
social services and also to
maintain an adequate de-
fense. But it holds that
when benefits are be-
stowed without discrimi-
nation and government
spends without responsi-
bility, the integrity of our
economy and the liberty
of our citizens are unduly
constricted.

Moreover, the true con-
servative regards the
clamor of the extreme
right as a peril to his
cause, just as the true lib-
eral is annoyed by those
who would imperil our in-
stitutions by excessive
government intervention
and the appeasement of
communism.
The mischief arises
when politicians seize
upon these extremes to
create the impression that
all dissent is extreme. In
his recent speech in Los
Angeles President Ken-
nedy, whether he realized
it or not, was following in
the footsteps of his distin-
guished predecessor,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
At the time when the
early New Deal reforms
were enacted—reforms
which were remedial and
not at all dangerous—
there was created what
was known as the Liberty
League. In 1936, when the
Republican Party was so
weak that it was hardly
regarded as opposition by
Mr. Roosevelt, the Presi-
dent concentrated his at-
tack upon the Liberty
League and its members.
It was unfortunate be-
cause it created a great
hue and cry against all
business.
