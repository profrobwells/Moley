Union Payola for Political Piper
President Kennedy has
appointed a commission to
study and report upon the
financing of Presidential
elections. Considering the
excellent qualifications of
some of the people appointed,
this can be and may
be a revealing and important
investigation.
But it cannot stop at the
remedy mentioned by the
President, which is to pay
the costs of such campaigns
with money contributed by
the federal government. This
would follow the well-worn
pattern of the New Frontier
for the solution of all national
problems â€” more
federal handouts.
It may be that federal
support of campaigns
would be a workable remedy.
But it could not meet the
practical problems involved
unless thorough and impartial
remedies are put into effect to
correct or eliminate some of
the current practices.
A good deal of legislation
is already on the books to
publicise, prohibit or limit
spending by the "special
interests" mentioned by the
President in his directive to
the new commission.
But much of it is either
unenforced or unenforceable.
Reports of direct contributions
and expenditures are required,
but these fall far short of the
actual spending which indirectly
contributes to campaigns.
Under laws passed in
1907 and amended in 1947
in the Taft-Hartley legislation,
corporations as well as labor
organizations are prohibited
from making "a contribution or
expenditure in connection with
any election in any (federal)
political office, or in connection
with any primary election or
political convention or caucus held
to select candidates."
The background of this
legislation was reviewed
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
exhaustively in 1957 in an
opinion of the Supreme
Court written by Justice
Frankfurter. That opinion
reinstated an indictment
against the UAW. The
case was subsequently tried
in a federal court in Michigan
and resulted in an acquittal on
the specific offense charged.
Since then the law, so far as
labor unions are concerned,
has been substantially a dead
letter.
It has remained a common
practice for labor unions to
make political expenditures of
various sorts out of their general
funds, which are made up of dues
paid by all members.
In a more recent case
(the Looper case) the issue
was brought before the Supreme
Court in connection with railway
labor organizations. Here the law
rested upon the fact that union
membership is compulsory and dues
are mandatory.
In very strong language,
even Justices Brennan, Black
and Douglas, pronounced liberals,
asserted the injustice of using the
dues money of members who oppose
the candidates and party supported
by the union. As Justice Black
said, "If this is constitutional, the
First Amendment is not the
charter of political and religious
liberty its sponsors believed it to
be."
The issue of union contributions
involves not only the injustice to
dues-paying union members but,
as Justice Frankfurter said in the
UAW case, a threat to the electoral
system. For the funds available
to the unions are so large that it
is doubtful whether any contributions
given voluntarily can match them.
Nor without the correction of
this union practice could any system
of federal aid to the parties help
much.
This should have high priority
in the studies by the new Presidential
commission.
After the election of 1956, a
Senate subcommittee under the
chairmanship of Sen. Gore made a
study of contributions and issued a
report which provided glaring
headlines about huge contributions
by rich families and corporation
executives to the Republican Party.
Little was said about the evil and
injustice involved in union expenditures
from general funds.
The chairman of the new
Kennedy commission, Prof. Alexander
Heard, not only was a major witness
in the Gore study, but later wrote
lightly of the problem of labor union
expenditures.
The personnel of the new commission
includes at least two members, Walter
N. Thayer of New York and James
Worthy of Illinois, who have had wide
experience in raising money for political
campaigns. They are not likely to
overlook the primary problem of labor
union expenditures obtained from
opulent treasuries.
