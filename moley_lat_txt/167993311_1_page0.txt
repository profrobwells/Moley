Will a Wild Irish Row Break Out
Between Kennedy and McCormack?
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Time, circumstance, and
fate have decreed that for
the immediate future the
two most powerful offices
in the United States will
be held by citizens of
Massachusetts. Both in-
cumbents are Democrats
and deeply dedicated and
skillful politicians.
The question in every
informed political mind
is how well the President
and the speaker of the
House of Representatives
will co-operate in pushing
the Kennedy program.
The answer to this ques-
tion cannot rest upon the
verbal assurances of co-
operation from both
sources. For what else
could either say for pub-
lication?
A complete answer may
not be possible until the
acts are completed and the
game is over. But since
the roots of the relation-
ship between the Ken-
nedys and the McCormacks
go back into the personali-
ties and factionalism of
Massachusetts politics, I
have asked for an answer
from an old friend in the
Bay State who, over the
years, has provided me
with most accurate and
wise information about af-
fairs in that complex
commonwealth.
He says that John Mc-
Cormack has always been
a man who has confined
his political operations
largely to the small en-
clave in South Boston
which is his congressional
constituency.
His responsibilities in
Washington have kept him
immersed in national af-
fairs. He is not a gregari-
ous man. A somewhat cold
exterior, however, dis-
creetly veils strong feel-
ings and purposes.

On the other hand, my
correspondent points out
that the ties of John Fitz-
gerald Kennedy with his
state have always been
very thin. Father Joseph
maintained, except on oc-
casions, a considerable
aloofness from the hardy,
turbulent life of Massachu-
setts politics.
John F. Kennedy sought
and obtained a seat in Con-
gress from the 11th Dis-
trict. But as they say in
Massachusetts, he was a
"mattress voter" in that
district — nominally, but
not really, a resident.
John McCormack, on the
other hand, loved his dis-
trict and lived in it except
during his attendance in
Congress.
Paul A. Dever, as gover-
nor and a power in politics,
controlled the Democratic
Party in the state until his
death, when the younger
Kennedys pushed into
control, shoving McCor-
mack aside in the process.
The "other" McCor-
mack is the speaker's
nephew. Since the elder
McCormacks have no chil-
dren, the younger and
highly intelligent and re-
spected Edward McCor-
mack, now attorney gen-
eral of the state, is the
very apple of his uncle's
eye. There is powerful
affection between the two.
In 1956, when John F.
Kennedy aspired to the
Vice Presidential nomina-
tion, there was also a
sharp factional conflict be-
tween the McCormacks
and the Kennedys. While
the picture is not clear,
it is evident that in the
1956 convention fight be-
tween John F. Kennedy
and Estes Kefauver for
the nomination, John Mc-
Cormack was far from an
ardent supporter of the
President-to-be.
In the years following,
things were quiet between
the factions, but it is be-
lieved that McCormack
wanted the appointment
to the Senate seat vacated
by the President-elect to
go to nephew Edward. In-
stead, the appointment
went to Benjamin Smith,
a personal friend of Mr.
Kennedy.
The contest which is
emerging is a really bit-
ter fight for the senatorial
nomination this year be-
tween the two Edwards:
Ed McCormack and Ted
Kennedy. The younger
McCormack will probably
win.

It is hardly necessary to
discuss the degree of fer-
vor with which John Mc-
Cormack will act in the
President's behalf. It is
sufficient to say that, even
if the speaker tries his
best, his power in the
House will be much less
than was Rayburn's.
It is certain that Mc-
Cormack will hold firm to
the traditions and preroga-
tives of the House.
That means that Presi-
dential pressure on mem-
bers will be most circum-
spect. if Messrs. John F.
and Robert Kennedy are
as wise as their experience
should have made them.
For the McCormacks don't
like to be pushed around.
