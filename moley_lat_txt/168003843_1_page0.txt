Conservatism Seeks a Definition
Such questions as
"What is a conservative?
Or a liberal?" would be
countered by a precisionist
by "What century are you
talking about? What gen-
eration? What country?"
As I think of the
changed meaning of those
terms, I am reminded of a
story attributed to Abra-
ham Lincoln. In a dream
he saw two men fighting.
One was clothed in a big
overcoat. As the struggle
proceeded, the coat left
one man and got onto the
other.
Since the origins of the
terms "conservative" and
"liberal" are of mere anti-
quarian interest, it is nec-
essary only to note that a
century ago in Britain the
conservatives were the
lineal descendants of the
Tories who sought the ex-
altation of royal authority.
The liberals rooted their
faith in the protection of
the individual.
The one tended toward
centralized authority, the
other toward keeping offi-
cial authority close to the
people.

Since the good word
"liberal" has now been ap-
propriated by those who
favor greater and greater
centralized government,
those who oppose that
trend have appropriated
the abandoned word "con-
servative." And through
the efforts of Sen. Barry
Goldwater and others the
word has become respect-
able.
Whatever may be its
origins, if it means an al-
ternative to the point of
view of the current liberal-
ism, it may as well be ac-
cepted.
It is a matter of concern,
however, that so many
conservatives, especially
the young people who have
adopted that faith, have
provided for themselves no
specific meaning for what

they believe. They fail to
show how they would ap-
ply their philosophy to
the problems before us on
the present scene.
They cannot prevail if
they are merely opponents
of what is going on in
Washington, in the col-
lege classrooms, and in the
liberal press. Mere oppo-
sition may be enough for
a political party, but it is

not a positive philosophy
acceptable to millions of
people.
Nor can conservatives
make a personality-even
so worthy as the late Sen.
Taft or the immensely val-
uable Sen. Goldwaterâ€”
suffice as a rallying point.
They must themselves
have a central set of prin-
ciples against which they
can measure those who of-
fer themselves as candi-
dates for office.
To attempt a definition
in this space would be to
oversimplify their prob-
lem. That would take a
book.

But it may be helpful
to remind conservatives
that their faith is rooted in
a revolutionary idea: The
real revolution in modern
times is the concept of the
individual as the center
and root of authority. Not
the individual for whom
things must be done, but
the individual who must,
so far as possible, do
things for himself.
This is the basic idea
launched by Adam Smith
in. his concept of indi-
vidual enterprise in eco-
nomics. It is the political
concept carried over from
the Glorious Revolution
of 1688 and John Locke
into Jefferson's Declara-
tion of Independence.
The various agencies of
government which have
grown up around the indi-
vidual are his servants,
subject to his direction and
designed to serve his
needs.
To render him safe from
the tyranny of any of
those governmental units,
constitutional protections
and limitations were de-
vised. And in America the
federal system was de-
signed to keep authority
as close as possible to the
individual, subject to his
surveillance and control at
all times.
In that plan of decen-
tralization lies his assur-
ance of liberty and growth
and self-reliance. The
more distant the agencies
of government, his serv-
ants, are from him, the
greater danger to him,
from a bureaucracy which
must inevitably become a
selfish interest in itself
and for itself.
For example, the wel-
fare community should
never be supplanted by
the welfare state. Self-
regulation in business
should never lag, or there
will be regulation by a
super-government.
To build upon this foun-
dation is the task of the
new conservatism. This
country is rich enough to
meet the needs of those
who cannot help them-
selves. But it cannot be
rich enough to afford a
super-government in any
sense of the word.
