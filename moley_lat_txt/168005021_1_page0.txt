In the Spirit of a True
Revolt for Freedom
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It is a matter of great
significance that there ap-
peared within the space of
a few days the "Mater et
Magistra" of Pope John
XXII and the Soviet Un-
ion's program for com-
munism. For in these two
documents there is vividly
portrayed the abyss be-
tween the gross ma-
terialism of Marx-Lenin-
Khrushchev and the free
world.
Divisions among our-
selves over church doc-
trine need not impair our
appreciation of the con-
trast. For in its essence
the encyclical is an amal-
gam of basic Christianity
and the slowly evolved
methods of progress and
political freedom of the
Western World.
It is in the spirit of the
true revolution of modern
times. The Communist
plan is a counter-revolu-
tion in which the individ-
ual is utterly subordinat-
ed to the state.
*
In my appraisal of the
two documents I am limit-
ing myself to a considera-
tion of the political faith
behind free institutions.
That faith, as I see it, em-
bodies first the concept of
the paramount individual,
with the state as his serv-
ant.
Further, the concept
that the individual has es-
sential and everlasting
worth. Next, that the good
life is something more
than the goods of life. And,
finally, that the individ-
ual, not the state, shall
determine the components
which make up the good
life.
"Mater et Magistra"
emphasizes those prin-
ciples. The authority of
government must be re-
stricted by the observance
of "the right that individ-
ual persons possess of al-
ways being primarily re-
sponsible for their own up-
keep and that of their own
family." But they may
"join together to attain ob-
jectives which are beyond
the capacity and means at
the disposal of single in-
dividuals."
To comprehend the po-
litical society in which
these principles are recog-
nized, it is necessary to
trace their course in the
long perspective of his-
tory.
Neither Christianity nor
the Christian churches
originated the concept of
the individual with a soul,
who seeks union with god.
That came to Christianity
from the Judaic tradition
â€”the source, incidentally,
from which Mohammed
drew his inspiration and
built his own faith.
The modern concept of
Moley
the relation of the citizen
and the state came from
the Greeks.
This is abundantly
shown in Aristotle's "Eth-
ics." For in that great
seminal work Aristotle
defined the individual's
concept of "the good we
are seeking." He called
this good "happiness." It
was a composite of many
values:
"Now such a thing hap-
piness, above all else, is
held to be; for this we
choose always for itself
and never for the sake of
something else, but hon-
or, pleasure, reason, and
every virtue we choose in-
deed for themselves, but
the sake of happiness . . .
Happiness, then, is some-
thing final and self suffi-
cient, and is the end of ac-
tion."
*
The key word here is
"choose," clearly meaning
that there be freedom of
choice among the various
values which in sum
amount to happiness.
When Jefferson wrote
the Declaration of Inde-
pendence he revised John
Locke's trilogy of the
rights of man. "Life, Lib-
erty, and Property," to be
"life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness." It is
my opinion that the change
came from Jefferson's ex-
tensive study of the clas-
sics, especially Aristotle.
