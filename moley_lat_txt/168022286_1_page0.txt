Nation's Economic IIIs Were Cured
Without Kennedy's Medicine Men
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The President and his
assorted economic wizards
and seers find themselves,
after a year, caught in the
onrush of forces which
they themselves promised
to create.
They find that it is al-
most as embarrassing to
be caught in the onrush of
a boom as it is to start an
administration in the on-
set of a depression. After
nearly three decades, dur-
ing which liberals have
claimed that economic
forces could be manipulat-
ed by the acts of Con-
gress, a virile economy
has again asserted its
primacy.
★
As we well remember,
the 1960 campaign slogan
was "Let's get moving."
Well, a lot of people other
than Candidate Kennedy
had that idea, but for en-
tirely different reasons.
His was an appeal for
votes; theirs was a re-
sponse to economic needs.
The recession, which
was so actively exploited
by the New Frontier, was
already on its way out
when the new President
was inaugurated. The
economy couldn't afford to
wait until the various pre-
scriptions for economic
nostrums could be filled at
the congressional drug-
store.
And now the major is-
sue on which the Kennedy
campaign was planned is
as outdated as a 1960 alma-
nac.
In another respect the
President is caught in the
backwash of his own prop-
aganda. He and his inner
circle were promising a
year ago a new adminis-
tration which would be
like the first months of
the Roosevelt regime in
1933. Fast thinking, a
spate of new proposals,
and immediate action by
Congress characterized
the hundred days' session
which ended in June of
that year.
These present showmen,
despite their appropriation
of the word "new," are
not new at all. They prom-
ised merely a reshowing
of an old film.
They lost sight of the
future in looking to the
past. Despite their claim
to being progressive, they
were reactionary.
★
What they failed to real-
ize was that at least three
elements that contributed
to Roosevelt's success
were missing in 1961.
In the first place, there
was no depression as in
the dark February and
March, 1933. When 1961
dawned, business was al-
ready on the upturn from
non-governmental forces.
A second defect in the
Kennedy insight and hind-
sight was that the meas-
ures he proposed were
quite the opposite of those
which sparked the begin-
ning of the 1933 recovery
after Roosevelt was in-
augurated. Those meas-
ures were the restoration
of confidence in the banks
and steps to strengthen
them against another pan-
ic.
And while Roosevelt's
second major recommen-
dation was drastic econo-
my in government spend-
ing, the Kennedy propos-
als would have involved
massive new spending.
★
A third and most im-
portant factor in the fail-
ure of Congress to respond
in 1961 as it did in 1933
was the lack of a clear
Kennedy mandate from
the electorate. Roosevelt
had been elected over Hoo-
ver by more than 7 mil-
lion votes; Kennedy over
Nixon by 118,263.
Instead of a Congress
with the solid majority
elected along with Roose-
velt, the personnel of the
Congress which assembled
in 1961 was largely a hold-
over from earlier elections.
Responsiveness to Presi-
dential dictates could not
have been expected from
a Congress which owed
only a slight debt to the
slim victory of the Presi-
dent.
In the present session of
Congress that same imped-
iment will appear.
It is quite probable that
President Kennedy real-
ized that 1961 was not 1933
early in his first year. He
admitted to more than one
individual that his heart
was not set on the enact-
ment of domestic reforms.
And so he somewhat
perfunctorily sent a num-
ber of recommendations to
Congress to fulfill his cam-
paign promises to a num-
ber of pressure groups and
then turned his major at-
tention to foreign affairs.
High on the agenda this
year will be tariff reform.
President Kennedy might
well review his history on
that point. It was the one
major issue that President
Roosevelt ducked. He de-
cided not to press Con-
gress to enact a reciprocal
trade act in June, 1933,
amid the wailing and pro-
testing of Secretary of
State Hull.
It was, F.D.R. believed,
too hot and too complicat-
ed to touch. Also, he was
concerned wholly in the
recovery of the American
economy and refused to
tamper with an issue
which might halt the be-
ginnings of recovery.
★
Finally, it is a mistake
to measure the success of
an administration and Con-
gress by the number of
bills enacted. That sort of
measurement of achieve-
ment becomes a sort of
sporting calculation, like a
batting average or the
number of completed pass-
es in football.
