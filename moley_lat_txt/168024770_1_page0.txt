Gutter Politics Are Still With Us
A rough, windy prima-
ry campaign in New York
City has ended. The re-
sults, published over the
nation, are not relevant
to the purpose of this ar-
ticle. Our abiding interest
should be the low level
which political campaign-
ing in this country so of-
ten reaches.
In the final days of the
campaign an issue arose
which is never absent
from any campaign, espe-
cially when there is little
choice among candidates
on any pertinent ground.
It is the issue of religious
and racial prejudice, des-
ignated in headlines-be-
cause it is a short word-
as "bias."
*
Arthur Levitt, state
controller and candidate
for the Democratic nom-
ination for mayor, accord-
ing to the press, charged
that Mayor Robert Wag-
ner, also a candidate, per-
mitted some of his chief-
tains to circulate an anti-
Semitic attack against
Levitt. This is called the
"smear direct."
Then it was charged by
some of Wagner's people
that some of Levitt's peo-
ple had manufactured the
defamatory litera-
ture against Levitt to af-
ford the charge of bigotry
against Wagner. That is
called the "smear indi-
rect."
Thus the variations on
the theme are many and
diverse.
Of course, everyone de-
plores an appeal to racial
or religious preju-
dice. And in some places
everyone uses it.
I well remember the cri-
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
sis of a campaign for may-
or in New York in 1933.
Fiorello La Guardia, who
proved to be a good may-
or but could play the dem-
agogue with the best of
his time, charged that Jo-
seph McKee, who was
running as an anti-Tam-
many Democrat, had writ-
ten an essay in his school
Moley
days casting aspersions
upon Italian and Jewish
boys.
Since the Little Flower
was both Italian and Jew-
ish, it was a deadly weap-
on in his capable hands.
*
I was present when Mc-
Kee's managers were dis-
cussing ways to meet the
attack. After some discus-
sion, a member of the
group, who could have
made a fortune in Holly-
wood portraying the po-
litical hack, said: "Let's
start a 'whispering' cam-
paign."
I never knew whether
his advice was taken. But
if so, it was unavailing.
La Guardia was elected.
The two parties in New
York are meticulous in
embracing all races and re-
ligions. In the old days
the city-wide ticket was
generally composed of a
Catholic, a Jew and a
Protestant. The district at-
torneys for some reason
were always Protestant.
In time, an Italian name
was substituted for that
of a Protestant. Witness
the current Republican
slate: Lefkowitz, Fino and
Gilhooley.
As the Negroes became
politically powerful, one of
that race was nominated
by the Democrats for
president of the Borough
of Manhattan.
As I have noted, there
are many varieties of the
"bias" smear. When there
is no possibility of proof
and it seems impractical
to manufacture one, a can-
didate repeats over and
over, hand on heart, his
right to public office, "un-
der the Constitution of the
United States, despite re-
ligious affiliation."
This casts abroad the
suspicion that his oppo-
nent is indeed opposed to
him on grounds of re-
ligion. It is very effective.
For the opponent cannot
answer that he is really
and truly a friend of all
Americans, etc. That
would get people thinking
that he "protests too
much" and must be guilty.
But the pious dem-
agogue has ignited the fire
of unreason. The damage
is done. For even the most
unworthy and neglectful
of a faith feels a personal
affront at a thrust at his
inherited religion.
*
I once heard a fine old
Catholic bishop say most
forcefully to his congrega-
tion: "You will stand up
for your religion when you
won't kneel down for it."
Meaning that they might
substitute fishing for
church attendance on Sun-
day and miss their Easter
duty. But they neverthe-
less carried religious chips
on their shoulders. They
were always ready for a
fight.
I might conclude by sug-
gesting that all resorts to
religious and racial themes
in politics are reflections
on the intelligence of vot-
ers.
Whoever raises the is-
sue in whatever form,
direct, indirect and by in-
ference should be re-
pudiated. Race and re-
ligion as a qualification for
office should be irrelevant.
But with human nature
what it has been and is
and will be, that ideal can-
not be expected in our
time.
