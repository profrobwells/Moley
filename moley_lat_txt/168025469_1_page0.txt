Kennedy May Fall Into Political
Trap He Set to Catch Negro Votes
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When the President tied
together his proposal to
establish a new Depart-
ment of Urban Affairs
with an announcement
that Dr. Robert C. Weaver
was to be its head with
Cabinet rank, it was un-
necessary to explain that
his purpose was to tie an
important change in the
government's structure
with a bid for the Negro
vote in the cities, It was
not necessary because
anyone could see the im-
plication.
But since subtlety is not
a characteristic of poli-
tics, chairman John Bailey
and the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Col-
ored People rubbed in
directly what the Presi-
dent said by implication.
In reality, the purpose was
to charge that any mem-
ber of Congress who op-
posed the creation of the
new department was
actuated by racial preju-
dice.
From those who regard
the vital and important
process of politics as a
mere game of wits, this
move inspired by the Pres-
ident has elicited loud ho-
sannas. But a nation gov-
erned by demagoguery is
not a safe country to live
in, and it is not a country
which will approximate
the Constitutional purpose
of a more perfect union.
It is to be hoped that
the sober common sense of
intelligent and sincere
Americans in Congress
and elsewhere will see the
long-term perils of gov-
ernment by political
tricks, pranks and traps.
It may be that the per-
petration of this irrespon-
sible plan to trap votes for
this measure will mean
winning a skirmish and
losing a war. For this will
cast doubt upon the entire
program for which the
President will seek con-
gressional approval.
Last week in this col-
umn I discussed the pro-
posal for a new Depart-
ment of Urban Affairs on
its merits. It is merely a
plan to break off a chunk
from the sprawling bu-
reaucracy now unattached
to any of the departments
with Cabinet rank and
make it a separate depart-
ment.
Since the various hous-
ing and urban renewal
agencies deal with essen-
tially the same people and
subject matter now includ-
ed in the Department of
Health, Education and
Welfare, then Weaver's af-
fairs should go into that
department. While HEW
is very large, still it is
smaller, with its 70,335
civil servants, than the
Departments of Agricul-
ture, Post Office and De-
fense.
If it is desirable to have
a larger Cabinet to advise
a President who already
has so many advisers that
he can hardly count them
himself, there is no reason
why he cannot assemble
as many subordinates as
he wants and call them a
Cabinet.
But as Parkinson says
in "Parkinson's Law," Cab-
inets have a habit of grow-
ing larger and larger, un-
til the suffocation of ad-
vice becomes unendurable.
Then a piece breaks off
and becomes a super-Cab-
inet. Then that grows and
grows, and the axe must
be used again and again.
If, as seems to be the
motive in this case, the
purpose is representation,
then enlarge the Cabinet
on quite different grounds.
Have representatives of all
the races, nationalities,
and religions in the na-
tion present.
This might be called the
tribalization of advice.
Since there are many such
minorities in this free so-
ciety, the final product
would resemble the Gen-
eral Assembly of the Unit-
ed Nations.
Weaver, as well as all
thoughtful members of his
race, should resent the im-
plication in the proposed
appointment. If, as seems
generally to be assumed,
Weaver is a man of ex-
traordinary qualities, why
not wait a while and ap-
point him in place of Sec-
retary Ribicoff, who seems
to be anxious to return
to Connecticut?
