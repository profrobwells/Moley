Americans who have
long suspected that Jawa-
harlal Nehru is neither a
reliable friend of the cause
of freedom nor sincere in
his protestations against
Communist'aggression are
now justified by the ruth-
less action of his govern-
ment against the peaceful
Portuguese enclaves off
the coast in the Arabian
Sea.
The sanctimonious mask
has fallen, and Nehru's
pretense as the living heir
of Ghandi is repudiated.
His preliminaries to this
military action deserve to
be reviewed. First he came
to the United States, in
part to see about more
millions of aid from us.
His visit was also to feel
the pulse of American
policymakers before this
attack upon Portugal's na-
tional interests.
Finally, he hoped by ex-
hibiting his hypocritical
image to remind some de-
luded Americans that he
is in truth a noble charac-
ter. On his return jour-
ney he stopped in Egypt
to make sure that Presi-
dent Nasser would join
his conspiracy by closing
the Suez Canal to Portu-
guese aid to its Asiatic
dependencies.
But behind Nehru there
has always been his sinis-
ter partner, V. K. Krishna
Menon, whose Communist
bent is so well known.
The real reason for this
attack upon the enclaves
lies in a political crisis at
home. In the elections in
India in February, Menon
is opposed in his constitu-
ency by Acharya J. B.
Kripalani. This individual
is anti-Communist and an
opponent of the Menon-
dominated government.
He gave up a sure elec-
tion elsewhere to oppose
and, if possible, to send
Menon back to private life.
That he might succeed
has alarmed both Menon
and Nehru. Hence, noth-
ing could help so much
as a military victory for
Minister of Defense Men-
on.
To assure such a "tri-
umph," the smallest pos-
sible opponent was select-
ed. For there was little
these frail areas could do
to save themselves from
the Indian hordes which
attacked them.
Perhaps if it is possible
to win this election for
Menon, the next step will
be an effort to liquidate
the strong anti-Communist
government of Pakistan.
And Pakistan is the
strongest and most reli-
able friend of the United
States in all the Asiatic
mainland. The strain be-
tween India and Pakistan
mounts as Nehru and
Menon refuse to put the
Kashmir problem to a
plebiscite.
Nehru may understand
but fails to act upon the
proposition that his pious
neutralism would be im-
possible if there were no
United States standing
firmly against worldwide
communism.
That is also true of oth-
er neutrals. For without
the strength of the Unit-
ed States, all would suc-
cumb to the Communists.
And as former Vice Presi-
dent Nixon said in an ar-
ticle a few weeks ago,
Americans are getting a
"bellyful" of neutralism.
There is a way, how-
ever, to take action far
more effective against
Nehru and Menon's im-
perialistic adventures
than the words of Adlai
Stevenson in the Securi-
ty Council and the Presi-
dent's messages of pro-
test. That is to curtail
sharply the hundreds of
millions of aid which we
are giving Nehru's gov-
ernment. Also, in concert
with other European
powers, to stop or delay
the proposal for joint aid
to India.
