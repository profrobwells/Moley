Reason Lacking in Proposed New
U.S. Department of Urban Affairs
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The ever-increasing federal
control of local and
state government is now
proposed to be formalized
in a new Department of
Urban Affairs, with a seat
in the President's Cabinet.
There is no reason in
tradition or logic in such a
departmentalization. The
many interests which the
federal government now
has in local government
almost entirely pertain to
individual aid in health,
education, and welfare.
We already have a department
to care for that aid.
★
Let us first look at the
various departments
which are represented in
the Cabinet.
The first Cabinet was
composed of the heads of
departments created in
the first year of the Republic.
They were the secretaries of
State, Treasury, War (meaning
Army), Navy, and Justice.
These were charged with
the administration of powers
specifically designated
in the Constitution. In
1829 the Post Office Department,
which had been
in the Treasury, was given
Cabinet rank.
Then, as time went on,
the vast properties of the
nation acquired by purchase
and conquest and
other means had become
so large that in 1840 their
administration demanded
an Interior Department.
Up to that time, the reasons
for separate departments
were essentially
federal because of Constitutional
provisions and
ownership.
A change began in 1862,
when a vast economic interest
was recognized in
the creation of the Department
of Agriculture.
Then, after 41 years, in
1903, two other interests
were recognized in the
creation of a Department
of Commerce and Labor.
In 1913 this was divided
into the Departments of
Commerce and Labor respectively.
★
These three late-comers
-Agriculture, Commerce,
and Labor - were "interests"
in the sense that the
private businesses of the
nation had assumed an interstate
character of such
importance that the federal
government's regulation
and aid needed attention.
It was believed that
these three divergent private
interests, with millions
of Americans in
them, would have a person
at the Cabinet table
who would speak for them,
and also that these department
heads would be
able to speak to the interests
thus represented in
the name of the national
government at Washington.
*
The vast expansion of
our military forces, together
with the changed
character of military
power by the rise of air
power, brought about the
consolidated Department
of Defense in 1947.
Until that year, the
logical reason for a department
was well defined.
But after the great
depression, there was a
new philosophy of personal
aid by direct federal
contributions.
The recipients of such
aid were not in the real
sense private economic interests.
Nor were the private
associations or state
and local agencies engaged
in education,
health, and welfare such
interests. They were numerous
but not homogeneous.
Only in the fact that
they all wanted federal
money could they be
classed as an interest. Nor
could the ministration to
their wants be called a
federal function. Almost
always when one of these
new federal burdens was
assumed, it was regarded
as temporary.
And so the Department
of Health, Education and
Welfare became a catchall
for a vast spending congeries
of bureaucracies.
Just what the secretary of
HEW represents before
the country and in the
Cabinet is hard to understand.
*
But the concept of a Department
of Urban Affairs
would mean another kind
of definition of a representative.
Cities are separate
agencies of government.
Is the secretary of
such a department to be
the lobbyist-in-chief for
the mayors and councils of
cities?
If so, could not this be
done better by getting all
the city officials together
and have them select a
member of their group to
live in Washington?
