Romney May Be Using Faulty Fuel
in His Compact Political Vehicle
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Without pre-judging the
potential provided by
George Romney for the fu-
ture of the Republican
Party, several practical
considerations should he
faced.
The road to the Republican
National Convention
is long and rough. The
problems carried by who-
ever wins the nomination
must be very heavy.
And this is a formidable
burden even for an indi-
vidual who has pushed his
company into successful
competition in an industry
whose past is strewn with
failures.
*
The benign pat on the
back for the announced
candidate for the governor-
ship of Michigan by
the emeritus head of the
Republican Party, Gen. Ei-
senhower, must be assayed
with caution. The former
President's criteria for Re-
publican leadership reflect
qualities he himself pre-
sented in 1952 â€” complete
freedom from any taint of
Republicanism in earlier
days, and a name well
known in some field other
than political life.
This, of course, over-
looks the fact that a good
name needs loyal and ac-
tive work at the precinct
level by experienced work-
ers, sound organization,
and sound financial back-
ing to win in Michigan and
other states.
The former President
may have forgotten how
far short these qualifica-
tions were found to be in
the disaster which befell
his candidate, James P.
Mitchell, in New Jersey.
In many respects George
Romney meets the Eisen-
hower criteria. He said in
a television interview that
he never found it neces-
sary to identify himself
with the Republican Par-
ty until he sought a place
in the current constitu-
tional convention in Mich-
igan.
He pointed out that
there is a responsibility
higher than partisanship.
This is only measurably
true for, as he said, the re-
sponsibility of citizenship
comes first.
*
But one of the cardinal
qualifications of a good cit-
izen is respect for the two-
party system, without
which the liberties of the
individual would be in
grave jeopardy.
Romney said further, no
doubt referring to Michi-
gan, that the "image" of
the Republican Party is
that of a political entity
dedicated to business as
distinguished from citi-
zens' interests. This is the
"image" Democrats have
vigorously promoted for
their opposition.
It is true that the big
automobile companies cen-
tered in Michigan have un-
til recently been more con-
cerned with lobbying in
Lansing than with encour-
aging their employees at
the management level to
get into work at the pre-
cincts.
Any experienced Re-
publican politician in
Michigan could tell Rom-
ney that, but for the lack
of adequate funds in the
final weeks of the 1960
campaign and precinct
work in Wayne County,
an excellent Republican
candidate, Paul Bagwell,
would now be governor
and Nixon would have
carried the state.
*
It was not wealth but
poverty that fell before the
hosts and the money of
Reuther and Gus Scholle.
The vitality of the Re-
publican Party in Michi-
gan is in the chairmen of
counties and local com-
munities, and they will be
there next fall when Rom-
ney will be a candidate.
If they work hard and ef-
fectively, Romney will
win.
But to start a campaign
with critical comment
about the party one wants
to represent is hardly a
way to elicit that sort of
loyalty.
Certain views about
issues which Romney has
expressed are fine as gen-
eralities. But in certain
specifics he has taken a
curious line which is not
likely to endear him to
those who feel that it is
not the function of govern-
ment to determine the size
of a business, but only to
be sure that there is ade-
quate competition.
In testifying before the
Kefauver subcommittee on
anti-trust and monopoly,
Romney said that the size
of companies should be
limited to a specific per-
centage of the business of
the industry. This would
mean a procrustean bed
created by government,
either by distorting the in-
terpretation of the anti-
trust laws as they have
existed over the years or,
by a progressive corpora-
tion tax.
Either would constitute
a vast and unjustified in-
tervention by government
into economic life. So long
as real competition is as-
sured, the size of a com-
pany is a problem of the
market place, not of man-
agement, Congress, or the
Department of Justice.
Michigan needs a good
business manager in the
governorship. Its decline
and fiscal troubles, despite
its wealth and sturdy citi-
zenship, are deplorable.
Romney would probably
serve in an outstanding
fashion.
*
But in attaining that
position, he should display
something in the nature of
recognition of the state-
wide organization of his
party which will get peo-
ple to work in the pre-
cincts. For lying in wait
for him is a tightly-held,
efficient Reutherian ma-
chine which can mobilize
thousands of experienced
political workers, and im-
mense sums for a cam-
paign.
