Tough Politician Kennedy Shows
Signs of Becoming Thin-Skinned
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The President's cancella-
tion of subscriptions to the
New York Herald Tribune
because of his irritation
with its political views
can be the source of inno-
cent mirth. But the inci-
dent is symptomatic of sev-
eral significant develop-
ments of this administra-
tion and in John F. Ken-
nedy.
Not widely publicized is
the view, shared by the
President's valuable news-
paper friends who have
seen other Presidents and
officials smart under crit-
icism, that the behavior
around the White House
was "juvenile." The Ken-
nedy hide, covering a
shrewd and highly efficient
political tactician, once
thought to be as impervi-
ous as the Mercury cap-
sule's heat shield, is really
gauze-thin.
However, symptoms of
Mr. Kennedy's allergy to
criticism have grown more
pronounced as the author-
ity and powers of his office
have been exercised. He
shows impatience and cold-
ness toward reporters ask-
ing searching questions at
briefings and press confer-
ences, especially those rep-
resenting papers not par-
ticularly friendly to his
policies.

For a correspondent to
avoid discrimination, to ob-
tain special treatment and
"breaks" at the executive
level and throughout the
bureaucracy it is best not
to "cross" the administra-
tion, the Kennedy family,
or Press Secretary Salin-
ger.
Sam Rayburn's advice to
young Democratic con-
gressmen now applies to
those searching for stories
at the White House and in
the miles of corridors in
the bureaucracy: "The best
way to get along is to go
along."
But those who go along
will ultimately be frus-
trated if they are a credit
to their profession. For un-
der this stipulation, ob-
jectivity cannot be honored
under any administration.
The narcosis which can
overtake a man in the ex-
alted position of President
removes him not only from
unpleasant observations
but from a sense of reality.
He surrounds himself
with compliant advisers.
These associates close the
windows of his mind, and
eventually he slams shut
those that remain open.
The Cuban affair was an
early example of how the
President with his imme-
diate advisors dominated a
decision without the full
counsel of our military
chiefs. There have been
numerous other instances
demonstrating that diver-
sity of opinion, not to men-
tion ideology, is not wel-
comed.
It was Voltaire who said:
"May God defend me from
my friends; I can defend
myself from my enemies."
As a friend, Pierre Salin-
ger has apparently done
nothing by way of advis-
ing Mr. Kennedy against
rash outbreaks at the
press, and Salinger himself
has given the same tem-
peramental treatment to
members of the Fourth Es-
tate.
Salinger might benefit
from a study of the skill
of Stephen Early, who
served as press secretary
under President Roosevelt
after 1933. Early was al-
ways on the job, holding it
as his responsibility to act
as a buffer and at times a
mediator between the
President and the press
corps. His loyalty was both
to the President and to the
press, and on scores of oc-
casions he restrained Mr.
Roosevelt from unwise
outbursts at newspapers,
correspondents, editors,
and publishers.
While Early was never a
White House spokesman,
in the Kennedy regime
Salinger not only presents
news as a spokesman but
is sent abroad on interna-
tional missions.
In this administration,
as never before in our his-
tory, publicity is of para-
mount importance in the
minds of the President and
those around him. They
have tuned an enormous
engine of information and
activity to convey all sorts
of favorable impressions.
No item escapes their
care if it might produce
the slightest knock.
Although a great many
of the White House corr√©-
spondents are emotionally
and ideologically behind
Mr. Kennedy, many of
them are newspapermen
first. They are becoming
aware of Mr. Kennedy's
appetite for only those
things he likes, and the
tradition of their profes-
sion hardly calls for them
to become mere flatterers.
Those who fall from fa-
vor in the months ahead
may gain solace in know-
ing that they have wit-
nessed an age-old phenom-
enon, the pernicious ef-
fects of authority on those
who exercise it.
