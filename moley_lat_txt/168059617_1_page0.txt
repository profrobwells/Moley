Kennedy Falls Back on
Old Economic Cliches
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When President Kennedy asked Congress to lend
$100 million to the United
Nations, he said that this
would make that organization
"solvent."
Since I have never
heard that solvency could
be achieved by borrowing
more money, I was prepared
for the great exercise
in semantic make-believe
unfolded in the Yale
speech. For this attempt
to change the meaning of
words to the advantage of
the party in power is not
new. All that is new is the
prestidigitator.
In 1939, when Mr. Kennedy
was 22 years of age,
Washington was witnessing
a big investigation of
national economic policies
by the temporary National
Economic Committee.
Its major figures were liberals
whose purpose was
to divest our economic life
of what they then, like the
President now, considered
to be the "cliches of our
forebears."
There was prepared for
their confidential use a
memorandum on semantics
by Stuart Chase. Arthur
Krock secured a copy
of the document, "Standardizing
Terminology, or
First Aid to the Layman,"
and commented upon it in
the New York Times.
★
I secured a copy and, in
an article in the Saturday
Evening Post under date
of April 6, 1940, noted that
its purpose was to supply
a number of palatable definitions
for old, unpleasant
economic facts. Basically,
its purpose was to get people
to believe that "spending"
was "investment"
and that "thrift" meant
"economic stagnation."
The following are some
excerpts:
The memorandum boldly
began with the statement:
"'Savings' is a
'good' word, tenderly regarded
on the folkways."
It explained that "if 'savings'
are not invested, they
become 'hoardings,' or idle
money." "Debt" is likewise
"a very bad word
on the folkways."
★
Yet, Mr. Chase said it is
"important to keep 'debt'
and 'investment' closely
associated . . . otherwise
you are going to get stump
speeches on the horrors of
government debt and the
sublimities of private investment."
And now, warming to
his subject, Mr. Chase announced:
"'Spending' is a
'bad' word. Avoid it like a
copperhead. Talk about
'government running expenses'
and 'government
plant.'
"In connection with
'spending,' 'economy' will
be talked about. 'Economy'
is a beautiful word.
Visions of Uncle Abner,
rolling balls of waste
string. Economy, however,
means a 'loss' to somebody
else—a loss of 'sales' or
'wages.' Keep 'economy'
and 'loss' firmly associated."
And so Mr. Chase suggested
that it "might be
better to use two relatives:
"A rapidly expanding
economy," and "a slowly
expanding economy."
Now we find in the Yale
speech an almost exact
restatement of what was
current in the liberalism
of the 1930s. These attempts
to change definitions
are revived. They
are, according to the Yale
declaration, "old records,
long playing, left over
from the middle 30s."
But these 1962 records
sing the same song, only
in a quite different setting.
It is the President
who is guilty of "cliches."
It is he who is reviving
a mythology.
To show how closely Mr.
Kennedy is following the
line, consider this Yale
paragraph:
"The administrative
budget (which is a simple
statement of income and
outgo in dollars) omits
our special trust funds and
the effect they have on
our economy. It neglects
changes in assets and inventories.
And worst of all
it cannot distinguish between
operating expenditures
and long-term investments."
The point he makes here
is also a revival of an
ideal urged upon President
Roosevelt by some of the
predecessors of the Kennedy
advisers. They told
Kennedy
him that the way to balance
the budget would be
to put on the plus side as
"assets," the estimated
value of things which the
government had built,
such as highways, dams,
parks, etc.
Even the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln
Memorial might be used to
"balance" the budget
under this plan. Mr. Roosevelt
privately accepted this
and made some comments
about it in public. But
wiser heads in the administration,
including his
budget director, dissuaded
him from actually reconstructing
his budgets on
this plan.
He also toyed with the
"five-year" or "cyclical"
budget, which seems already
well on the way to
adoption in 1962.
It should be added that
President Kennedy's suggestion
that the trust
funds should be used in
calculating the budget is
the most absurd of all
these suggestions. For
the trust funds are not like
money in the bank. They
are federal IOUs which
must be redeemed when
needed out of current tax
collections.
★
They are not assets.
They are liabilities, no
matter how you change
the words.
And now we have Walter
Lippmann resurrecting
another cliche of the 1930s,
the term "reflating our
economy," which then was
designed to make deficits
more palatable.
Roger Blough, who listened
to the Yale speech,
might have learned from
this eloquent exercise in
make-believe how he could
have avoided his trouble
with the President. Under
this new government philosophy
he could have
kept the price of a ton of
steel where it was but
could have delivered only
1,800 lb.
