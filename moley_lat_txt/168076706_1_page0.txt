'Conservation' Proposal Imperils
Southern California Water Supply
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Our President, down to
the marrow of his bones
and the floor of his sub-
conscious mind, is the
greatest activist since
Theodore Roosevelt. He is
also by inheritance from
both sides of his family a
dedicated politician.
A basic rule in politics
is that seeming is just as
good as being.
In campaigning for elec-
tion the Kennedy theme
was "Let's get moving."
The cold war, the inequi-
ties in our domestic life,
the growth of our econ-
omy-all could be made
right by "doing some-
thing." And the country
bought the package.
★
But after nearly 14
months the cold war is still
with us. All of the efforts
toward its solution were
like those of his favorite
rocking chair—motion
without progress.
The dedicated inten-
tions of communism, the
infinitely slow progress of
primitive peoples toward
self-government, the in-
flexible operations of in-
ternational trade, all these
failed to change their
course at the behest of a
new American President.
But on the domestic
front came a barrage of
proposals for spending.
The bureaucracy always
has many projects ready
for a President who wants
to send a new message.
A good example is the
President's recent message
on "conservation." Embedded in that message are
two proposals which have
long met the immovable
common sense of Congress. They are called
"transmountain diversions."

Most readers of this
piece who live east of the
Mississippi will not understand what these are, nor
realize their importance.
But they had better understand, because the cost
of these projects will be
theirs to pay with their
taxes for years to come.
One of these is a project
which has been an issue in
Congress for several
years. It proposes to gather
water in the high reaches
of the Rockies in Colorado,
water which now creates
the Colorado River. Then
by a series of Rube Goldberg channels, tunnels
and pumps, it will dump
the water into the Arkansas River east of the Continental Divide.
★
Said water will then
help a few cities, but most
of it will reactivate agricultural lands and help
them grow products
which are already in surplus.
The other is in northwestern New Mexico and
is called the San Juan-
Chama project. This
would take water from the
San Juan River, which now flows into the Colorado, and dump it into the
Rio Grande basin east of
the divide. There, as in
the foregoing plan, products would be raised
which Uncle Sam is already paying farmers in
New Mexico not to plant.
Here is what the President could learn beyond
what I have noted above:
Along with Florida, the
fastest growing states in
population are Arizona,
California and Nevada.
They are the so-called lower basin States, whose
very life is dependent
upon the water of the
Colorado River.
It has been proved scientifically that the Colorado River now has a volume at least 2 million
acre ft. less than was earlier estimated. There is
hardly enough to supply
the needs of those states
now and surely, as their
population continues to
grow, there will be a dire
shortage of water.
But the President recommends that the Colorado be drained of its water upstream to grow
crops on which his Department of Agriculture is
spending millions to store
or not grow.
★
The reckless way of the
administration with money can be carried on by inflating the money supply.
But no government legerdemain, no robbing Peter to pay Paul by inflation can inflate the
amount of water which
supports Arizona, Southern California and Nevada.
