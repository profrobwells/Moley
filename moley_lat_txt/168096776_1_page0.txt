Congress is considering
an enormous program to
provide medical care for
millions of the elderly.
Taxpayers should have
some assurance that, if en-
acted, such a vast enter-.
prise would be adminis-
tered efficiently and with
the greatest possible econ-
omy. On the voluminous
record, there is no such
assurance. The compul-
sion to enact this jerry-
built program comes most-
ly from the political gains
that would accrue to the
administration and Con-
gress now in power. With
such a consideration para-
mount, it is not strange
that little consideration is
given to the critical ad-
ministrative machinery
which must accompany
and regulate the expendi-
tures involved.

In fact, Congress itself
should be weighed in the
balance to see whether in
the matters over which it
has direct control and
bears sole responsibility it
has shown any evidence of
administrative capacity.
Over the years Congress,
in the name of humanity,
has created and financed,
on an ever-rising scale,
many welfare programs
costing several billions an-
nually. Prominent among
these are General Public
Assistance, Old-Age As-
sistance, Aid to Dependent
Children, Aid to the Per-
manently and Totally Dis-
abled, and Aid to the
Blind.
The federal money is
poured out to the state and
local commurities, which
carry much of the load of
administration. So when
questions are propounded
to Congress concerning
glaring incompetence in
administration, the buck is
passed to the so-called sov-
ereign states.
But there is one area for
which no buck can be
passed. For the govern-
ment of the District of Co-
lumbia is specifically and
directly responsible to
District of Columbia Com-
mittees of the Senate and
House:
The Senate District of
Columbia Committee has
as its majority members
four eminent liberal Dem-
ocrats whose oratory
breathes forth their con-
cern for the poor and un-
fortunate and who vote
loyally for all or most of
the welfare measures
which come before Con-
gress. These are Alan
Bible of Nevada, Wayne
Morse of Oregon, Vance
Hartke of Indiana, and
Benjamin A. Smith II,
who as everyone knows,
was elevated to the seat he
occupies because he was
the college friend of our
President.
Surely these senators
are concerned with the
welfare of one and all.
Ostensibly they are con-
cerned with the taxpayers'
dollars.
But a report has just
been issued by the comp-
troller general of the Unit-
ed States which reveals a
condition of gross waste
and incompetence in the
operation of these afore-
mentioned welfare pro-
grams squarely in the
back yard of Congress.
The incompetence and
waste of the welfare pro-
grams in the district are
set forth in detail in a let-
ter with accompanying
proof which the comptrol-
ler general addressed to
the speaker of the House,
the President of the Unit-
ed States, the president of
the Senate, and the Board
of Commissioners of the
District of Columbia.
The report shows that
there is inadequate de-
termination of the eligibil-
ity of recipients of the re-
lief and welfare payments
and that there is inade-
quate supervision of the
cases to see whether the
need for which the pay-
ments are made has
passed. In other words,
people get on these pro-
grams without adequate
examination of their need
and are kept there in
many cases long after the
need has passed.

Considering this bun-
gling administration of
programs which under
the law provide benefits
when there is proof of
need, there is little wonder
that the sponsors of the
King-Anderson bill for
medical care want to
eliminate the question of
need altogether.
Finally, if Congress can-
not operate the little Dis-
trict of Columbia efficient-
ly, it is in a poor position
to make judgments affect-
ing the entire country.
