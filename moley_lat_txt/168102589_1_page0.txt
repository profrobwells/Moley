Wrangle Over Snake River Power
Project May Affect Entire Nation
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those who live east of
the Mississippi need to be
reminded occasionally that
they have vital interests in
what the federal govern-
ment is doing in places
which are not only remote
- from them in miles but
meaningful to them mere-
ly as spots on the map.
For the policies pursued
by the federal government
in those far-away spots
have a claim on the taxes
they pay and in a very
important degree will af-
fect the sort of gov-
ernment under which they
will live.
In this instance, the sub-
ject involves a heated con-
troversy in Washington
and Oregon over who shall
build a vast dam at a place
on the Snake River and
who shall get the benefit
of the electric power sub-
sequently to be generated
there.
The Snake River is one
of the most important
streams in the United
States. It rises in the
Teton Mountains in Wy-
oming and enters the Col-
umbia near Hanford,
Washington. Its length is
more than 1,000 miles. Its
valley is the most impor-
tant part of the state of
Idaho.
After it turns north, it
forms the boundary be-
tween Idaho and Oregon
and then between Idaho
and Washington.
For half its length after
it leaves the fertile valley
in southern Idaho, it winds
north and west in a des-
olate area-some of the
time in a deep canyon. In
that stretch it is almost
inaccessible to those who
travel on the good high-
ways.
Some years ago, it will
be remembered, there was
a furious controversy over
whether the dam at Hells
Canyon should be built
with federal money or by
the Idaho Power Co. Un-
der the Eisenhower ad-
ministration the authority
to build the dam was given
to the investor-owned com-
pany, and it is now reach-
ing completion without
being a burden on the na-
tion's taxpayers.
At the time of that ar-
gument, zealous advo-
cates of government pow-
er claimed that Hells Can-
yon was "the last remain-
ing site for a big hydro-
electric plant." Like most
of the arguments for so-
cialized power, that was
not true. For there are
other sites of great im-
portance downstream.
One of these is at a
place called Nez Perce,
where it would be possible
to build a dam of tremen-
dous height. But that site,
after being advocated for
some years, has been aban-
doned largely because
there was no means to per-
mit salmon to get up-
stream to their spawning
grounds in the Snake trib-
utaries and no way to let
the young salmon get
down to the sea.
So attention was then di-
rected at what is called
the Mountain Sheep site.
This is about 100 miles
downstream from Hells
Canyon, and the depth of
the canyon there is almost
as great.
A few years ago a few
of the major private pow-
er companies created a
joint corporation called the
Pacific Northwest Power
Co. and proposed to build
the dam with investors'
money. Then, a number of
public utility districts
joined in and also proposed
to build Mountain Sheep.
Thus there were arrayed
in the conflict public ver-
sus private or "investor-
owned" companies.
This issue is now before
the Federal Power Com-
mission for decision. After
a study by the commis-
sion's staff, an elaborate
report was submitted fa-
voring the public power
agencies.
The strike against the
investor-owned companies
seems to be a provision,
long incorporated in the
federal law, that when
two equally feasible pro-
posals are before the FPC
"preference" shall be giv-
en to the public power
agency.
The contention rested
on grounds that have lit-
tle practical meaning now.
After all, a private power
company is a public serv-
ant just as is a public
power agency. Both serve
American homes and fac-
tories. And under federal
state law, rates are regu-
lated to assure fairness to
the consumer.
But the law is there, and
the FPC must take note
of it. It may be a year be-
fore a decision is reached,
with interminable hear-
ings, legal and engineer-
ing opinions, and financial
representations of capacity
for financing the project.
