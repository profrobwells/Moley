America's 'Foreign Office' at U.N.
Frays Good Relations With Allies
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
HUTCHINSON, Kar. â€”
I find in traveling through
the states that the sharp
criticisms of the United
Nations and of American
official policy in its dealings
with that organization,
recently voiced in the
Senate, are confirmed by
most detached but
thoughtful Americans.
There is little of the isolationism
of two or three
decades ago. Nobody seems
to want to see the end of
the United Nations or to
have the United States
withdraw from it. But
Americans are wondering
if there are not better
ways of maintaining world
peace.
The crowning humiliation
of an impotent United
Nations recently came
when it was flouted by the
Adoula government in the
Congo. That government,
which could hardly have
existed at all or lasted this
long, was chosen by the
United Nations with
strong support by the
United States to rule over
the whole of the vast area
formerly known as the
Belgian Congo.
When the pro-Western,
anti-Communist Tshombe
government in the province
of Katanga failed to
reach satisfactory constitutional
arrangements with
the government in Leopoldville,
the United Nations
again, with the strong
support of the Washington
and U.N. administrations,
staged a fumbling attack
upon Katanga.
Under strong criticism
in the United States and
official dissent by the British
government, the United
Nations succeeded in
stopping the attack and in
bringing Adoula and
Tshombe together for consultation.
This was one of many
incidents which show that
the United Nations is not
a suitable instrument for
maintaining order and
peace in even small trouble
spots in the world. This
ineffectiveness and ineptitude
has been forcefully
pointed out by Democratic
Sens. Fulbright and Jackson.
And in the Senate debate
over the U.N. bonds
which the President
wanted the United States
to buy, the discussion
ranged over the whole of
our policy toward the U.N.
and the value of that instrument
after 17 years of
trial and error. Indeed,
one Democratic senator
noted that this was the
first time that the Senate
in a full-dress debate had
had an opportunity for a
frank appraisal of the U.N.
Meanwhile, American
policy, in supporting all
matters in the United Nations
which profess to be
anti-colonial, has frayed
relations with those big
Western powers which
formerly held colonies in
Africa and Asia. It is small
wonder that this strange,
wandering policy should
be resented by our friends
in Western Europe.
It is the contention of
such critics as Fulbright
and Jackson that much of
the confusion in American
policy is due to the presence
in fact of two American
foreign offices. One
of them is the Department
of State, with Secretary
Rusk at its head. The other
is the 'American office'
at the United Nations,
with Ambassador Adlai
Stevenson in charge.
In his reply to the criticisms
of his fellow Democrats,
Stevenson once
more exhibits his fuzzy
optimism about spreading
"democracy" where none
exists and will not exist
for a century or more.
He made a statement,
either by inadvertence or
deliberately, that there
are, in fact, two foreign
offices carrying on in the
name of the United States.
He said in effect that the
President makes foreign
policy and that he, Stevenson,
looks to the White
House for direction.
The fact is that since
1789 there has been a Department
of State with the
responsibility of conducting
our foreign policy.
There have been times
when that department has
been woefully inadequate.
It is still very badly organized.
But it is the official instrument
through which
the President must operate,
get his information
and maintain contacts
with foreign nations. If, as
it seems, Stevenson is a
free-wheeling foreign minister,
by-passing the secretary
of state in his contacts
with the President,
grave blunders are possible
in a world situation
such as this.
And in this situation,
what of that American
"prestige" which Mr. Kennedy
made a campaign issue
in 1960? What must
be the opinion of us within
the British government in
which the cabinet and
prime minister operate exclusively
through the foreign
minister in all matters
abroad?
It is small wonder that
the United Nations and
our close associations with
it are the subject of such
amazement and no little
alarm among our most reliable
allies.
