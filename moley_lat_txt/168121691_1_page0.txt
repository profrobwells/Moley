GOP Machinery Set for Overhaul,
New Spark Plugs and Better Fuel
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The measures taken by
the Republicans who gath-
ered at the Eisenhower
farm at Gettysburg strong-
ly suggest what was done
by the Conservative Party
in Britain after its defeat
in 1945. A few months aft-
er that defeat, certain par-
ty veterans like Churchill
took stock of what they
had and what they needed.
A British political writ-
er expressed their cogita-
tions in this way: "They
looked incredulously for
an explanation of their
1945 defeat and decided
that, since their principles
were immutable and unas-
sailable, they must have
been defeated by their ma-
chinery."
Churchill had never
given much attention to
organization. He believed
that with strong and re-
nowned leaders the party
could win elections with
little work at the street
and highway level.

Gen. Eisenhower said in
a letter to Republican
Chairman Miller, follow-
ing the Gettysburg meet-
ing:
"It is no secret that on
matters of basic principle
and ideals the Republican
Party is truly the nation's
majority party... But un-
fortunately, while we Re-
publicans have devoted
our attention to princi-
ples and programs... the
opposition has focused its
energies, working relent-
lessly and shrewdly, on the
arithmetic of winning elec-
tions through political or-
ganization."
Churchill, a year or so
after the 1945 election,
called upon Lord Woolton,
a businessman who had
served as minister of food
during the war, to take
over the organization of
the Conservative Party.
In this job he applied
efficient organizational
methods to party work. He
brought new blood into
the many constituency or-
ganizations, broadened the
base of the party machin-
ery, introduced a measure
of professional competence
into the party at the local
level, developed party
spirit in the urban areas
where a sort of non-parti-
sanship had prevailed,
appealed to the educated
people in the universities,
and, above all, created the
means to mobilize thou-
sands of volunteers in the
job of getting out the vote
at the local level.
He did not destroy the
old party organization, but
put new energy into it by
enlisting many people who
had never taken much in-
terest in politics before.
In the general election
of 1950, the revitalized
party almost edged out
the Attlee government,
then a year later it put
Churchill back as prime
minister with a majority
of about 25 in the House
of Commons. The party
organization kept up the
pace and won by 65 seats
in 1955 and by more than
100 in 1959.
This sort of success can
come to the Republican
Party through the general
plans developed at Gettys-
burg. The all-Republican
conference created there
can hold conferences simi-
lar to those held annually
in Britain, in which all
leaders of the party can
meet, discuss issues, and
set forth party statements
of policy.
Also, the national Re-
publican Citizens Commit-
tee can enlist the efforts
of volunteers in getting
out the vote for Republi-
can candidates by keeping
alive for the party such
volunteer groups as have
been created in many na-
tional elections. These
have hitherto been tempo-
rary groups which van-
ished after elections.
The new plan is to make
such groups permanent
and to have them work ef-
fectively with the regular
party organization to re-
cruit volunteers and raise
money for all candidates
in every election.
The regular accredited
leadership of the party,
such as the National Com-
mittee, the Republican
Congressional Committee,
and the Senate Campaign
Committee, and all the
state and local committees,
need have no fear that the
new group is trying to
take the party away from
them. Rather, the purpose
is to help the party get the
necessary votes and
finances to win election
for the legally nominated
candidates.

In 1935 President Roose-
velt deliberately encour-
aged volunteer auxiliary
help for the Democratic
Party. Such help from out-
side the party was not
only welcomed, but it was
promoted in every way
by Mr. Roosevelt, Mr.
Truman, and now by Mr.
Kennedy. And its proof is
its astonishing success.
The same thing can hap-
pen with the Republican
Party under these new
plans which Gen. Eisen-
hower has so enthusiastic-
ally hailed.
