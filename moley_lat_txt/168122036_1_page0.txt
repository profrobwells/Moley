Kennedy Defeats May Be Due to
His Lack of Contact With Public
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
President Kennedy has
brilliantly succeeded in
creating the image of an
attractive personality. But
his main domestic pro-
grams and plans, which he
has so vigorously promot-
ed, have fallen flat before
a disbelieving public and
a Congress which knows
that public so well.
With equal energy, Mr.
Kennedy has sought the
explanation for these de-
feats in every place ex-
cept the right one. The
real reason for his failure
lies not entirely in the pro-
grams which he so ardent-
ly and naively embraced-
remedies wholly inappro-
priate to the solution of
the problems for which
they were designed.
There is a still more
fundamental reason. This
lies in the nature, the
preparation, and the ex-
perience of the President
himself.

Let us consider Mr. Ken-
nedy and three of his top
priority plans-aid to ed-
ucation, farm regimenta-
tion, and medicare.
When we are confronted
with the complexities of
the balance of payments,
the status of gold, foreign
aid, and international
trade, most of us become
confused by the nature of
the problems themselves,
but even more so by the
economic jargon which be-
clouds the explanation.
But when the President
comes to grips with school
problems, with farm eco-
nomics, and with meeting
the cost of medical care,
his public has more down-
to-earth information and
deeper convictions than he
has. And members of Con-
gress, regardless of party,
live among and are essen-
tially a part of the lives of
those millions.
On the other hand, John
F. Kennedy has never ex-
perienced the intimate,
first-hand, continuous con-
tacts which might inform
him. His life has been
quite apart from, almost
foreign to, the millions of
people whose support he
must have if he is to suc-
ceed. It is a deficiency
which may well prove to
be politically fatal.

He was born a rich
man's son. This destined
him to grow up in a shel-
tered spot. There was no
struggle to earn a living or
to make ends meet.
His education was pro-
vided in a private school
in New York, at Choate
and Harvard. That path-
way of learning is not
crowded by people grimy
from contacts with the re-
alities of life.
Moreover, he was not
only a rich man's son, but
the son of a famous man.
From the time when John
F. was 17 years old he car-
ried a name known over
the land. This added to his
isolation.
*
In the Navy he served
with the officers com-
manding PT boats. That
branch of the military was
commonly called a sort of
Ivy League. These were
brave men willing to face
death. The badge of cour-
age can never be denied
the sons of any aristoc-
racy.
The President's political
career began in an area in
which he had never made
much contact. His life had
been lived mostly in New
York. When he entered
the contest for Congress,
he rented a two-room suite
in a hotel where his fa-
mous grandfather, Fitzger-
ald, lived.
An admiring biographer
says of his campaigning:
"He seemed out of place
and pathetically self-con-
scious in the tough tene-
ment districts of East Bos-
ton, Charlestown and East
Cambridge where most of
the voters lived."
Even the political at-
mosphere in which Mr.
Kennedy has lived since
then is a sort of isolation.
Vote calculations are sta-
tistical. Counts are made
not of individuals but of
interest groups, and the
appeals are made not to
the infinite variety of hu-
man life, but to the ap-
petites and purses of
those statistics.
As a congressman, sena-
tor, and President. Mr.
Kennedy has met people
almost wholly in the mass,
in the applauding groups
to whom fine words must
he spoken. And now in the
Presidency there is the su-
preme isolation of the
summit.
★
Only a person who
shared the passions, aspi-
rations, and and prejudices of
those who peopled his
early life can break
through this isolation to
the heart of things. That
is why the Kennedy ap-
peals still fail to catch
fire. They leave those who
hear them unmoved.
