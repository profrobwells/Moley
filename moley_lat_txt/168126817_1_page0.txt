The Political Mind Doesn't Always
Grasp the Economic Facts of Life
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
This writer claims
possession of no gift of
prophecy, economic or po-
litical. Nor is he equipped
with that mysterious mas-
tery of business indices
and other data which dis-
tinguish fancy economists.
Anyhow, he has spent
the past four weeks on the
Pacific Coast, an area
which is usually the last
to feel the coming of a
business decline. Such
phenomena usually rise in
the East and move west.
But since the economists
all are saying that the ap-
parent lack of confidence
in the business future is
based upon emotional and
mental factors rather than
on business indices, a few
comments or that score
may be in order.
The situation which we
all face is the disposition
of a political government
in Washington to take a
stronger hand in economic
life. Its success or failure
in such an effort depends
largely, if not entirely,
upon how the political
mind behaves in facing
economic affairs. Here, if
anywhere, is the key to
the situation:
The disposition of the
political mind, especially
the liberal complex repre-
sented in the Kennedy
administration, is to de-
partmentalize the popula-
tion for the purpose of
attaining an electoral ma-
jority. Votes and other
manifestations of political
support are gotten in pack-
ages. Classes are cre-
ated, and the larger class
numerically is pitted
against a smaller class.
Thus, workers and con-
sumers are incited to dis-
trust management. The
elderly are told that the
doctors' associations are
the enemies of the old and
ill.
This deeply embedded
concept of a departmental-
ized nation blinds politi-
cians to the essential
unities which prevail. The
business community is not
limited to the people who
have charge of manage-
ment.
It consists of those who
work for wages and sala-
ries, millions of large and
small stockholders, small
suppliers and big corpora-
tions, retailers and whole-
salers—we are all involved
in the business communi-
ty, sharing its ups and
downs, its bounties and its
denials. It is, as Franklin
D. Roosevelt once said, "a
seamless web."
But even Mr. Roosevelt
at the height of his popu-
larity in 1936 failed to ap-
preciate why this vast
community of interest
had the power to react
against his attacks upon
what he called "selfish
business interests" and, by
registering lack of confi-
dence, to frustrate his
policies and programs.
In the years 1935 and
1936 many wise people
tried to make him under-
stand the meaning of con-
fidence. But he rejected
them and, by an attack
upon prices in 1937, in-
vited a recession which
resulted in serious set-
backs at the polls in 1938.
The economy which had
been producing an annual
rate of gains up to 1936
did not recover until the
war loomed in 1940. And
unemployment, which fell
from 1933 to 1936, started
upward again.
Mr. Roosevelt said in a
heady moment in the cam-
paign in 1936 that certain
selfish interests had "met
their master"—meaning
himself. But there was a
master above the master
which is called confidence,
and a promising recovery
was stalled in its tracks.
It is no secret that there
is alarm at this moment
in the White House and
among the more thought-
ful members of the ad-
ministration about the
course of business. Also,
among the Kennedy mus-
keteers, there is much
marshalling of economic
statistics and words of re-
assurance.
But those who must
plan ahead, make plant
expansions, and bring out
new products, and also
those who invest in the
major companies, are not
impressed. They realize
that most government sta-
tistics are some weeks
old. Some of them even
antedate the steel contro-
versy.
The soothing words of
the President and others
are in sharp contrast with
the many upsetting pro-
posals which come from
the White House almost
every day. As Sen. Byrd
has said, there is a dis-
tressing deficit figure just
a month ahead, with the
prospect of deficits for
years to come.
The stock market de-
cline may not entirely be
caused by a crisis of con-
fidence. But it does mean
that a lot of people are
selling and not buying,
and that those who still
own stocks are seeing the
paper profits they thought
they had a few months
ago withering by the day.
All this involves a psy-
chological fact known as
confidence which the
President, like some of his
predecessors, has failed to
appreciate. And it may be
that, like all bygone
political leaders, he will
encounter serious trouble
even in the area of poli-
tics.
