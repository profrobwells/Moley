Symington, Humphrey:
Grim Lessons Learned
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are some weighty
lessons which can be derived
from the utter confusion in
which Sen. Symington's
ill-tempered and ill-timed
attack upon George
Humphrey left the investigation
of government stockpiles.
One is the lamentable
deterioration of the Senate
of the United States as a
legislative and investigatory
body. Another is the
deterioration in the executive
branch of government
which will certainly result
from demagogic attacks
upon experienced and able
businessmen who are induced
to serve in public office.
A final judgment is impossible
as to whether government
money was wasted in the
contract between the Hanna
Co. and the government,
which concerned supplies of
nickel. For the confusion
which resulted from Chairman
Symington's sudden adjournment
of the hearings left the whole
investigation in the air.
The complete defense of
George Humphrey was not
heard, nor was there any
explanation by the responsible
officials of the Truman
administration who made the
contracts. What Symington
did, apparently to make headlines
derogatory to Humphrey,
was to hit and run in a
summary fashion, despite the
protests of other members of
his committee. Even the most
casual observers of congressional
affairs in the past few years
have noted that, while the
Senate traditionally was the
legislative house held highest
in public esteem and in the
quality of its members and
procedures, the House of
Representatives has in recent
years risen to the foremost
place.
The Senate section of the
Congressional Record is
crammed with irrelevancies
and windy demagoguery. Its
investigations are, with a few
notable exceptions, prejudiced,
disorderly, and, above all,
reeking with politics. In my
own job as a journalist, I now
find that the record of
proceedings in the House is
meatier, more informative, and
more orderly.
The debacle in the Symington
hearings illustrates this
senatorial decline. Symington
himself is not a lawyer. Before
he came into public life his
experience was in various
businesses. Hence, in running
the investigation of the Hanna
contracts, he left most of the
planning to counsel and staff.
The witnesses who were heard
made big headlines derogatory
to the Hanna Co. and to its
former head, George Humphrey.
Then when Humphrey came
well equipped with counsel,
accountants and other informed
people from the company, he
clearly caught Symington and
his staff unprepared. Then the
chairman let loose a tirade
against the former Treasury
secretary. The members of the
committee apparently had no
advance notice that Symington
would attempt to sum up the
case before all the evidence
was heard. In a wholly arbitrary
way, he refused to permit the
case to go on and abruptly cut
off the protests of minority
members.
The strangest part of it all
was that the individuals who
represented the Truman
administration in making the
contracts were not heard from.
For this was a case in which
the old legal rule of caveat
emptor prevailed. If, as
Symington declared, the Hanna
Co. had the advantage in the
deal for nickel, why was this
alleged waste of public money
permitted? After Sens. Bush
and Beall challenged the chairman
on this point, the reply was
that Howard L. Young, who
shared that responsibility, was
physically unable to appear. But
on the very next day Young
gave a lengthy statement to
United Press International. And
so, if he was able to do this,
why was Symington's counsel
unable to go to St. Louis and
get the statement earlier?
Nothing showed that Humphrey
as secretary of the Treasury
for 4Â½ years had used his
official position to help the
company of which he had been
the head and in which he had
stock ownership (which he
revealed when he was appointed
in 1953). But the import of
Symington's tirade was that
Humphrey was a callous profiteer.
It was the minority members,
not Symington, who brought out
the fact that in 1957 these
Hanna contracts had been investigated
by a subcommittee of which
the then Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson
was head. Even more important
than this clumsy abuse of the
Senate's power of investigation
is the effect of demagogic attacks
upon that declining number of
experienced business and professional
people who are induced to
accept public office in any
administration. Since government
has sprawled so completely into
all business life, it is difficult
indeed to find any sizable
company which has not had some
dealings with it. The able and
responsible officials of such
companies become less willing to
risk attacks upon their integrity
which visit great damage on
their reputations, the companies
with which they had been associated
and their families and friends.

This means that the vast
executive operations of government
must be managed by people who
have had no real experience in
management or important professional
life. This may well be why so
many of the federal government's
operations are so incompetent and
wasteful. In the case of George
Humphrey, nothing has been shown
to contradict the fact that as
secretary of the Treasury he was a
most competent public servant who
stood at all times for efficiency
and economy in public business.
But he has been made the victim,
years later, of headlines made by
this fantastic abuse of senatorial
powers.
