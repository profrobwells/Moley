Party Labels May Come Unstuck
When Gov. Brown and Nixon Clash
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
SAN FRANCISCO—At
this time, five months be-
fore the November elec-
tion, it would be political-
ly advantageous to Rich-
ard M. Nixon to have peo-
ple in California believe
that he is the underdog
in his effort to win the
governorship.
For such an assump-
tion would infect Gov.
Brown's forces with over-
confidence and it would
inspire Nixon's people
with greater determina-
tion.
Most press comment
contributes to this picture
of Nixon facing a very se-
rious uphill fight.
Once more, as in every
California campaign, it is
pointed out that registra-
tion shows a heavy Demo-
cratic majority—this time,
of 57% to 40% for Re-
publicans. In round fig-
ures it is 3,834,000 Demo-
crats and 2,686,000 Re-
publicans.
It is widely assumed
from these figures that
Nixon to win must get
90% of the Republican
vote and 20% of the Dem-
ocratic vote.
From these assumptions
and statistics the assertion
is made that the Republi-
can candidate must be-
come more liberal to get
the necessary votes from
Brown's potential. That
conclusion is altogether
too pat to apply to the
complex which is Califor-
nia's electorate.
Now, after spending
three weeks before the pri-
mary and most of a week
since then in California, I
propose to examine these
assumptions in the light of
the facts.
In general, I believe
that the race down to the
wire in November will be
very close, with little jus-
tification for a prediction
—at least for a prediction
based upon the foregoing
assumptions.
It has been shown over
and over in California elec-
tions that a Democratic ad-
vantage in registration
means very little. Great
numbers among those who
register Democratic are
from Western states, in-
cluding Texas, and they
register in line with their
traditional party affilia-
tion.
There..re also many eld-
erly people who belong to
a pre-Roosevelt Democrat-
ic Party. That party was
quite unlike the liberal
Democratic majority
which now prevails na-
tionally.
Party affiliation as ex-
pressed in registration
means very little when the
choice is made in an elec-
tion.
The assumption that
Nixon must get 90% of the
Republicans and 20% of
the Democrats fails to take
into consideration several
important conditions. How
many of those who are reg-
istered will vote? What
proportion of Republicans
will vote, and what pro-
portion of Democrats will
vote? Certainly the per-
centage will be far less
than 100.
There is no way to de-
termine from past expe-
rience the answer to these
questions. The real fact is
that Nixon and Brown
both face an immense ag-
gregation of 6.5 million in-
dividuals who are not
much concerned with par-
ty labels.
The conclusion that to
get a lot of Democratic
votes a successful Repub-
lican must make a strong
liberal appeal might have
been true in the years dat-
ing back one or two dec-
ades when Earl Warren
was running for governor.
In present context, this is
true no longer.
The Democrats who
must be won by Nixon are
thousands of conserva-
tive Democrats whose
numbers have been grow-
ing rapidly in the years
since Warren left the
state.
The fact that in the re-
cent primary a consider-
able number of Republi-
cans voted for the more
conservative Joseph Shell
rather than for Nixon is
no evidence that these
were all "hard-core" ex-
treme conservatives. The
best estimate is that less
than 5% of the Shell vote
were members of the Birch
Society and that a large
proportion of the remain-
der were merely express-
ing opposition to Brown's
liberalism, and the Ken-
nedy administration.
All these are factors
which justify the conclu-
sion that Nixon and Brown
begin the contest on fair-
ly even terms.
