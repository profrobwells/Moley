The Dissidents in California and
New York Are Not Conservatives
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A little group, in which
Sen. Wayne Morse is the
most wordy, is creating
great embarrassment for
their party and its Presi-
dent by their opposition to
the communications satel-
lite bill.
But whether they win
or lose, we may be sure
that, in the campaign to
come these senators will
be out there shouting
mealy-mouthed hosannas
for their "great President"
and the liberal Democrat-
ic Party.
When the chips are
down, they will support
their party. They have
nowhere else to go if they
expect to stay in official
life.
That sort of conformity
is not found in certain in-
dividuals who are organiz-
ing to defeat Nixon in
California and Rockefeller
and Javits in New York.
In California, Nixon
emerged successfully from
a primary fight. But his
opponents in that primary
have pledged themselves
to support their party and
its candidates.
However, a group in
Sacramento, which is a
branch of a so-called party
called Conservatives of
America, with headquar-
ters in New Orleans, has
decided to attempt to de-
stroy Nixon by supporting
and voting for Gov. Brown.
In New York, a Conser-
vative Party has selected
candidates to help defeat
Rockefeller and Javits and
elect certain Democratic
candidates who have not
yet been chosen.
In California, these al-
leged conservatives do not
like Brown or agree with
what he stands for. Their
purpose is to weaken the
Republican Party and de-
stroy its chosen leader,
Richard Nixon.
In New York, they ig-
nore the fact that Rocke-
feller has been a compe-
tent and prudent governor
and a professed Republi-
can. Javits' voting record
is more liberal than that
of the majority of his par-
ty, but a study of 115 roll-
calls shows that his record
is more conservative than
that of 49 democratic sen-
ators.
It has been a habit of
those who write for the
public prints to call these
dissidents and destroyers
in California and New
York "conservative ex-
tremists." I don't mind
their being called extrem-
ists. But I resent their be-
ing called conservative.
During the past three
years, during which we
have heard so much
about these extremists, I
have carefully reviewed
the history and policies of
conservatism from Burke
to the present — its mood,
convictions and methods.
And I have formulated the
following definition of con-
servative:
The conservative puts
his faith in free men un-
fettered, so far as is prac-
ticable, by state authority.
He recognizes the human
fallibility of man, but he
believes he must learn
through his errors.
On the other hand, the
"liberal" has no faith at all
in the individual, but be-
lieves he must be sub-
jected to the tyranny of
an official elite.
The conservative ab-
hors violence and extrem-
ism. He believes neither
in sudden salvation nor in
instant damnation. His
objective is progress by
remedies for present prob-
lems achieved with the
guidelines of successfully
proved constitutional tra-
ditions. In achieving prog-
ress when confronted by a
governing majority dedi-
cated to "liberalism," he
believes in keeping things
from getting worse.
Finally, he recognizes
that to win a majority ca-
pable of reshaping nation-
al and state policies, he
must work through the
two-party system — an in-
stitution created in Anglo-
American life by the great
constitutionalists of the
past. It is an institution
which has been preserved
in Britain and the United
States while other nations
in the Western world have
been destroyed by their
multiple-party misgovern-
ment.
For their experience has
shown that many parties
end with one party, and a
one-party system ends in
a one-man system.
These alleged conserva-
tives in California and
New York do not conform
to the foregoing defini-
tion. Their reactionary sui-
cidal methods would, if
successful, lead us down to
the tragedy of the multi-
ple-party nations of con-
tinental Europe.
They would destroy the
very essence of conserva-
tive, moderate progress
and deny free men the
power to grow and to
achieve the general wel-
fare through orderly
change.
