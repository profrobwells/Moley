Proposed Tax on American Firms
Abroad May Slow Foreign Trade
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Millions of speeches,
statements and messages
have been made and bil-
lions of dollars spent in
the years since the war to
further the revival of free
nations. National purpose
was directed to the end
that communism might
not grow in those coun-
tries and that free enter-
prise might prevail in the
free world.
★
Over-all, the United
States dedicated itself to
the task of winning the
war of trade.
Thus, it is strange in-
deed that President Ken-
nedy and his supporters
in Congress should reverse
this policy by proposing a
tax change which will
heavily burden American
competition with the trade
of Communist countries in
the world market. It
would also withdraw
American investment from
free nations.
This proposal is em-
bodied in Section 13 in
the hastily prepared and
ill - considered 1962 tax
bill.
*
This section would im-
pose a federal tax on the
undistributed profits of
foreign corporations in
which Americans have
heavy investments. In
what follows, I am speak-
ing of operational, rather
than holding companies.
The problems of each are
quite different.
Some profits of these
companies are retained
because of the need for
constant expansion into
new markets and to main-
tain equipment and prod-
uct quality in the face of
heavy competition from
the rapidly recovering
economies of the free
world. These subsidiaries,
it should be understood,
do not compete with our
own industries, but with
foreign producers, includ-
ing those of Iron Curtain
nations. Nor do they deny
jobs to American workers.
★
These companies are in
no sense tax havens. They
were established with gov-
ernment approval and en-
couragement for the legiti-
mate purpose of making a
profit for American invest-
ors, spreading the name
of the parent companies'
products abroad, and ex-
panding the influence of
the United States. Their
profits, when returned as
dividends to investors
here, are subjected to our
income tax, and thus they
provide revenue for our
own government.
It has been made abun-
dantly clear that the mo-
ment these undistributed
earnings are made sub-
ject to the proposed U.S.
tax, the governments in
the countries where the
companies are located will
slap on a new tax to "soak
up" these profits before
they can be levied upon
by our Treasury. Thus,
the new tax would produce
little or nothing for the
United States.
*
The finance ministers of
the six Common Market
countries no doubt had
this in mind when they
made known to Treasury
Secretary Dillon that they
would not look with dis-
favor upon the proposed
American tax. But Dillon
quoted them to Congress
for the fantastic purpose of
supporting the bill.
Now Dillon really ought
to know more than he
seems to know. For he
spent four years in France
as our ambassador, and a
year as under secretary
of state in charge of eco-
nomic affairs. How, there-
fore, could he be so naive
as to believe that the fi-
nance ministers of Euro-
pean countries would of-
fer any advice that is not
in the interest of their
own treasuries?
*
It is right that they pro-
tect the interests of their
countries. In fact, Dillon
ought to be equally vigi-
lant in protecting the in-
terests of his own coun-
try, and so should the
President.
The net result of such a
tax would be to discour-
age American ventures
abroad. Republican House
members such as Curtis of
Missouri and Byrnes of
Wisconsin have pointed
out that the bill says
"Yankee come home."
Thus, it is strange that
an administration which
this proposal comes from
is making such an appeal
for more foreign trade.
For this is a proposal to
discourage American en-
terprise abroad. It is com-
pletely inconsistent with
the Kennedy trade bill. It
is benighted isolationism.
