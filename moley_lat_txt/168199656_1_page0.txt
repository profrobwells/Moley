The Political Race: It's Quite
a Whirl for Newsmen Covering It
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Democracy has its weird
rituals, incantations, and
superstitions, just as had
divinely inspired royal
families and tribal chief-
tains. A very important
item in democratic prac-
tice is the political cam-
paign. The populace be-
lieves that it is acquiring
the essential wisdom to
select an individual to
spend its money in public
office by witnessing and
sometimes participating in
the goings-on.
Two harried candidates
rush from place to place,
performing the symbolic
operations of palm-to-
palm contact with every
outstretched hand, by
speaking certain words
denoting denunciation of
the opponent and dedica-
tion to the people in their
affairs, and giving every
manner of pledge of fu-
ture bestowals of magic
benefits.
A' subsidiary rite that
attends the main opera-
tion is what is called "cov-
ering the campaign." This
is performed by writers
who follow the candidates
and prepare material for
the newspapers and other
media. Now this routine of
covering a campaign is, in
fact, older than democracy
itself. It is an ancient and
highly revered business.
I am not aware that Ho-
mer himself covered the
siege of Troy, but we do
know of the most celebrat-
ed reporter of ancient
times in his own writings,
Xenophon, for the com-
pletely mercenary purpose
of gain, joined other
Greeks of the same mind
and wandered far to the
east into a dynastic strug-
gle among the Persians.
Their candidate, Cyrus,
was killed in the fraternal
slaughter, and they found
themselves in a murder-
ously insupportable situa-
tion. There was nothing to
do but to start for home,
and home was a long way
off.
We are told of that re-
treat in what is now re-
vered in classical circles
as Xenophon's Anabasis.
It is a bloody account with
the Greeks contributing
their quota of manslaugh-
ter. I might add for the
benefit of modern Xeno-
phons that the ancient re-
porter finally acquired
wealth by capturing some-
body who was worth a pot-
ful of money.
Our modern Xenophons
are the employees of pub-
lishers and managers of
other media who want
their offerings to be as ex-
citing as possible. The re-
porter's task is not easy,
nor is his burden light.
Every great step in the art
of communication has
made the reporting of
what happens more diffi-
cult, because it must be
done literally on the run.
The means of transpor-
tation which accelerate
the movements of the can-
didates make for desper-
ately hurried reports. The
coming of the railroads
snipped away hours and
days from the time al-
lowed candidates to pre-
pare their remarks and for
reporters to tell about
them. The coming of air
transportation completed
the confusion.
The reporter following a
candidate ends his day
with a blurred impression
on his brain of many
crowds, millions of faces,
many speeches. I am now
in California, and here one
can hardly remember
whether the candidate
promised something in
Yreka or San Diego.
Moreover, there must be
meals, or parts thereof, of-
ten snatched at unearthly
hours. The reporters must
write as they run and
sleep wherever they can
close their eyes.
Then there is the prob-
lem of what they should
write. The candidate
makes many speeches to
many different crowds.
Thus there is much repe-
tition. The reporter won-
ders whether he should
not merely write an ac-
count of the places cov-
ered, with a rough esti-
mate of the number of peo-
ple who came out and lis-
tened, and let it go at that.
To compress into his dis-
patches all that has been
said is impossible. In the
1960 Presidential cam-
paign, even the corre-
spondents of the news-
papers that boast that they
print all the news that's
fit were reduced to esti-
mates of the size of
crowds and the vocal vol-
ume of the cheering. They
little noted what the men
who aspired to be Presi-
dent said they were going
to do about the United
States.
â˜…
And so many of these
Xenophons permit them-
selves to become cynical,
even savage, in their treat-
ment of their "coveree."
They blame him for the
bad food, the half-con-
sumed drinks, the miser-
able hotels, and all the at-
tendant physical malaise.
They like candidates
who turn aside from the
voters to attend to the ne-
cessities of the press.
Thus, those candidates get
the better stories and their
opponents get the repor-
torial digs that so affect
the result.
And everyone yearns
for the days of McKinley,
when a candidate ran on
his own front porch.
