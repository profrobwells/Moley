Our Sour 'Victory' in the Congo
Somehow in recent
months we have begun to
settle for something less
than untarnished honor.
There is jubilation on
the East River and the
Potomac over "success" in
the Congo where U.N.
mercenaries—Gurkhas,
Swedes and Irish—with
U.S. weapons in their
hands and American silver
in their pockets smashed
Katanga forces and
Tshombe, the most firmly
pro-western leader in Africa.
Some would place
these "victories" high
among our treasured military moments.

But how shall these
names echo down the
years—Kongola, Elisabethville and Jadotville?
The history of American
military efforts is studded
with words that ring
for Americans—Lexington
and Yorktown; Lake Erie,
Manila Bay, St. Mihiel and
the Argonne; Guadalcanal,
Midway, Leyte Gulf and
Iwo Jima; St. Lo, Bastogne, Ploesti and Remagen; the mountains of
Greece, Berlin, the Formosa Straits, the Pusan
perimeter and Inchon.
Now other words are
creeping in that sound
hollow and futile, tolling
defeat, stalemate, humiliation or disgrace—the Yalu,
Hungnam and the demarcation line; the jungles of
Viet-Nam and Laos and
the Bay of Pigs.
True, Americans did not
fight in all these places,
but American weapons,
support, and prestige were
committed in all. The military undertakings of recent years to which we
have been a party deserve
our thought before we rejoice in the fact that Khrushchev picked up his missiles and took them home.
We must not forget that he
left Cuba an armed camp
and a core of infection in
this hemisphere. Thousands of trained, skillful,
dedicated Red army men
are billeted in an area once
under the Monroe Doctrine. Soviet equipment of

all sorts poses a grave
threat to ourselves and
our neighbors. We must
not forget that men
trained by us and carrying
American weapons were
utterly defeated in the tragic Cuban invasion.
Move across the world
to Southeast Asia, where
some Americans are spilling their blood. Developments in that tortured
Moley
peninsula are hardly to be
regarded with satisfaction
even from a long point of
view.
In Laos our diplomats
have naively assumed
that the communists will
honor their word. We have
"neutralized" that strategic area, pulling our troops
out after spending half a
billion dollars exclusive of
military equipment. It
seems that trained soldiers
from North Viet-Nam, supplied by Soviet aircraft,
were too much. We agreed
to a "coalition government"—a proven device
for eventual communist
take-over.
The U.S. commander
there pointed out that if
the North Viet-Nam troops
do not depart, "the U.S.
government and the kingdom of Laos have lost a
major battle for peace." Of
course, on-ground inspection to verify that the
agreed withdrawal takes
place is virtually lacking.
Local communists hold
large areas under tight security control and only a
fraction of the North Vietnamese is known to have
passed through checkpoints.
Next door, in South
Viet-Nam our men are
bleeding alongside that
country's troops against
trained Communists operating from "privileged
sanctuaries" in North Viet-
Nam and Laos. U.S. military men agree that there
is need of vast improvement in leadership of the
South Viet-Namese and
more vigorous U.S. policies.
Persistence, persuasion,
and patience must continue in Southeast Asia,
perhaps for years. But
without realistic appreciation of lessons learned
about communist agreements, methods, strategy,
and tactics, frustration
will mount.

Turn to Korea. There
our forces fought to a bitter stalemate under severe restraints. Recall the
"privileged sanctuary"
across the Yalu. And when
Americans, South Koreans, and units from other
lands were sweeping north
for a second time, our government checked them.
Unwilling to exploit the
rout of a battered enemy,
we met him at the conference table and lived an illusion. North Korean and
Chinese bad faith in observing eventual terms
are patent.
No hollow jubilation can
obscure a record of failure and, worse, inexcusable miscalculation. No
"victories" by proxy over
a pro-United States, pro-
capitalist Katanga which
sought independence from
an irresponsible Leopoldville parliament can erase
a single, sorry line. Our
military efforts have fallen upon evil times indeed
when to gain "victories"
we must back the United
Nations in enterprises of
dubious morality, legality,
and wisdom. And by doing so we may yet be a
party to ignite the flames
of sanguinary tribal war
in the African bush.
