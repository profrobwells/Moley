Miller Suggested as
Presidential Prospect
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the spring of 1961
Sen, Thruston Morton re-
signed as chairman of the
Republican National Com-
mittee to give his full time
to his campaign for re-elec-
tion in Kentucky. The
members of the committee
and other Republican lead-
ers considered the choice
of a successor. There were
two attractive eligibles.
One was William E.
Miller of New York, a high-
ly respected member of
the House. The other was
Ray C. Bliss, chairman of
the Ohio State Central
Committee.
*
Bliss had proved his
genius for organization
over some years. But his
record in 1960 attracted
nationwide attention, for
not only had Republican
candidates in Ohio done
well in local and congres-
sional elections, but the
Nixon-Lodge ticket re-
ceived a 274,000 majority,
the largest in any state
which went Republican.
The choice between M11-
ler and Bliss was very dif-
ficult, for each represented
a talent essential to polit-
ical success. Miller was an
extraordinarily effective
speaker and a tireless cam-
paigner. Bliss was at his
best directing organiza-
tional affairs from his
headquarters.
In the nature of things,
Miller could not devote
full time to the national
committee. He was also a
congressman. Bliss is a
full-time political manager
who lets others make the
speeches. The national
committee chose Miller.
Both Bliss and Miller
went to work vigorously
in preparation for the 1962
campaign.

In the 18 months since
then, Miller has been a
truly brilliant spokesman
for his party. No one on
the national scene has
been a better representa-
tive of the opposition. In
debating on countless oc-
casions he has shown
knowledgeability,
resourcefulness, and force-
fulness. There have been
very few political leaders
in recent years in either
party who are, as the say-
ing goes, faster on their
feet on the platform and in
television.
Indeed, I wonder why,
since campaigning for
President has come to be
an exercise in persuasion,
no one has suggested him
among the eligibles for the
1964 Presidential nomina-
tion. It is sheer habit, not
to say superstition, which
limits speculation to a
handful of state governors.
Meanwhile, Bliss has
surpassed his remarkable
performance in Ohio in
1960. The Republican can-
didate for governor, James
A. Rhodes, was elected
with a plurality of more
than 550,000. Both Houses
in the State Legislature
are heavily Republican. In
the lower House, the party
division will be 88-49; in
the Senate, 20-13.
All the incumbent Re-
publican members of the
House of Representatives
from Ohio except one were
re-elected. Two seats were
wrested from Democrats,
and a Republican was
elected congressman-at-
large.
In evaluating the amaz-
ing job of organization
which Bliss accomplished,
it should be kept in mind
that there was no federal
or state patronage to help,
and Ohio's biggest city had
and still has a Democratic
majority.
If the Republican Party
is to succeed in future elec-
tions, it must have in its
high command the sort of
talent represented by Mil-
ler and Bliss. Republicans
would be wise if they spent
less time on speculating
about who is to be nom-
inated in 1964 and arguing
about whether the chosen
one should be liberal or
conservative. For no can-
didate can be elected un-
less there is in the Repub-
lican National Committee
the capacity (a) to get out
the vote, and (b) to pre-
sent effectively in the two
years ahead a convincing
case why President Ken-
nedy should be defeated.
For in our time no Re-
publican candidate except
a war hero can win with-
out a strong, articulate,
well organized party to
help him. The Republican
Party needs both Bliss and
Miller.
