Rockefeller's Prospects Bright
Despite Democrats, Conservatives
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In these brown October
days Gov. Rockefeller of
New York occupies the
happy position of a man
who would have to work
hard to lose re-election.
The Democrats have
worked with intense ener-
gy to assure Republican
success. And as only a
minor irritant to Rocke-
feller and Sen. Javits there
is only a cloud no wider
than a fanatic's mind. The
latter is a group which
has created a so-called
Conservative Party de-
signed to draw protest
votes against the Rocke-
feller-Javits ticket.
In the last two or three
decades I have been struck
by a weakness in the lib-
eral-controlled Democratic
Party which may well
prove fatal. It is an affin-
ity for mediocrity. As lib-
eralism has waxed the
quality of its personnel has
waned. The basic reasons
for this are too detailed to
discuss here but fine ex-
amples are presented in
the candidates chosen at
the Democratic convention
to run for governor and
U.S. senator.
There has prevailed for
several years a bitter con-
flict within the Demo-
cratic Party. On the one
hand there are the time-
tested regulars who have
held party posts for a long
time, some of whom were
in the metropolitan organ-
izations roughly and in-
accurately called Tam-
many Democrats. They
were not worse but some-
what better than those
who preceded them over
the long years. But with
the rise of a so-called Lib-
eral Party in New York,
certain ultra-liberals such
as former governor and
Sen. Herbert Lehman, El-
eanor Roosevelt and Mayor
Robert Wagner created
what they called a "re-
form" movement designed
to uproot the hardy per-
ennials. This drive suc-
ceeded last year in re-
electing the bumbling
mayor despite the convic-
tion of the oldtimers that
Wagner lacks the capacity
requisite for the job.
The "reformers" in their
success even changed the
hallowed name Tammany
Hall. In the selection of a
candidate for governor this
year pickings were very
slim indeed and the
paucity of material was
further complicated by the
liberals' determination to
have someone who sub-
scribed to all the tenets of
their welfare state. They
discarded tests of experi-
ence and proved capacity
and decided, as is so often
done these days, to nomi-
nate a man because he
bore the named of a well-
known father and grand-
father. Robert Morgen-
thau, the appointed victim,
is the son of Roosevelt's
secretary of the treasury
and the grandson of a for-
mer ambassador to Tur-
key and Democratic fund-
raiser extraordinary sev-
eral decades ago.
Since it was clear even
to the Morgenthau sup-
porters that their man
could not help himself, he
was sent post-haste to get
help from the Kennedys.
Then on his return he at-
tacked Rockefeller be-
cause of an alleged "se-
cret" intention to raise
taxes if re-elected. This is
dangerous business in pol-
itics because there can be
no record to probe a se-
cret known only to its pro-
genitor. Rockefeller denied
it and then Morgenthau's
partner on the Democratic
ticket, two-term State
Comptroller Arthur Le-
vitt, said there was noth-
ing to prove Morgenthau's
mind reading. Beyond that
bit of news the Morgen-
thau candidacy has stirred
hardly a leaf in the politi-
cal grove.
The Conservatives' pro-
test can hardly be taken
seriously by people of com-
mon sense who believe in
two-party government. It
is true that Rockefeller's
place in the ideological
spectrum is a number of
notches further toward
liberalism than Sen. Gold-
water's, but not far
enough to rank him with
most Democratic gover-
nors. His dedication to fis-
cal responsibility is
proved by his record as
governor. His policies
have attracted a considera-
ble amount of new busi-
ness to New York. And in
1962, unlike 1958, he is
running as a straight Re-
publican candidate. He
and his colleagues on the
ticket, including Sen. Ja-
vits, are running as a "one
for all and all for one" Re-
publican team. The alleged
Conservatives look a bit
ridiculous since the pro-
spective beneficiary of
their protest is Robert
Morgenthau.
It is true that Sen. Ja-
vits' voting record is that
of a very liberal Republi-
can. But it is more conser-
vative than 47 of his Dem-
ocratic colleagues there.
As one conservative
New York Republican said
recently, "When I ask for
my favorite Glencannon's
special Scotch at a pack-
age store and they don't
have it I am not going to
stop drinking. I shall vote
for Javits as a better con-
servative than the man he
is running against."
These irreconcilable peo-
ple are violating the very
basis of the conservative
tradition, which is the art
of the possible. They may
take 200,000 or 300,000
from Rockefeller's major-
ity but not enough to pre-
vent the New York gov-
ernor from being a strong
prospect for the Republi-
can nomination in 1964.
