Goldwater: Will He or Won't He?
PHOENIX, Ariz. Here
in Goldwater country it is
difficult to escape the
infectious enthusiasm for
a favorite son. Thousands
here and in the states of
Oklahoma and Texas,
which I have visited on
the way out from New
York, believe Sen. Barry
Goldwater cannot only be
nominated as the Republi-
can candidate for Pres-
ident next year but elect-
ed.
In fact, these people
believe he is the only
Republican candidate who
could defeat President
Kennedy.
*
That is a matter that
only time can determine.
But it is possible to state
what Goldwater thinks
about it and to offer a few
comments of my own upon
what may happen.
When Goldwater says
he is thinking only about
his candidacy for the Sen-
ate in 1964, he means
just that. He realizes that
seeking a Presidential
nomination is a very pre-
carious enterprise. The
paths to nominations in
the past have been strewn
with frustrated hopes. The
odds in that race, so far as
members of a party out of
power are concerned, are
heavily against every en-
try.
There is timing to be
considered also. To be in
the lead too soon is more
often than not fatal. Condi-
tions change from month
to month â€” conditions
which affect the Kennedy
fortunes and popularity.
Successes and failures,
both domestic and interna-
tional, succeed each other
with regularity. No one
knows how those may
affect the potential of the
President.
Goldwater enjoys the
life of a senator and also
his great influence in the
national scene. Even if it
were legally possible for
him to run for re-election
as senator here and also
for President, it would be
very risky business. For
Arizona is not Texas,
where Lyndon B. Johnson
arranged in 1960 to be a
Goldwater
candidate for senator and
Vice President at the same
time.
Until Goldwater ap-
peared in politics, Arizona
was a Democratic state and
Democratic strength is
still formidable except in
Maricopa County. To ter-
minate Goldwater's career
in public office would be a
loss not only to him but to
the causes for which he is
so notable an exponent.
Almost single-handed
since he entered the Sen-
ate in 1953, he has made
the word "conservative"
respectable and meaning-
ful in this country.
*
So he has determined to
have no part, even by tacit
approval, in the Goldwa-
ter-for-President move-
ment.
But the demand for him
is a reality. It is over-
whelming among the
growing ranks of Republi-
cans in the South and all
over the West and Mid-
West.
To combine the political
values of both Nelson
Rockefeller and Goldwa-
ter in a ticket is wishful
thinking by those who
have a habit of seeking
compromise. For Goldwa-
ter would rather be a
senator than a Vice Pres-
ident.
*
While there has been no
announcement, Rockefel-
ler may well actively seek
delegates through a strong
organization and enter the
primaries, the first of
which is still 11 months
away.
Goldwater sentiment
will grow stronger in all
these months. And if the
sentiment for Goldwater,
without his lifting a finger
himself, is strong enough
literally to force a nomina-
tion at the Republican
convention 15 months
hence, there will be
evidence that Goldwater
can win the election.
That may resolve the
problem. But if Rockefel-
ler is nominated, he can be
assured of strong and
active support from the
Arizona senator.
*
One factor must be
considered. Goldwater is a
loyal party man. He is no
extremist. He has little
sympathy for extreme
people who call them-
selves conservative and
who will scatter and run if,
as is essential in any
candidate, Goldwater
should follow a course
which would unite his
party.
His best friends under-
stand this out here. For
even in Arizona there has
been unhappiness among
the ultra-conservatives
about Goldwater's reason-
able moderation.
The value of Goldwater
is for those sincere conser-
vative Republicans who
are moderate in their
demands for change. The
extremists are not worth
anything to the Republl-
can cause. They are a
cross to bear, not a staff to
support.
