McNamara's 'Intellectuals' Ignore
Military in Optional Response Plan
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
So much discussion has
been provoked by the
Stewart Alsop-Charles
Bartlett article in the Sat-
urday Evening Post about
the Cuban crisis that an
article in the previous edi-
tion of that magazine by
Stewart Alsop has been all
but forgotten.
But it raises not only
the same question about
government news man-
agement but even more
serious issues of method
and policy.
The President in his
press conference dis-
claimed responsibility for
what his "old friends," Al-
sop and Bartlett, wrote.
But he cannot well dis-
claim this one, because it
is based upon lengthy quo-
tations from Defense Sec-
retary McNamara.
And it came at a time
when Arthur Sylvester,
speaking for the Defense
Department, was saying
that it was an administra-
tion plan to influence for-
eign policy through news
management.
In the McNamara
article Alsop says that
when the new defense sec-
retary entered office he
surrounded himself with a
group of "intellectuals."
These were individuals
with skills in industry and
academic life. Thus, a gen-
eral or admiral is not an
"intellectual." McNamara
is the super "intellectual."

'These civilians decided,
according to the article,
that the Eisenhower war
strategy of "massive re-
taliation" in case of a So-
viet attack was not a plan
but a "horrible spasm."
And so they have craf-
ted a new plan, described
as the "doctrine of con-
trolled response." This
would provide a series of
"options" in case of a Com-
munist attack.
These would be ar-
ranged in a series of "but-
tons" for the President to
press in case of attack.
They would range from a
war with conventional
weapons to an all-out nu-
clear devastation of Com-
munist cities and military
installations.
The favored alternative
would be an American re-
sponse which would hit no
cities but only military
targets. Thus, after we
had sustained the first
blast, we would destroy the
capability of the Soviet to
launch another. But such
a survival would depend
upon a vast system of shel-
ters for our population.
This disclosure of our
plans may well be intend-
ed to suggest to the Soviet
leaders that they should
consider a war in which
they would limit their at-
tack to our military estab-
lishments and spare our
civilian population.
This is called a "no-city"
attack. Thus, this article
would be a step in long-
range, indirect negotia-
tion.
I am not sufficiently
versed in military affairs
to venture a judgment as
to the wisdom of this plan
of the "intellectuals." But
a number of observations
seem to be in order.
*
The administration
seems to have adopted
and announced a type of
strategy created by people
who have had no military
experience prior to the
coming of this administra-
tion.
McNamara himself was
selected, we may assume,
because he had experience
to qualify him to be a top
production manager, re-
sponsible for buying mili-
tary hardware of the best
quality at the least cost.
Certainly, we have no
reason to believe him to be
a Napoleon, a Clausewitz,
a Bismarck, a Frederick
the Great, or a Gustavus
Adolphus.
To allay any doubts be-
cause of McNamara's lack
of military competence
and presumably also to
express fitting gratitude
for getting an "exclusive"
story, Alsop assures us
that the Defense secretary
has "the highest intelli-
gence quotient of any pub-
lic official in this century."
*
This is taking in a lot
of territory. For if Mc-
Namara towers so high
above our present crop of
officials, we might ponder
why the "buttons" should
not be removed from the
White House to McNa-
mara's office.
Alsop makes clear that
there are military people,
especially in the Air Force,
who disagree with the
plans of the "intellectuals."
This is disquieting, be-
cause we all remember
how the Bay of Pigs disas-
ter occurred because the
civilians ignored experi-
enced military advice.
Moreover, it may be
asked why a plan of such
magnitude should not
have been issued as a re-
sponsible public document
rather than in a magazine
article by a privileged pri-
vate journalist.
