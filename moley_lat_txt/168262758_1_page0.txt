Americans Should Revise Judgment
of De Gaulle in Light of the Past
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Whenever I find una-
nimity of opinion between
the British government
and our own on any specif-
ic subject, I feel sure that
both are wrong.
There is excellent his-
torical evidence on this
point. At the present time,
both governments regard
President de Gaulle as
something of a marplot.
Also American and British
correspondents are busily
writing contemptuous
comments about him. And
cartoonists make merry
with his long frame and
long nose. But while no
one can deny these phys-
ical oddities, another
characteristic seems to be
forgotten.

De Gaulle has a memory
as long as his nose. And
what he could not be ex-
pected to remember about
the events of 1940-1945 he
has been able to read in
the memoirs of statesmen
who participated in the
events of that period. In
De Gaulle's case the recol-
lections of Churchill and
Adm. Leahy, who had
been our minister-in-wait-
ing at the Vichy headquar-
ters of Petain and Laval,
are revealing.

Ordinarily, I would not
regard Elliott Roosevelt
as a reliable historian. But
in his book, "As He Saw
It," he tells about his ob-
servations at the Casa-
blanca conference in 1943.
He quotes his father as
saying, "I cannot imagine
a man I would distrust
more." This feeling of Roo-
sevelt toward De Gaulle is
confirmed by Churchill
and Leahy.

Indeed, so bitter was
Roosevelt toward the lead-
er of the Free French at
that time that he made
merry in private by in-
venting corny and con-
temptuous characteriza-
tions of the man. In all of
his talks with Churchill,
Roosevelt called De
Gaulle "Winston's problem
child." Nor was Churchill
less harsh in his judg-
ments.

Earlier than Casablanca,
Roosevelt and Churchill
had deliberately kept De
Gaulle in the dark about
the planned invasion of
North Africa. Meanwhile,
our State Department had
"sold" Roosevelt complete-
ly on the reliability of Gen.
Giraud. And so when De
Gaulle came to Casablanca,

Churchill and Roosevelt
invented the preposterous
idea that De Gaulle and
Giraud should be the joint
rulers of French forces and
of such of France as would
be liberated. This would be
like appointing Leo Du-
rocher and Casey Stengel
as joint managers of the
Los Angeles Dodgers.

In every way Roosevelt
and Churchill treated De
Gaulle with a lack of con-
sideration which was no
doubt searing to the mind
and pride of a man who
had stood almost alone for
the dignity of France in
her years of humiliation.
Later, in the grand plans
for setting the world to
rights France was exclud-
ed from membership in
the favored circle which
consisted of China, Russia,
Britain, and the United
States.

Events proved that
Churchill and Roosevelt
were dead wrong in their
estimate of De Gaulle. He
was a man who could be
trusted, and his lack of
personal ambition was re-
vealed when he chose vol-
untary exile from French
affairs for 13 years after
1945. His capacity to unite
the French has been
proved since 1958.

For despite the earlier
doubts of both Britain and
the United States, he has
united the French, has
promoted the growth of
the French nation into a
period of unexampled
prosperity, and finally has
ended a war in Algeria
which had defied the ef-
forts of French govern-
ments for many years.
In the light of these
facts, can anyone doubt
the feelings of De Gaulle
when the two successors
of Churchill and Roosevelt
had their cozy chat in Nas-
sau? De Gaulle beyond
shadow of a doubt be-
lieves that Britain, if ad-
mitted to the Common
Market, would revert to
its traditional policy of
acting as a detached me-
diator-in-chief among the
continental nations.

Since French statesmen
were in the forefront in
creating the Common Mar-
ket, De Gaulle had some
right to feel that he should
regard the entry of Brit-
ain into that circle as sub-
ject to suspicion.
There is no reason to
believe that De Gaulle will
not permit Britain to en-
ter, but when he does it
is certain that Britain
must permit him to deter-
mine the conditions.

For these reasons, it
seems to me that Ameri-
cans should revise their
judgments about this man
who truly represents a
new and powerful factor
in world affairs. The gov-
ernment of the United
States has been wrong
about De Gaulle in the
past. It is reasonable to
guess that the Kennedy
administration is wrong
now.
