Issues Look Promising
for GOP in 1964 Race
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
If issues were all that
were needed to win an
election, Republicans
might well look to 1964
with exhilarating optimism. But more important
than issues are organization and attractive candidates. And the most important of all is organization.
Republicans have an
abundance of issues. The
extravagant promises of
candidate John F. Kennedy in 1960 have not
been fulfilled. Not only
have this welfare programs
been rejected in Congress,
but they have not ignited
enthusiastic support
among the citizens of the
nation.
â˜…
There is cause and effect here. For had those
programs been appealing,
there would have been
more response in Congress. Moreover, Mr.
Kennedy's defense of his
welfare programs has not
been effectively presented. His mind and his political sense have been in
his appeals, but not his
heart and emotion.
His strange and unorthodox fiscal policies have
not been accepted by the
public. Such concepts as
planned deficits and
growth by spending and
the rejection of the copybook maxims are widely
accepted in the academic
world, but they are remote
from the traditions and
habits of voters.

On the international
scene, this administration
has been inept and fumbling. Communism has not
lost ground. It has gained.
The administration has
chilled our friendships
with our former stout allies. The Cuban fiasco
from first to last has been
well aired and is well
known to the public.
Even the military policies of the excessively
dynamic Secretary Robert
McNamara have been
thrown under clouds of
doubt and suspicion. At
this writing, the Republicans have more and better
issues than they have had
in many years.
It would be idle to speculate at this time about a
Republican candidate
against Mr. Kennedy. The
"most mentioned" are
Goldwater and Rockefeller, or Rockefeller and
Goldwater, according to
what part of the country
you are listening to.
Rockefeller has made
speeches which differentiate his policies from
those of the President. He
has also been a wise and
prudent governor.
Goldwater elicits great
enthusiasm wherever he
travels, but he has a hard
race for re-election to the
Senate before him and he
might not actively seek
the nomination.
But in organization, the
advantages are all with
the President. As President, he has available
what F. D. R. once called
"vast instrumentalities of
power." Great expenditures of federal money
win grateful and still expectant support. The immense bureaucracy, despite Civil Service and the
Hatch Act, provides a nationwide machine. Whole
regions, and especially
urban centers, can be won
by federal grants, subventions, and defense
contracts.

On the other hand, the
weaknesses in Republican
organization which lost
the election Richard
Nixon in 1960 still remain. Only minor repairs
have been made.
The brightest spot is in
the South, where Republicanism is vigorously
promoted and is growing
fast.
