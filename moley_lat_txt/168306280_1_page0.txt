Nixon's Move to N.Y.---
the Personal Motives
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A good many items in
the published speculation
about Richard Nixon's de-
cision to move to New
York are vain imaginings.
This is not unusual. For
since politics is a business
of seeming, not being, the
statements of people in
public life leave much to
the imagination.
Newspaper people, even
the most conscientious,
must use speculation
when knowledge fails.
In this case, a bit of
common sense, together
with very authentic infor-
mation, provides the fol-
lowing quite simple ex-
planation for Nixon's deci-
sion:
Ever since the election
in 1960, Nixon has been
weighing many alterna-
tives. His first decision
was to remove himself
from contention for anoth-
er Presidential nomination
in 1964.
Certainly he did not
entertain at that time, or
for months later, any
desire to run for governor
of California.
When the possibility of
running for the governor-
ship came up, Nixon's
advisers were divided into
two classes.
One group said he
should keep his name
before the country as a
possibility for another
Presidential nomination.
They said that as a private
citizen his image would
fade and his influence
deteriorate.
They said, further, that
only a man like Adlai
Stevenson, who had a
considerable personal for-
tune, could keep his name
before the country while
in private life.
But Nixon, unlike most
of the major political fig-
ures in our time, had no
personal fortune and was
compelled to earn a living
for his family.
Other friends advised
him not to run for gover-
nor. They argued that
while practicing law he
would still be able to keep
his name before the coun-
try by occasional impor-
tant addresses on national
and international affairs.
Further, they argued, if
he ran for the governor-
ship, he would be com-
pelled to talk only about
state affairs and, because
of his long absence from
California, such matters
were quite unfamiliar to
him.
In fact, he was essential-
ly equipped by experience
and contacts to voice opin-
ions on the national level.
It was also clear that
even if he were elected
governor, he would be
immersed in difficult state
problems and would he
confronted in Sacramento
by a hostile Legislature.
In short, he would be
just another governor
struggling with the proh-
lems of welfare, education,
institutional care, high-
ways, and law enforce-
ment.
And if he lost the
governorship, the blow to
his prestige and influence
would be almost fatal.
But for many reasons,
which were quite worthy,
he yielded to the first
group of advisers. He ran
in a hard primary and still
more onerous election
campaign and lost.
After this second defeat,
the people who advised
him to run for governor
urged him not to leave
California. They urged
this with all sorts of rea-
sons-mostly quite unreal-
istic, considering the state
of political affairs in Cali-
fornia. This time, Nixon
did not follow their advice.
Those who had advised
him not to run for gover-
nor advised him to move
to New York. They point-
ed out that, because of the
state of the Republican
Party in California, he
could do little to make it
effective.
They said also that for a
long time his time would
be wasted in hearing post-
mortems about what hap-
pened in 1962.
Nixon has had to consi-
der certain factors which
were decisive. There was
his position as a public
figure, which involves
something more than
holding or aspiring to
public office. Rather, it is
the responsibility of an
individual who is well
known and has wide in-
fluence to comment effec-
tively on public affairs.
For meeting this re-
sponsibility. New York has
unique advantages. It is
the major center of com-
munications in the world.
It is a center of publishing.
of finance, and of large
corporate management.
It is also a gateway to
the world abroad. It is not
a restful place to live, but
it is enormously stimulat-
ing. Such stimulation
means a great deal to
anyone who participates
in public life.
Since Nixon must earn
his living by the law, he
would find his talents in
demand by a law firm
which has large national
and international connec-
tions. The legal association
which he has made will
enable him to provide for
his family educational and
cultural opportunities
equal to those of Califor-
nia.
Finally, in the great
complex of this metropoli-
tan area, one can be
interested in politics with-
out getting entangled with
local and state organiza-
tion problems.
For these reasons. Nix-
on seems to have made his
decision.
And in doing so, he may
well be written off in
speculations about any
personal ambitions for
some years to come. His
word on this ought to be
accepted as sincere and
final.
