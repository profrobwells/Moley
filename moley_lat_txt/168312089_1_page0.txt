Wheat Vote a Blow for Freedom
The wheat plebiscite
should reveal in plain
statistics to the Kennedy
brothers that their general
political strategy grossly
misunderstands the char-
acter and spirit of the
American people.
With their heads clear
and with the cold facts
before them, the farmers
deliberately chose a
course which, temporarily
at least, means more ar-
duous planning and less
return for their product.
Not only did they reject
the administration's pro-
gram itself, but they regis-
tered their scorn and
contempt for the vast
propaganda effort directed
at them by the administra-
tion and with the taxpay-
ers' money.

The Kennedy-Freeman
appeal asked them whe-
ther they would rather
have two dollars than one
dollar. They answered, "A
dollar, if necessary, with
freedom." The crass
materialism of the appeal
was apparently regarded
as an affront to the pride
and independence of
Americans.
This remarkable vote
has a lesson for all of us.
Politicians have for a
long time been operating
according to what in high-
brow circles is called eco-
nomic determinism. For
half a century it has
dominated our history text-
books, our political litera-
ture, and the strategy of
our political campaigns.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
But this philosophy,
which was an adaptation
of what Karl Marx wrote,
would have us believe that
the Constitution of the
United States was written
by a lot of people who
wanted only to protect
their property and that
Freeman
the Civil War was a
conflict of two rival econo-
mic systems.
It would also have us
believe that political pre-
dictions can be based upon
a calculation of voters'
economic wants and ne-
cessities.
In 1952, noting that the
Democratic campaign slo-
gan was "you never had it
so good," I wrote this:
"People are moved by
many impulses other than
those with roots in their
stomachs and pocket-
books. Human beings are
endowed with sentiments
of idealism, loyalty, and
pride associated with their
homes, their families,
their communities, their
friends, their ancestry,
traditions, religion, and
their nation.
"These sentiments find
expression in songs,
stories, bits of folklore,
associations, and mem-
ories. These fill a large
part of life. To evoke them
is to give pleasure and to
enrich. They make hard-
ships endurable, mistakes
tolerable, inconsistency,
understandable, and even
failure bearable. Within
them is the heart of
political conservatism."

That idea came back to
me when I saw and heard
on television John F. Ken-
nedy summing up his
campaign in the Chicago
auditorium and the New
York Coliseum in Novem-
ber, 1960. Pointing here
and there, as if to address
this and that special inter-
est, he repeated his promi-
ses. He was, in effect,
chopping the electorate
into little pieces of specific
wants.
The candidate mentioned
more pay for the unem-
ployed, medical care for
the elderly, federal money
for schools for the children
and free college education
for teenagers, more pay
for teachers, new plumb-
ing for 5 million homes.
The melodramatic pro-
mises with gestures repre-
sented not only gross
materialism but reckless
disregard of means to
their end.
