Teacher Associations Trying to
Share in Management of Schools
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Considerable notice has
appeared in the press over
the nation about the con-
troversy in Utah between
the public school teach-
ers and Gov. George D.
Clyde and the State
Legislature.
Early this year the
Utah Education Assn.,
a unit of the National Ed-
ucation Assn., asked that
there should be an in-
crease of $24.7 million in
state spending for the
public schools. The Legis-
lature granted $11.6 mil-
lion. Thereupon, the
UEA threatened that at
the opening of schools
this fall teacher members
would not return to their
posts.
*
In this case and in
others over the nation in
earlier cases, the teach-
ers' associations are care-
ful not to use the word
"strike" for such a re-
fusal to work. They use
"sanctions," which is a
United Nations word
meaning pressure or co-
ercion.
There are probably two
reasons why the word
"sanction" is used. One
is that the NEA does not
want to come under the
jurisdiction of the labor
laws. The other is to main-
tain its status as a pro-
fessional association.
For a long period of its
life of more than 100 years
the NEA was essentially
a professional organiza-
tion. It published informa-
tion helpful in the work
of a classroom teacher. It
worked for the improve-
ment of the teaching art.
*
But in recent years it
has consolidated itself in-
to a very powerful pres-
sure group working in
Washington and in states
for legislation favorable to
schools and teaching. It is
now essentially as much
a political organization as
is the AFL-CIO. And its
concentration has been on
federal aid for school con-
struction and teachers'
salaries.
This effort to get fed-
eral money for the schools,
to be distributed by the
U.S. Office of Education,
is the ostensible purpose
of the NEA. But it has
become clear that its real
objective is to take more
control of education away
from school boards and
official school admin-
istrators.
Its hope is that, by ex-
ploiting its close contact
with the U.S. Office of
Education, it will in fact
determine matters such as
working conditions, class
size, curriculum planning,
and teaching methods and
philosophy.
*
In short, it regards edu-
cation as too important a
matter to be left to the
direction of lay school
boards and legislatures. It
is dedicated to the idea of
government by an elite of
professional educator-poli-
ticians.
This effort to take over
a large area of school
management is resisted by
school boards and legisla-
tors. They see education
as something that is pro-
vided and its content de-
termined by parents and
citizens operating through
their elected representa-
tive school boards.
Essentially, the NEA's
objective is standardized
education directed and
controlled by a national
association and a federal
bureau. Such a concept of
mass education by an elite
is repugnant to the tradi-
tional American system of
local control.
Within the NEA's oper-
ating group and bureauc-
racy, plans are going
ahead rapidly. Two doc-
uments which are called
"developmental" and
"tentative" and which
show the nature of such
plans have come to the
attention of this writer.
One is called "Guidelines
for Professional Negotia-
tion"; the other, "Guide-
lines for Professional
Sanctions."
*
These are carefully la-
beled "intended only for
consideration of officials of
the NEA and affiliated
organizations." They are
"how-to-do-it" directives,
as clever and detailed as
the AFL-CIO's Committee
on Political Education
literature instructing its
members how to win elec-
tions in practical politics.
These are presumably
scheduled for action at the
July convention of the
NEA.
One reason for the ener-
getic actions of the NEA is
its fear that unless it gets
deeply into collective bar-
gaining, and coercive ac-
tion, its membership will
drift into the AFL-CIO
American Federation of
Teachers.
*
Utah will be a big test in
this new conflict. For that
state is politically conser-
vative, with strong feel-
ings about local control of
its schools. The two lead-
ing institutions of higher
learning, the University of
Utah and Brigham Young
University, are opposed to
the sanctions, as are the
school administrators and
the state government.
Nationally, this is a
power struggle between
local boards and profes-
sional associations. Money
is only incidental to the
controversy. It is a matter
of management and con-
trol of public schools.
