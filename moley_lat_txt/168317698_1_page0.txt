Court Curbs Unions and NLRB
in Foreign Flag Case Decision
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Moves by the National
Labor Relations Board to
sweep foreign-flag ves-
sels to the ample bosom
of federal jurisdiction
have been checked. The
Supreme Court has ruled
that the NLRB would ex-
ceed its powers and sub-
vert the intent of Con-
gress by imposing its will
regarding shipboard labor
relations and shoreside
picketing upon foreign-
flag ships.
This is a momentous de-
cision, involving as it does
a repudiation of a poli-
tically inspired power grab
by the federal govern-
ment, the elimination of
an issue of serious differ-
ence with friendly mari-
time nations, and the pros-
pect that hundreds of ships
available to the United
States in time of emer-
gency will remain so.
In 1961 the NLRB on a
petition from the National
Maritime Union ordered
elections on certain Hon-
duran ships. To support
the order that foreign sea-
men should be given the
benevolent advantage of
membership in an Ameri-
can union, the board con-
tended that a "contracts"
test should determine the
jurisdiction over a ship,
rather than its nationality
as shown by its flag.

Although the ships were
manned by foreign nation-
als and flew a foreign
flag, the facts that there
was American capital in-
volved in the foreign sub-
sidiary owning the vessels
and that the ships touched
U.S. ports made them can-
didates for organization by
our progressive and min-
istrant unions.
The solicitor general,
sensitive to the enormity
of political considerations
in the Kennedy adminis-
tration, made gracious
gestures to the NMU, a
strident AFL-CIO union.
While recognizing defense
and diplomatic considera-
tions and arguing against
the NLRB in this specific
case, he asked that the
court narrow its decision,
suggesting that American
jurisdiction might be ex-
tended to foreign-flag ves-
sels in other circum-
stances.
The Honduran company
and the Honduran union
as parties to the suits were
joined by five foreign na-
tions as amici curiae.
Their argument rested on
the venerable, universally
recognized law of the flag

where the ship is regis-
tered and whose flag it
flies has jurisdiction over
the management and dis-
cipline of ship and crew.
This principle was enun-
ciated in 1927 by the Per-
manent Court of Interna-
tional Justice and as
recently as 1960 by the In-
ternational Court in a case
in which the United States
argued as amicus curiae.
It is ironic that after 150
years the British in the
Honduran case upheld a
principle for which a
young and relatively weak
United States challenged
England in 1812.
To follow the "con-
tracts" criterion of the
NLRB and the maritime
unions could lead, as the
court observed, to a ludi-
crous exercise of U.S. pow-
er. The labor board, flex-
ing its jurisdictional bi-
ceps, made the boast that
an American-controlled
ship switching from the
Honduran, Panamanian, or
Liberian registries (where
for defense purposes it is
under the "effective con-
trol" of the United States),
could not escape: "Clearly,
she would find no sanctu-
ary in European registry
if those American contacts
remained otherwise
substantially unchanged."
The board contended,
"the particular flag or na-
tionality of the vessels
involved, as such, plays no
role in our determinations."
But the Supreme Court
in its unanimous decision
has brought the board up
short. The court points out
that to follow the theory
of contacts "to the ultimate
might require that the
board inquire into the in-
ternal discipline and order
of all foreign vessels call-
ing at American ports." It
recalls the admonition of
Chief Justice Marshall in
1804 in "the Charming Bet-
sy case" that "an act of
Congress ought never to
be construed to violate
the law of nations, if any
other possible construction
remains."
The court essentially re-
jects any case-by-case or
"contacts" approach sug-
gested by the Solicitor
General, thus smashing
the present theory of the
labor board. The court
found no evidence that
Congress intended the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act
to include foreign-flag
vessels manned by alien
crews.
That argument, the
court held, should be di-
rected to Congress and
not to the court.
Since any congressional
action favoring our mari-
time unions and the NLRB
at the expense of a time-
honored principle and
jeopardizing our defense
and relations with many
allies is remote, it appears
that our maritime unions
and the NLRB must con-
tent themselves with their
present awesome power.
