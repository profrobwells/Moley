Plea for a Brand New Tax Law
In the small town where
I grew up, I happened to
be present when a farmer
was buying some lumber
to be used in rebuilding
his house. He said rather
sadly as he paid the bill,
"When I finish this job I
will have a house almost
as good as a new one and
it will cost only a little bit
more."
I recalled this bit of
homespun economics
when I read an article in
the March 18 issue of U.S.
News & World Report. It
was contributed by Rene
Wormser, a distinguished
tax lawyer. He said in his
article that instead of try-
ing to reform the present
federal tax laws, Congress
should scrap the whole
contraption and provide
for the writing of a wholly
new statute.
★
This, he suggests,
should be written by a
nonpartisan commission of
experts, composed of
lawyers and accountants
and representatives of various
elements in our society.
The he makes
about the impossibility of
any real reform by
amendments is substantially
unanswerable. The
original law has been
patched by new legislation
and overlaid by administrative
rulings and court
decisions to the point at
which it is unintelligible
even to the expert.
It is like the overalls of a
thrifty farmer which have
been patched and re-
patched until the original
garment has almost disappeared.
Inconsistencies, obscure
passages, patently unfair
advantages, and other defects
abound. These are
the result of a never-ceasing
battle of wits between
lawyers and accountants
employed by taxpayers
and the experts who work
for the government. Tax-
payers find a crack in the
law and profit by it.
Thereupon, the Treasury
or Congress closes the gap.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Then the lawyers and
accountants find another
chink which the government
calls a loophole and
it is closed, and so on over
the half century since the
16th Amendment was ratified.
Wormser's suggestion
that Congress repeal the
entire statutory framework
and provide for a
new law is a singular
example of self-sacrifice
on his part. For, as he
Moley
says, he has earned a living
for 40 years interpreting
tax law for clients.
If the laws now on the
books are repealed he will
be like Othello, a man
whose "occupation's
gone." But he is willing to
have a new law in the
interest of a badly confused
and battered public.
To be sure, there are
practical difficulties in his
suggestion. A new law,
even if under our political
system it could be adopted,
would have to be interpreted.
There would be new
rulings and new court decisions
and new amendments,
and our children
and children's children
might well be as confused
as we are now. For the
pressures of political forces
and minority interests
would still operate.
Wormser's indictment
of the present tax system
points up an item which
seems to be neglected
when the cost of our
government is calculated,
an item which makes high
taxes necessary. The endless
battle between the
private and the public
experts costs a lot of money,
perhaps hundreds of
millions of dollars.
Most important is the
cost of the taxpayers, especially
the big ones, who
must not only permanently
maintain an immense
army of experts to prepare
their returns, but employ
lawyers and accountants
whose profession is to help
those taxpayers in their
battle with the experts in
the government. Then
there is the cost to the
government itself to
maintain its tax-collecting
machinery.
This is not only a cost in
money. It is a grave waste
in the use of highly skilled
manpower. If there were
more simplicity, thousands
of lawyers and accountants
in private practice
would be free to contribute
their great talents
to more productive labors.
★
Also there would be
need for fewer Treasury
employees, lawyers, and
judges.
The cost of our complex
tax system to businesses,
beyond the mere payment
of the tax bill, has been
pointed out by innumerable
examples. But a recent
and quite bizarre
example of distortion of
business judgment in order
to save on taxes concerns
the making of the
widely publicized motion
picture "Cleopatra."
Because of Elizabeth
Taylor's desire for a tax
benefit through payments
to her Swiss company, the
picture could not be made
in California. Then, because
of English tax benefits
on distribution of
the film, London was decided
upon. Disaster resulted
because of the
weather and its effect on
the star's health. Millions
were lost in this sitting
about.
The law may be an ass,
but it is a heavy eater.
