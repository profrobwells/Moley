Political and Economic Liberties
Involved in the Lockheed Dispute
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
From time to time
Americans should remind
themselves that the sys-
tem under which they live
is not that of majority rule
but of majority govern-
ment.
The distinction between
ruling and governing in
our common parlance is
not clear. But it means es-
sentially that a majority,
however preponderant, is
limited by rights accorded
to individuals and also to
groups of individuals
which bear the name of
minorities.
This principle has been
created over many gener-
ations in the evolution of
liberty. The most note-
worthy development of
this principle has been in
Anglo-American life.
For it is recognized that
an unreconstructed major-
ity can be as fearsome a
tyranny as the autocracy
of a despot.
It is this principle that
Lockheed has invoked in
refusing to participate in
the elections demanded by
the administration in certain
defense corporations on
the West Coast.
The background is this:
In the Lockheed company
there are workers who belong
to unions and other
workers who are not union
members. Over the
years Lockheed has recognized
unions as bargaining
units in matters affecting
pay and work conditions.
These matters have
been settled by peaceable
negotiation.
However, the unions
represented among Lockheed’s
employees made
demands that elections be
held in which a majority
would substantially compel
thousands of nonunion
members to pay union
dues and assessments to
governing powers of the
unions. This is what is
called an “agency shop.”
In intervening in this
dispute, the President appointed
a “fact-finding
board.” The chairman of
that board was Prof.
George W. Taylor, an
avowed exponent of compulsory
union membership.
In the Taylor report it
was recommended that
elections should be held in
the companies, and, if a
two-thirds majority appeared,
all employees would be required to pay
dues and assessments to
the unions. The provision
for a two-thirds rather
than a bare majority was a
concession, not to say a
sop to the companies.
The President then demanded
that the companies accept
the findings of
the fact-finding board, and
more recently the Defense
Department has indicated
that economic retaliation
will fall upon the companies
which do not accept
them.
Three companies agreed
to elections, in which all
failed to show a two-thirds
majority favorable to the
closed shop. Lockheed,
however, refused to agree
to an election.
Its position was that it
would not agree to the use
of economic force over
nonunion workers.
One of the major reasons
why nonunion members do
not want to make contributions—in
this case, an
estimated $1 million a year—is
that union funds in
these cases are used in political
campaigns. In short,
they do not want their
money to be used in support
of a party or its candidates
that they may oppose.
On this point the Supreme
Court has spoken
even through its most liberal
members. Last year in
the Looper case, which involved
railway employees,
Justice Black said:
“The stark fact is that
this act of Congress is being
used as a means to exact
money from these employees
to help get votes to
win elections for parties
and candidates and to support
doctrines they are
against. If this is Constitutional,
the First Amendment
is not the charter of
political and religious liberty
its sponsors believe it
to be.
“A violation of it, however
small, is, in my judgment,
prohibited by the
First Amendment and
should be stopped dead in
its tracks on its first appearance.”
It would seem that the
President and his administration
in taking a position
in this case are in violation
of this principle enunciated
by Black and the court.
It is this principle on
which Lockheed chose to
stand, and if political and
economic liberty mean
anything, Lockheed is
right.
