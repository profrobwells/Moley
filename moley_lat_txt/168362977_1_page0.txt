Germany's Chief-to-Be
Has Unique Experience
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When the venerable
Konrad Adenauer retires
this month as chancellor
of the Federal Republic of
Germany, he will be suc-
ceeded by a man with
unique professional exper-
ience.
Most heads of state, now
or in the recent past, have
been professional politi-
cians or soldiers with only
an amateur's knowledge
of economic affairs. Lud-
wig Erhard, now vice
chancellor and minister of
economic affairs, will need
no economic advisers. He
is a professional economist
himself.
Before he entered the
service of the government
he was the director of an
institute concerned with
marketing and other eco-
nomic matters. Since
Adenauer was so deeply
absorbed in diplomatic
and military affairs, Er-
hard was given the task of
economic recovery.
It is unnecessary to
explain in detail the max-
ims which have guided
Erhard's policies. Sound
and stable money, indivi-
dual enterprise, no cartels
or other contrived trade
restrictions, restraint
upon the demands of both
labor and stockholders,
hard work and confidence
in government have been
the prescription for prog-
ress long before socia-
lism, welfarism, and fas-
cism fuzzed up the think-
ing of Western nations.
*
With these well-known
principles and a popula-
tion chastened to the ne-
cessity of hard work, Er-
hard achieved a miracle of
recovery. There were soci-
alistic opponents, no
doubt, like the liberals
over here who tell conser-
vatives to "get with the
Twentieth Century." But
Erhard was not ashamed
to go back even before
Bismarck and find the
virtues which had made
Germany a great power.
But he realized that the
economic re-education of
the German people was
essential. They must not
only see the material re-
sults of his policies, they
must be made to under-
stand why they are essen-
tial.
*
Hence, from the begin-
ning of his service he has
published a great many
articles and speeches. He
has also produced two
books. The more recent of
these, "The Economics of
Success" (Van Nostrand:
$6.50), has just appeared
in the United States. This
is a collection of 54
articles and addresses
written over the period
from 1945 to 1962. In one
of these, "Voluntary In-
surance Against Social
Risks," Erhard explains
his favorite phrase, "social
market economy."
These three words are
significant. Erhard says
repeatedly that social wel-
fare and economic growth
are indivisible and inter-
dependent. Both should
involve individual free-
dom. "An autonomous so-
cial policy divorced from
the national economy is a
thing of the past and social
policy today must be in
tune with economic policy
Economic freedom
and entirely compulsory
insurance are not compati-
ble. Social security
provisions can only be
made on a highly indivi-
dual and selective basis."
*
Here Erhard sharply
disagrees with British So-
cialists and our own liber-
als who would put the cart
of welfare aid before the
horse of economic produc-
tion. He makes clear that
governments should make
sure that their own po-
licies are not the main
contributing factors in
creating the unfortunate.
Surely he would agree
that a rich country should
permit no real need for
individual help to go un-
fulfilled. But no country
can be rich enough to
operate on the principle
that there can be no
discrimination between
supplying needs and
wants.

The British Socialists
established their national
health service on the prin-
ciple that it should be free
for all. And following that
socialist lead, American
advocates of Medicare fa-
vor indiscriminate help.
The penalty for indiscri-
minate help is to overbur-
den the economy by exces-
sive taxation and to rot
the fiber of those who are
helped.
The jargon of our liberal
economists reeks with
false distinctions, such as
the "public" vs. the "pri-
vate" sector of the econo-
my. The highway and the
cars that roll over it are
cut from the same unit,
the whole production of
the nation. When we cut
the capacity of individuals
to buy cars, we also cut
the capacity of govern-
ment to build the high-
ways.
Erhard's philosophy has
delivered the goods. Our
liberals' case is based on
hypothetical benefits to
come.
