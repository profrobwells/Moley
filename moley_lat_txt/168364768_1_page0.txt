Work of American Ambassadors
President Kennedy's
foreign pilgrimage, as he
was warned before he left
the United States, proves
to be an exercise in
futility. There is little on
his agenda to negotiate,
and nobody to negotiate
with. Two of the heads of
state he is meeting will be
gone before snow falls.
Nobody knows who the
boss is in Italy. And
President De Gaulle has
already said all he intends
to say.
*
I suggest an exercise in
keeping with the Kennedy
line of duty as Chief
Executive which might be
productive. He might sit
down with the American
ambassadors in the
countries he is visiting
and discuss their problems
of administration: They
could tell him how many
people are nominally un-
der their jurisdiction,
what those people are
doing, if anything, and
how many could be sent
home or fired without
impairing the service.
The President might
also consider how much
this accumulation of per-
sonnel abroad is costing in
salaries, in upkeep, and in
the many new buildings
the United States has built
or rented to house them.
And, finally, he might
learn why these confused
multitudes abroad are so
largely responsible for our
confused foreign policy.

An American Secretary
of State is charged with
the immense task of administering the large bureau-
cracy which serves in
Washington and in the
ramifications of our
foreign service all over the
world. But since Charles
Evans Hughes and his two
successors, Kellogg and
Stimson, left the department, no one has really
served as an administrator. Hughes was not only
brilliantly successful in
diplomacy, but was a neat
and efficient administrator. He reorganized the
State Department and the
foreign service in his term

of office from 1921 to 1925.
He also secured the adoption of legislation which
provided for a trained
career service. Until Roosevelt was inaugurated in
1933, things went on pretty well, with a fairly small
number of employees who
knew what they were
doing and who was directing their activities.
*
However, when Cordell
Hull was invited to be
Secretary of State, he
imposed an amazing condition on his acceptance.
He said he wanted nothing to do with the actual
administration of the department. He wanted to
Moley
be free to preach his
favorite doctrine of free
trade.
In those days, when the
hitherto unbelievable was
the accepted order, Roosevelt agreed. He believed
he could operate the State
Department, the Treasury, and the Navy along
with his multifarious
duties as President. He
personally selected the
four assistant Secretaries
of State and the undersecretary. And from time to
time he dabbled in State
Department affairs in a
most confusing manner.
This went on to the day of
his death 12 years later.
Personnel proliferation
and confusion prevailed.
To make matters worse,
after the war Presidents,
by executive order or
otherwise, dumped into
the department several
jerry-built agencies which
had been set up during the
war years. Later the United States poured personnel abroad, military and
civilian, for all manner of
aid, uplift, and other services. All departments of the
government, from foreign
aid to the Treasury and
Agriculture and even Interior, have large contingents abroad. And, of
course, there are the military. All these assorted
people, while carrying out
directives from their respective departments in
Washington, by tradition
come under the general
jurisdiction of the accredited ambassador.
But he cannot cope with
such an accumulation.
With their sources of
information and direction
thousands of miles away,
these people do about
what they choose to do
and when, as is mostly the
case, there isn't anything
to do, they loaf, enjoy
themselves, and waste the
taxpayers' money.

It was recently made
very clear indeed that this
accumulation of staff grievously impairs the capacity of ambassadors to carry
on the work for which
ambassadors traditionally
have been sent abroad. It
was also made clear that
any ambassador, while
nominally responsible for
all the American personnel assigned to a given
country, is unable to supervise this mass of
people. This was vividly
brought out in a statement
presented to Sen. Jackson's subcommittee on national security staffing
and operations. Ellis O.
Briggs, a retired foreign-
service officer who has
been ambassador to
seven countries — the
Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Czechoslovakia, Korea, Peru, Brazil, and
Greece — very vehemently pointed out that ambassadors could operate more
efficiently with half the
staff. He also said that
appeals to Washington to
lighten the load of supernumeraries were most often ineffective.
