GOP Needs More Than Cuba Issue
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Every adult with even a
smattering of political un-
derstanding must realize
now, even if he failed to
know it at the time, that
when President Kennedy
shook a naked fist at
Khrushchev and Castro
last Oct. 22 he had one eye
upon the political cam-
paign then reaching its
final days.
It was well known for
months that Cuba was
building its
tribes a powerful base of
operations. And Republi-
can candidates for Con-
gress were making the
most of the issue and were
getting their point over to
the voters.

But with one speech
and certain deployments
of military force, together
with a series of letters to
and from Khrushchev, the
tide was turned. The Re-
publicans lost their major
issue and now they have
to operate on some other
basis.
This could be a reason
to opponents of the Ken-
nedy administration as they
look forward to 1964. If
they put all their eggs in
the Cuban hamper, they
may find that time,
chance, and some action
by the President will leave
them once more without
either the eggs or the
hamper.
★
Consumers’ trends, on
which many campaigns
have been based, may
prove to be unreliable.
Suppose, for example, that
a succeeding Soviet regime
should decide that Cuba
should be abandoned.
Or even that after un-
avoidable delay the Pres-
ident should decide to
abandon even its own
declarations to rid Cuba of
the Castro dictatorship.
The point is that there
are too many chances that
this issue may be resolved
before November, 1964,
and that Republican op-
position must base its case on
much broader grounds if it
exists at all.

We are prone in work
on Presidential
elections in the past to see
how they have been
decided by luck, chance,
or circumstances which
were not anticipated when
campaigning began. Ed-
ward J. Flynn, Franklin
D. Roosevelt’s smartest
and most resourceful poli-
tical adviser, once told me
that the Roosevelt domestic
policies had failed, and the
country was ready for a
change. But the Battle of
Britain began, and Pres-
ident Roosevelt deftly
turned all attention to the
necessity that the United
States should help its
beleaguered mother country.
★
The failures of the New
Deal were forgotten. That
old chestnut that we
should not change horses,
etc., was brought out and
Americans were made to
believe that we were in-
deed in the middle of some
stream and were dependent
upon keeping the
same horseman for the
years ahead.
Way back in 1896,
Bryan had the election
won in the summer, but
for economic reasons
which have never been
explained the price of
wheat began to rise in
September and farmers
forgot all about free silver
and elected McKinley.
In 1948 Dewey failed to
hail the achievements of
the 80th Congress and left
that worthy body naked
before the attacks of a
desperate Truman.
★
In 1960 Nixon in July
and August was the heir
of a popular President,
and a man named John F.
Kennedy was little known
except in Massachusetts
and the states where he
had campaigned for the
nomination. But the first
television debate gave
Kennedy the exposure he
needed, and Nixon in that
encounter, or for reasons which
need not enumerate, failed
to show his full capabilities.
That is why John F.
Kennedy and not Richard
Nixon is in the White
House.
It’s a long, long time
from now until the elec-
tion, and there will be
so ardent in anticipating
and predicting a win-
ning campaign. Should
another September
surprise occur, it is a
November requiem.
