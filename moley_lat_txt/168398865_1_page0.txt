Local Pressures Make
Large Federal Deficit
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A trite expression
among both cracker-barrel
and Ivy League philoso-
phers says that the Ameri-
can people get about as
good government as they
deserve. Considering what
we are getting in Wash-
ington and in many states
and cities, I cannot reach
such a melancholy judg-
ment about the American
people. I believe that with
the facts before them, they
would reach tolerably
sound conclusions.
★
It is a troublesome fact,
however, that people who
ought to know better pro-
mote their local interests
without considering the
long-term peril to the
credit of the United States
presented by the fiscal
irresponsibility of the
Kennedy administration
and its majority in Con-
gress.
I am specifically refer-
ring to people, mostly in
the business community,
who are known where
they live as "civic leaders."
They vigorously applaud
speeches at their local
Chambers of Commerce
and civic clubs condemn-
ing deficit spending and
the enlargement of the
federal government. But
you also find the same
people in Washington or
in their state capitals
urging appropriations for
some local improvement
which they say their com-
munity "needs" and can-
not pay for.

On one occasion, three
or four years ago, I made a
speech before the Chamber
of Commerce in a large
city. I said substantially
what I have summarized
above. The atmosphere
chilled and I looked at the
water pitcher on the table
before me, expecting to
see ice forming on the
surface. There was faint
applause when I finished,
and a short time after-
ward my syndicated col-
umn was thrown out of
the local newspaper. My
speech wasn't what they
came to hear.
A case in point is the
effort of Tulsa, Dallas, and
Fort Worth to "keep up
with Houston," which has
a ship channel linking it to
the gulf. The vigorous
efforts of local lobbies,
along with Oklahoma's re-
presentatives in Congress,
have got started a vast
federal project to bring
sea-going traffic up the
muddy Arkansas River to
Tulsa. And now Dallas
and Fort Worth want the
same access to the gulf, by
way of the slim Trinity
River. The Trinity project
would cost $911 million.

All these cities are rich,
prosperous, and growing.
Certainly, they would re-
ject any suggestion that
they are "depressed
areas," that would keep
new industries away. But,
they say, if Houston is a
seaport, they should be
seaports. Houston, howev-
er, is only about 50 miles
from salt water. Tulsa,
Dallas, and Fort Worth
are inland cities and enjoy
the advantages thereof.
They are closer to the
great centers of popula-
tion and their manufactu-
Moley
rers have shorter hauls to
their markets than Hous-
ton. A nation of prairie
seaports would be an eco-
nomic monstrosity.
★
The Houston ship chan-
nel was completed in 1914,
largely through the perso-
nal efforts and leadership
of Jesse Jones. It consisted
of the deepening of a
natural waterway which
had carried some com-
merce long before the
channel was deepened
and widened to accommo-
date the larger ships
which were being built at
the time. While the feder-
al government paid for the
dredging, the city and
county built and operate
the port facilities.
The Trinity River, on
which Dallas and Fort
Worth are casting eyes, is
navigable by nothing more
than canoes for the 300-
odd miles from the gulf.

Another factor comes
into the problem. When a
stream is made naviga-
ble it loses its value as a
source of potable water for
the people along its
course. Presumably, if the
Tulsa-Dallas-Fort Worth
dream should come true,
there would then be
screams for help about the
further problem of water
pollution.
These are simple exam-
ples of local pressures
which add further bur-
dens to the federal budget
and bring us nearer the
crisis in the national credit
which will injure every-
one.
There have been many
who, in contemplating the
course of events in this
country, wonder whether
we or any nation respon-
sive to popular caprice can
survive its own extrava-
gance. In short, can we
afford to be free?
