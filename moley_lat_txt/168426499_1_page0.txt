Extremists: U.S. Just
Has to Live With Them
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
What is needed is a bit
of common sense, historic-
al perspective, and politic-
al sophistication in ap-
praising what is called
"right-wing extremism."
Gov. Nelson Rockefel-
ler's and Sen. Jacob Javits'
alarm is highly incongru-
ous. For this "menace"
was there in 1962 when a
small group of irreconcil-
ables formed the Conserv-
ative Party for the ex-
press purpose of defeating
both the governor and the
senator. Both despite that
opposition, won smashing
majorities.
*
Sen. Tom Kuchel, whose
state of California is al-
leged to be swarming with
extremists, has recently
made long tirades about
them. But he won in 1962
by more than 800,000
while the more conserva-
tive Richard Nixon lost.
Two avowed California
Birchites lost their seats
in Congress in that elec-
tion.
Clearly, the present out-
bursts against the "radical
right" are not because ex-
tremists are, as Javits
says, "a threat to our po-
litical institutions" (which
in itself sounds pretty ex-
treme).
These outbursts are a
political gambit to embar-
rass the cause of countless
thousands who want Sen.
Barry Goldwater to run
for President. These par-
ticular anti-extremists are
of the same species as
those liberal Republicans
who denied Sen. Robert
Taft the nomination in
1940, 1948, and 1952.
*
On two of those occa-
sions the liberal Republi-
cans' substitute for Taft
lost. Gen. Dwight D. Ei-
senhower won because he
was a war hero, not be-
cause of the popularity of
the people who nomin-
ated him.
Further proof that this
is a political deployment
is provided by Democrats
who have inveighed
against extremists. As if a
party with the Presidency
and all its powers, two-
thirds of Congress, and
most of the state gover-
nors had anything to fear
from a handful of crack-
pots!
There is uncertainty
about what is meant by
extremism. Two kinds
seem to be confused. One
consists of lily-white and
rabid segregationists. The
other is a number of peo-
ple whose issues seem to
be abolishing the income
tax, getting out of the
United Nations, setting up
a super Supreme Court,
and impeaching Chief
Justice Earl Warren.
*
These groups may over-
lap, but they are far from
identical. For some ex-
treme segregationists, in-
cluding some members of
Congress, are in favor of
all the liberal policies of
the Kennedy administra-
tion with the exception of
civil rights.
Every movement of dis-
sent brings with it a fringe
of extremists. This one is
different only in direction.
Most such movements
have come from the "left."
Every party since 1789
has had to live with its
extremists. Every Pres-
ident from George Wash-
ington to John F. Kennedy
has had to contend with
them.
*
In the 1840's and 1850's
we had probably the most
fantastic collection. There
were the free-love collecti-
vist colonies and the anti-
meat people who, as
Emerson says in his "New
England Reformers," re-
fused to eat wheat which
had been grown with the
help of manure.
There were the wo-
men's rights females who
asserted their cause by
wearing pantaloons.
The Republic survived.
It survived in the 1880's
and 1890's when we had
Sockless Jerry Simpson,
Mrs. Lease the Kansas
pythoness, William How-
ard Harvey, and Pitchfork
Ben Tillman. And both the
Democratic and Republi-
can Parties lived with
these extremists and ac-
cepted their votes without
letting them run things.
In 1932 and 1933, in-
numerable people pes-
tered President Franklin
D. Roosevelt with fantas-
tic plans to save the nation
and the world. I can
testify, because I was
there, that Mr. Roosevelt
neither repudiated them
publicly nor was he their
captive.
In formulating and im-
plementing his policies in
his early and definitive
years, he depended upon
solid men in his adminis-
tration.
*
The extremists either
drifted away or were
given innocuous jobs. One
fire-eating ex-senator
from the South was set to
clipping newspapers. Mr.
Roosevelt believed that
politics is "assimilation,
not elimination."
There is a genuine
protest now, which falls
within my definition of
true conservatism, against
the domestic and foreign
policies of President Ken-
nedy and his supporters.
Most sound people who
can be counted in that
protest believe that a
change in policies can only
come through the Republi-
can Party.
Goldwater is their pre-
sent preference as a candl-
date. They, like Goldwa-
ter, are seeking Republi-
can unity rather than a
repetition of the disastrous
past.
