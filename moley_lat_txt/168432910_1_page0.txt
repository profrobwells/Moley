Man on Moon? Lend
an Ear to Khrushchev
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
When a man with a
notorious reputation as a
liar occasionally tells the
truth, he is greeted with
disbelief. In the case of the
Soviet government we
have come to be so accus-
tomed to appraising
everything it says as a
move in psychological
warfare that we are likely
to miss the truth and the
wisdom in Khrushchev's
statement about landing a
man on the moon.
And so most of official
Washington seems dis-
posed to regard Khrush-
chev's statement as anoth-
er false denial and to
proceed with this crazy
and expensive stunt. But
wiser heads in the admi-
nistration, some of whom
have had their reserva-
tions all along, are now
seeking a means of aban-
doning the man-on-the-
moon project by substitut-
ing another.

The moon plan, if it can
be called a plan, was
announced by President
Kennedy in May, 1961,
when nothing marred the
bliss of the official honey-
moon except the Bay of
Pigs.
Here was a young man
projected into the Pres-
idency who had never
been accustomed to count
the value of money, whose
abiding passion was to
establish his image as a
doer of big things, and
who believed that any-
thing was possible if en-
ough money was spent for
it.
The vicissitudes of age,
the imperfections of edu-
cation, the lagging in the
arts, the sprawl of cities,
unemployment, the
strained relations of two
different races-all these
could be cured if enough
millions could be assigned
to eradicating them.
He could count on more
than $90 billions in rev-
enue and no limit at all in
the government's capacity
to create money through
monetizing the national
debt. Literally, the sky
was not to be the limit of
his achievements.
After two years, when
the common sense of Con-
gress began to prevail and
the Kennedy programs for
Utopia began to bog down,
the President began to
trim his sails. The propo-
sal to join with the Soviet
to share the trip to the
moon was just as silly as
the original proposal to go
it alone.
He reasoned that half a
moon is better than none.
But the Soviet govern-
ment would have no part
in such a joint effort. For
Johnson
such a proposal would in
practice mean sharing all
of the secrets which the
respective intelligence
agencies of the two
governments have not al-
ready discovered.
I have always felt that
among all the New Fron-
tiersmen, the two fore-
most masters of comedy
have been Vice President
Lyndon Johnson and Sen
Clinton P. Anderson. Laid
end to end, the expres-
sions of these two states-
men would provide mater-
ial for several new ver-
sions of Alice in Wonder-
land.

Earlier this year the
Texas statesman warned
us that unless we proceed-
ed full scale with the moon
project, our children
would disport themselves
under a "Soviet moon."
After Khrushchev's state-
ment, Anderson said, "I
don't think we should let
Mr. Khrushchev deter-
mine our space policies."
Doesn't Anderson rea-
lize that ever since the
Sputnik that is exactly
what has been happening?
If the United States is
regarded abroad as a na-
tion of moneygrubbers,
the way to dissipate this
libel is to throw money
away. If we are regarded
over the world as a nation
with plain common sense,
the way to erase that idea
is to do senseless things.
