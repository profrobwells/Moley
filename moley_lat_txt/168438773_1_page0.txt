This Cow Is Useless but Sacred
President Kennedy
soberly declares that defi-
cit spending is designed to
create more taxable in-
come and thus ultimately
bring the budget into
balance. The sincerity of
this purpose can be chal-
lenged on many counts.
Here is one of many
examples.
His appointee as
ad-
ministrator of the Rural
Electrification Adminis-
tration has again sought
and secured by vote of the
House a large sum for his
agency. The amount au-
thorized in the agriculture
bill for this outfit is $425
million. This money will
be drawn from the Trea-
sury, which pays 16 or
more for it. Then the REA
lends this money to co-
operatives that once were
rural but now operate
mostly in large business
and non-rural areas.
The net loss to the
taxpayers is 500. For the
Treasury will pay $17
million for the money and
will receive in return $8.5
million.
With the money bor-
rowed, the co-operatives
build power plants and
transmission lines. Ninety-
seven per cent of their
activities compete with
those of private companies
which pay not only full
federal taxes but state and
local taxes as well. To get
money for their develop-
ment those private com-
panies pay upwards of 4 or
50% to private investors.
Year after year there
have been protests against
this irresponsible rigma-
role. A minority of House
members and Senators
have sought to halt this
subsidy. Magazine articles
and newspaper editorials
have brought out the
shocking facts. President
Eisenhower asked Con-
gress to stop the subsidy.
And here and there isolat-
ed co-operatives them-
selves have expressed
their hope that the co-ops
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
could be relieved of the
stigma of getting some-
thing for nothing and that
they might go on and
operate on their own. But
the sacred cow has grown
bigger and bigger and
more sleek.
Rep. Frank J. Becker of
Moley
New York offered an
amendment in the House
to the agricultural author-
ization act to eliminate the
$125 million. His amend-
ment was swamped by a
vote of 140 to 53.
In that debate a good
example of the operations
of the REA came out. In
Gainesville, Ga., there are
two private companies in
the cold-storage business.
They service the commu-
nity's main business of
storing poultry for ship-
ment. But another group
sought to crash in on this
business under the name
of the Jackson Electric
Membership Corp. It se-
cured a loan of $137.000
from the REA. This mo-
ney was then loaned to a
freezer company at 4% to
supply the equipment to
start the business. The
private companies in
Gainesville must pay taxes
and also pay 4 or more per
cent for their borrowings.
But the REA ignored their
protests.
What keeps this sort of
thing going? It is largely
the powerful lobby called
the National Rural Elec-
tric Co-operative Assn.
headed by one Clyde Ellis.
The Ellis machine hovers
over Congress constantly
when he is not out whip-
ping up the appetites of
the co-ops that are mem-
bers of the NRECA. His
constituency consists of
hundreds and hundreds of
co-ops over the nation. It
will betides the senator or
congressman who opposes
this aggregate political
power. Presidential candi-
dates, both Republican
and Democratic, pay tri-
bute to these "democratic"
economic institutions.
Newspapers that print
this article may well hear
from Ellis. For one of his
favorite weapons is letters
to the editor objecting
when a writer protests
about the further mainte-
nance of this sacred cow
and asking that his side be
printed. Since I have re-
peatedly exposed this out-
lay of taxpayers' money, I
occasionally get one of the
Ellis missives. Maybe I
will get one this time.
