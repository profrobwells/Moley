The Press Conference:
President Can't Lose
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I confess that I have
never had any interest in
attending a Presidential
press conference.
I have never attended
one, even when as a public
official assisting President
Franklin D. Roosevelt I
worked in and out of the
White House every day.
But since I have been
writing professionally on
public affairs for newspa-
pers and my favorite ma-
gazine for 30 years this
month, I have a number of
reflections and sugges-
tions which may be of
interest, even though
some newspapermen will
not agree with them.
*
Mr. Roosevelt staged his
press conferences before
there was direct exposure
to the public through
television or radio.
They were not even
reported in full in the
newspapers.
The major purpose that
the maestro had in mind
was to win the personal
affection of the working
newspaper reporters and
often to win them away
from their publishers.
The conferences were in
his office. The reporters
stood crowded together in
that limited space.
But close to his desk
where the Roosevelt favo-
rites who asked no embar-
rassing questions and
laughed loudly at the
President's habitually cor-
ny jokes.
The malcontent who
stood back in the ranks
would find his pointed
question answered by a
wise-crack.
At the present time it
should be realized by
television viewers that
this show is to display a
man who has all the
answers.
It is like the vaudeville
stunt of the man with a
magic memory who is also
a lightning calculator.
*
It is not a serious
exposition of over-all po-
licies.
No President should be
expected to know all the
answers. His job should
be to offer general policies
and principles--if he has
any. Specifics are to be
filled in by cabinet officers
or other subordinates.
Since the press is a
mighty arm of public
service and the White
House correspondents are
important fingers on that
arm, there should be some
concerted action by those
individuals, as a group and
an organization, to make
the Presidential confer-
ence worth their time.
They might, as an orga-
nized group, appoint a
small committee to receive
and sift written questions
from all their colleageus.
If necessary, the mem-
bers of this committee
could make up some of the
questions themselves.
The questions thus se-
lected and written should
be organized to bring out a
few very important sub-
jects which the President
should be expected to
explain.
*
The questions should
be submitted as the con-
sensus of the entire group
to the Presidential press
secretary in sufficient
time before the conference
to allow careful answers to
be prepared.
Perhaps, as has been
said, this would be dull.
But a President's utteran-
ces are not to provide
amusement.
They are to enlighten
the public.
It is time for the press-
and by this I mean pub-
lishers, editors and repor-
ters-to assert its right to
pertinent information. It is
time to stop being a pawn
in the executive's political
operations.
