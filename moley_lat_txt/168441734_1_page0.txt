Passamaquoddy: a Costly Dream
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Long, long ago, when
Franklin Delano Roose-
velt was a very little boy,
his parents built a summer
home on Campobello Is-
land in the Bay of Fundy.
There, as a youth, a
young man, and later a
national celebrity, he
spent many summer holi-
days.
No doubt, he pondered
deeply about the immense
tides which pushed their
way, obedient to lunar
influence, into Passama-
quoddy Bay.
In 1919 an imaginative
engineer, Dexter P. Coo-
per, also pondered on
these tremendous lunar
forces and conceived a
scheme to harness them
for the purpose of generat-
ing electricity. In 1921 Mr.
Roosevelt learned about
this, and his capricious
interest was instantly en-
gaged.
*
But illness, public ser-
vice and many other risky
schemes occupied his
mind in the years that
followed—schemes which
ranged from lobster pack-
ing to vending machines
and to quarter-in-the-slot
machines to take photo-
graphs in railway stations
and stores.
In 1935, when the Unit-
ed States Treasury was
subject to his speculative
imagination, the Passama-
quoddy project popped up
again, and Congress ap-
propriated $7 million to
start construction.
The next year, when
more funds, were needed,
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg’s
eloquence and massed
facts persuaded his col-
leagues in Congress to
drop the idea.
But in 1941 Roosevelt
induced the Federal Pow-
er Commission to study
the idea. That body flatly
said it was not practical.
In 1948 the governments
of the United States and
Canada asked the Interna-
tional Joint Commission to
reopen the consideration
of the Passamaquoddy
project.
The IJC answered that
detailed investigation was
needed. In 1956 Congress
appropriated $3 million
and Canada $300,000 for
such a study. In 1961 the
IJC reported that the
scheme was not feasible.
Presumably, the preoc-
cupation of the present
administration with the
moon led to thinking
about what good came
from the moon.
Then somebody thought
about tides, and then
somebody remembered
the old Passamaquoddy
project.
And so President Ken-
nedy asked the every-
ready Stewart Udall to try
once more with new plans.
The result is a report
issued in July of this year
which recommended the
authorization of the
project after favorable ne-
gotiations with Canada.
The thing looks very
simple. With every high
tide a vast amount of
water rushes up into Pas-
samaquoddy Bay through
various inlets from the
Bay of Fundy.
Then at low tide the
water rushes back into the
Bay of Fundy. Simply
provide dams for most of
the inlets and thus force
the water through a pas-
sage into the “upper pool.”
*
And when the tide goes
down below, let the water
escape through generators
—and presto, a large
amount of electric power.
The motion of the water
is not continuous, like the
flow of a river. The back
flow, which is supposed to
operate the generators,
lasts only a few hours a
day.
The project is estimated
to produce 1 million kilo-
watts of power one hour a
day. A subsidiary adjunct,
the Dickey, would provide
250,000 kilowatts.
The estimated cost
would be $24 per kilowatt
of capacity and 4 mills per
kilowatt hours at the site.
This would make Passa-
maquoddy the highest-
priced power in the coun-
try.
According to the esti-
mate, when the project is
completed the total cost,
with interest, would be
$1,025,466,000.
*
But since the estimates
of the Bureau of Reclama-
tion in several specific
completed projects have
in the past been only
about a third or a fourth of
the ultimate cost, this
billion-dollar estimate
must be taken with a large
grain of salt. A conserva-
tive estimate based upon
the past history of project
costs would put the ulti-
mate cost at $2 to $3
billion.
But just what benefit
will the consuming public
of New England get from
this lunar power brought
into their homes and
streets and factories in the
form of electricity? Pri-
vate utilities estimate that
36 times the amount of
additional power will be
needed than will be sup-
plied by Passamaquoddy.
This will be met by new
construction of dam and
atomic plants.
The scheme is a dream,
but, unlike most dreams, it
is a very expensive one.
