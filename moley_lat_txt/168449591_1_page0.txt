Wilson Hoist on Own
Philosophical Petard
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Edmund Wilson, noted
literary critic, writer ex-
traordinary, and friend of
famous novelists, has writ-
ten a new book for the
autumn trade. It is "The
Cold War and the Income
Tax: A Protest."
The first sentence is:
"Between the year 1946
and the year 1955, I did
not file any income tax
returns." This was not
because of deliberate civil
disobedience, as in the
case of Thoreau. It was
because of incredible ig-
norance of the law and
carelessness.
Then follows a self-
pitying tale of domestic
troubles and financial mis-
management. We are told
at great length of Wilson's
legal struggles after the
Internal Revenue Service
caught up with him. The
bureaucrats whom he
berates, it seems, were
doing what they are paid
for. Finally, a settlement
was made which permit-
ted him to liquidate the
debt from what he earns
over and above his living
expenses.
The polemic, however,
is largely devoted to the
extravagance of govern-
ment and its use of legal
power to collect taxes.
Wilson ends with this:
"Our country has become
today a huge blundering
power unit controlled
more and more by
bureaucracies whose rule
is making it more and
more difficult to carry on
the tradition of American
individualism."
I agree with those
words, but I have a
different concept of the
word "individualism." For
to me this nation is based
upon the paramount indi-
vidual, but that individual
has delegated to his
government the power to
protect one individual
against the trespass of
other individuals. Wilson
apparently believes that
an individual of such dis-
tinction as himself should
enjoy unusual liberty to
do as he pleases.
The cream of the jest is
that Wilson now cries out
against a system of
government which he,
throughout his working
life until his conflict with
the law, eagerly anticipat-
ed and actively promoted.
He calls himself "a former
leftist." He was an asso-
ciate editor of the New
Republic from 1926 to 1931
when that periodical was
crying out for more
government intervention
in the individual's private
life and affairs.
Wilson remained a dedi-
cated Socialist. Apparent-
ly he failed to see that the
liberal superstate which
he was promoting all that
time would inevitably end
in a bureaucratic state and
the extinction of indivi-
dual liberty. Presumably
he ignored the warnings
over the past 30 years of
people just as distin-
guished as he was, but
more perceptive, who pre-
dicted exactly what he has
now recognized and what
Tocqueville wrote 130
years ago.
In a long passage he
examines the Kennedy
budget for 1963-1964 and
finds that the vast expen-
ditures therein demanded
would compel every effort
to collect revenue that the
law allows. But that he is
still the liberal is shown by
his espousal of all sorts of
civil outlays.
He attributes all the evil
to military expenditures.
If he had taken the trouble
to examine the budgets
over the last 10 years, he
would have found that
civil, including welfare,
expenditures have in-
creased several times as
fast as those of the milita-
ry.
The biggest increase in
the bureaucracy in that
time has been in the
Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
