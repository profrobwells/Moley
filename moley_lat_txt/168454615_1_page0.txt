Eisenhower Impairs Popularity
The latest dispatch from
Gen. Eisenhower's winter
holiday headquarters is
that there will be no
political bulletins during
the holiday season. That is
why it is safe to publish
these comments in the
interim, before the ex-
president gives his bless-
ing to another Republican
prospect. For before I had
finished a piece which was
a comment on the Lodge
endorsement, out popped
the General with a nod at
Gov. Scranton.
The problem faced by a
poor political commenta-
tor these days is that
before he has time to
interpret the latest Eisen-
hower comment, the Gen-
eral reinterprets himself.
He had this habit during
his presidency. There
were printed in the tran-
scripts of his press confer-
ences so many incomplete
sentences that reporters
had to wait several hours
or days to determine ex-
actly what the President
said or didn't say.

His best-selling book
opens a broad avenue of
speculation. Therein we
find occasional expressions
of the Eisenhower
political ideology. Those
who read must be content
that his position is mid-
way between two extremes.
But he doesn't
define what he means by
extremes, so nobody
knows what is midway
between.
It is true that most
people's philosophy is
somewhere between communism, which is all-
government, and anarch-
ism, which is no-govern-
ment. But the right place
is never in the exact
center. A political position
when rightly arrived at is
determined by an assessment of the facts and a
rational appraisal of what
is right and proper. It is
determined by logic
coupled with the facts. It
is not determined by geometry.
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
I am sure that Gen.
Eisenhower does not want
to be a kingmaker. There
is nothing of John of
Gaunt or the Earl of
Warwick in his makeup.
What he says he wants is
a free-for-all fight for the
nomination. We may
agree with that. In fact,
that is the method that
has been followed in almost
every case except
when the General himself
was a candidate.
In those pre-convention
months of 1952 and 1956
he failed to invite candidates to oppose him. He
did seem to invite people
to oppose his faithful
friend and associate, Vice
President Nixon, in 1956.
That is when, by implication he permitted his subordinate, Harold Stassen,
to head a dump-Nixon
movement.
The suggestion of Henry
Cabot Lodge is still
wrapped in mysterious
interpretations and misinterpretations. Richard
Nixon, who believes that if
Lodge hadn't "helped"
him in 1960 he might have
won the election, visited
Gettysburg after that suggestion, presumably to get
a reinterpretation. Then
the General said, "now
both of us agreed that
we'd like to see him back
here because he is a
dynamic, vivacious man, a
leader type."
Nixon might have
agreed that Lodge was
dynamic in Harlem in the
campaign when he said
that there should be a
Negro in the cabinet and
thus lost two or three
southern states for the
ticket. But he was less
than dynamic during the
rest of the campaign and
deeply offended Republican leaders in the Midwest. Exactly whom
Lodge would be the "leader" of if he came back, no
one seems unable to discover.
But after the Lodge idea
was uninterpreted, Gov.
Scranton said that the
General had told him to
give "deeper thought" to
running for President. Accordingly, Scranton
plunged into deep thought
and said that Lodge would
be a good secretary of
state. A bit of deeper
thought might have
caused the governor to
realize that presidential
candidates--or, as in this
instance, individuals who
don't know whether or not
to run--certainly refrain
from picking cabinet
members in advance.
★
But it will take a lot
more than deep thinking
to project the image of
Scranton, a relative newcomer, over a nation in
which few people realize
that Scranton is a man as
well as a depressed city in
Pennsylvania.
One result of Gen.
Eisenhower's energies is
that there certainly will
be no dark horses by July.
For the light that beams
from Gettysburg will
shine on every possible
eligible Republican.
If the General during his
holiday in Palm Springs
will indulge in some deep
thought, he may realize
that this matter has become somewhat ridiculous. And that he has
fairly well impaired the
great popularity which he
has justly earned.
