Economy Line: 'Cuts for
You---but Not for Me'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There appears over a
tiny grave, it has been
said, a stone with this
inscription: "Little David.
Died at the age of 5
because of eating green
apples. His parents in
their grief have this conso-
lation: they never denied
him anything he wanted."
Perhaps when a mo-
nument is raised by the
Soviets over a busted and
ruined America, this in-
scription might be appro-
priate: "This nation, con-
ceived in liberty, went
broke because its people
used their liberty to elect
representatives and Pres-
idents who gave them
whatever they asked."
*
I shall be more precise.
That thrifty man who was
once Vice President, John
N. Garner, once told me:
"We can have a non-
political President, but we
can never have a non-
political Congress."
Those observations
came to mind as I noted
the shrieks and wails of
the two nominally Repub-
lican Sen. Kenneth Keat-
ing and Jacob Javits,
along with several Demo-
cratic members of the
House from New York,
when Defense Secretary
McNamara, under orders
from President Johnson,
proposed to terminate sev-
eral unnecessary installa-
tions in that state.
Sen. Edward M. Kenne-
dy, elected because of his
promise to "do more for
Massachusetts," and Sen.
Hugh Scott have protested
the closing of naval ship-
yards in Boston and Phi-
ladelphia. Thus, in line
before the pie counter,
Republicans and Demo-
crats are indistinguisha-
ble.
And we shall see whe-
ther President Johnson,
eyeing the fat electoral
votes in California, Mas-
sachusetts and New York,
will really carry through
these economies. It is one
thing to preach economy.
It is quite another to
practice it. For already
the administration has
backed away from some
proposals to cut defense
costs.
This uproar raises a
serious question. Are all
the billions in the defense
budget necessary to
protect us against an ene-
my in war, or are many of
them merely to make
work?
Our system of govern-
ment is so constituted that
only a President who is
willing to risk his re-
election can appreciably
cut federal expenses. Con-
gress won't do it because
the people back home
won't permit it. Chambers
of Commerce all over the
land love to listen to
speakers talking about
economy. But after the
applause has subsided,
resolutions are passed de-
manding that their sena-
tors and congressmen get
money for their commu-
nities.
Let us take a look at one
example, naval shipyards.
The Defense Depart-
ment was ready with
plans to close the Navy's
shipyards in Boston, New
York, Philadelphia and
San Francisco. Two
studies by reliable firms—
one by Ernst and Ernst,
and another by Arthur
Anderson and Co.—re-
ported that the work done
by naval shipyards could
be done at much less cost
in private shipyards.
Some of these private
yards have been losing
money because of govern-
ment competition. When
they are permitted to do
government work, their
profits are taxable and
return money to the
government.
*
But these naval yards,
antique monuments to the
past and at present
evidences of political expe-
diency, have now been
made exempt from the so-
called "economy drive" of
the President.
The naval complex,
with an estimated net
worth of $5 billion, con-
sists of 11 yards. All these
are located on highly va-
luable land. None pays a
dime to the communities
in taxes. Where naval
yards were closed, new
private industries would
buy and occupy those
sites, with new jobs and
tax returns to the public.
And the Navy's work
would be efficiently done.
The comptroller general
of the United States has
issued report after report
making recommendations
which, if adopted, would
save vast sums. Secretary
McNamara has in his
office equally worthy
plans to economize. But
politics has up to now
frustrated these econo-
mies.
