The Decline and Fall
of deLesseps Morrison
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a primary contest for
the governorship of Lou-
isiana on Dec. 7 deLesseps
S. Morrison had a plurali-
ty of 142,000. On Jan. 11 in
a run-off primary he lost
to John J. McKeithen by
44,000.
Morrison's name was as
well known in Louisiana
as was that of John F.
Kennedy in Massachusetts
in 1960. He had served
from 1946 to 1961 as
mayor of New Orleans. He
left that office in the latter
year to accept an appoint-
ment by President Kenne-
dy as ambassador to the
Organization of American
States.
Twice, while mayor, he
had been an unsuccessful
candidate for governor of
Louisiana.
McKeithen, the winner
in the January primary,
prior to his campaign for
governor was quite un-
known except in the
northeastern corner of the
state.
To many observers over
the nation this result was
an incredible upset. But it
becomes quite understand-
able when viewed in the
Alice-in-Wonderland con-
text of Louisiana politics.
This is how an old
friend of mine, Scott Wil-
son of New Orleans, ex-
plains Morrison's down-
fall. Wilson is one of the
most sophisticated and
successful political profes-
sionals I have ever known.
In 1946 Morrison was a
very young man, new to
politics, but Wilson man-
aged to make him reform
mayor. Three successive
times he managed Morri-
son's campaigns for re-
election. Because of a
disagreement with Morri-
son in 1961, he successful-
ly managed the campaign
of the incumbent mayor,
whom Morrison opposed.
In 1963 Morrison se-
cured Wilson's help in
planning his campaign for
governor. But again there
was a disagreement, and
Wilson was induced to
care for McKeithen's for-
tunes in the vital New
Orleans area. By his ef-
forts, McKeithen was able
to win second place in the
first primary. After that,
segregationist leaders
moved into McKeithen's
operations, and Wilson
moved out.
Here is how Wilson
explains what happened:
Morrison's association
with the Kennedy admi-
nistration and his views
on integration meant that
in the first primary he had
the Negro vote, en bloc --
95%. This led McKeithen
in his second primary
campaign, with which
Wilson had practically no
connection, to concentrate
on this one issue, charging
that he was really running
against the NAACP.
White racists like Lean-
der Perez moved into the
campaign in southern
Louisiana. And, as is al-
ways the case, a solid bloc
of votes on one side tended
to create a solid bloc of
opposition. And so in New
Orleans the racial issue,
which had not been prom-
inent for a long time, came
very much alive in opposi-
tion to Morrison.
Wilson had warned
Morrison of this several
months ago. He told him
that he could win the first
primary, but that "any-
body" could beat him in
the second primary. And
Wilson adds now that
"anybody did beat him."
Wilson concludes that in
the general election on
March 3, Charlton H.
Lyons of Shreveport, a
good man and a Republi-
can, will get a big vote
from people who dislike
the segregationist extre-
mists who surrounded Mc-
Keithen in the second
primary.
