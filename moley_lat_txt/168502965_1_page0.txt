Goldwater's Proposals for TVA
Would End 'Creeping Socialism'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Sen. Barry Goldwater
seems to have sent a
tremor over the land by
suggesting that the Ten-
nèssée Valley Authority
be liquidated. The full
statement of his plan is
wholly reasonable, but the
very suggestion of tamper-
ing with this institution
troubles his friends and
excites his enemies.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisen-
hower who, as I remem-
her, called the TVA
"creeping socialism" now
furrows his brow because
any candidate would
touch what has become
"an emotional way of life."
The TVA is just that.
Schools and colleges in
which the curriculums
show sad neglect of basic
American history and An-
glo-American political in-
stitutions arrange visits to
the valley for whole clas-
ses. There, in the presence
of roaring generators, fall-
ing waters, and black
smoke, every head is
bowed before what is
miscalled "démocracy in
action."

In the 1932 campaign
Franklin D. Roosevelt
merely said that he fa-
vored federal develop-
ment of the World War I
installation at Muscle
Shoals on the Tennessee
River. The vast paterna-
lism that emerged the
next year was the idea of
Sen. George Norris.
When Roosevelt was
approached with the idea
that, after the federal
government had built the
dam and generators, the
power should be sold to
the tax-paying, investor-
owned power companies
in the area, he said, "See
George Norris. It's his
baby."
The incomplete installa-
tion at Muscle Shoals had
been built during World
War I to provide nitrogen
for war use. It was not
intended to be used as a
monopolistic government
business. But when Mr.
Roosevelt launched the
project in 1933 he said it
"would lead to complete
national planning.. in-
volving many states and
the future lives and wel-
fare of millions."
Four years later, Mr.
Roosevelt was so enthusi-
astic about this "baby"
that he proposed that the
whole nation be marked
out in valley authorities
which would, in fact, large-
ly supersede the states.
But Congress killed propo-
sals for a Missouri Valley
Authority and a Columbia
Valley Administration.
The basic TVA act itself
is a curious document. It
required that the mem-
bers of the five man
governing board should be
in sympathy with the
purposes of the institution
purposes which in their
aggregate were the crea-
tion of a vast welfare
state. A member could be
removed for "contumacy,"
an old legal term which
meant, as Roosevelt used
it, disagreeing with the
President or with fellow
members.
The constitutional justi-
fication was alleged to be
flood control, reforesta-
tion, navagation and other
federal concerns.
As it stands, the TVA is
in reality a government
within and largely inde-
pendent of the federal
government. Many of its
activities are duplications
of functions already pro-
vided for in federal de-
partments. Federal money
was lent at 1% interest.
And recently the. TVA
was empowered to issue
its own bonds, a practice
which was soundly con-
demned by the comptrol-
ler general of the United
States. This would enable
the TVA to expand far
beyond its original boun-
daries.
Despite the vast expen-
ditures for the alleged
purpose of navigation,
there has been no com-
mensurate increase in
river-born commerce. And
if there should be, it would
greatly increase the dis-
tress of the railroads. As
far as flood control is
concerned, the Army en-
gineers estimated that the
damage from floods would
normally equal in cost
only half the amount
spent to prevent them.

The monopoly almost
immediately drove the pri-
vate power companies
from the area. No busi-
ness can compete with a
federal subsidy.
Goldwater's suggestions
are that such functions as
are duplications of acti-
vities in other depart-
ments should be turned
over to those departments.
Also, he says that TVA
activities which have no
counterparts should be
sold and put under strict
government supervision
as to rates, etc. No one in
the valley, Goldwater ex-
plains, would lose any of
the services they already
have. And government
would be gotten out of
matters which should nev-
er have been assumed..
