Richard Nixon Points a Sensible
Way to Solution of Rights Crisis
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A sufficient number of
Republicans in the House
of Representatives helped
the liberal Democrats to
enact a civil rights bill
which will, if enforced,
through the thrust of
governmental police pow-
er, deny basic liberties to
the American people.
And if it is not enforced,
it will on its face be a
dishonest, irresponsible
piece of legislation. I am
sure that Republicans who
voted against reasonable
amendments and for the
final passage of the bill
knew this.
But they were moved
by several considerations,
none of which adds luster
to the Republican Party.
One such consideration
was to pass the buck to the
Senate, which now must
consider the bill; to Pres-
ident Johnson, who will be
expected to enforce it; and
to the Supreme Court,
which will have to forsake
all precedents to uphold
the highly dubious use of
the commerce clause of
the Constitution.

There was also the cal-
culation by Republican
members of getting votes
in their districts from
people whose expectations
have been excited beyond
any hope of fulfillment.
Such considerations belie
the pious claims in most
Lincoln Day speeches of
kinship with the honest
and realistic Abraham
Lincoln.
One Republican leader
on Feb. 12 looked beyond
the narrow interests of
districts and states to the
concerns of all the nation's
people, Negro and white
alike. This was Richard
Nixon, speaking at a rally
in Cincinnati.
He said what a great
many Americans of both
races are beginning to
think amid the hatreds,
passions, and political pan-
dering that this issue has
created. But they hesitate
to voice their convictions
lest their neighbors accuse
them of bias and intoler-
ance.
Nixon in effect told the
Republicans that it is time
for responsible people to
"take over from the extre-
mists." And, by inference,
that Republicans must do
the taking over, since De-
mocrats are in a bitter
struggle among them-
selves.
"In this election year,"
he said, "Republicans will
be urged by some to out-
promise the Johnson ad-
ministration on civil rights
in the hope of political
gain.
"I am completely op-
posed to this kind of polit-
ical demagoguery. Making
promises that cannot
be kept — raising hopes
that can't be realized—are
the cruelest hoaxes that
can be perpetrated on a
minority group that has
suffered from such tactics
for a hundred years."
Nixon said further that
the Republican Party
should stand firmly on a
number of principles:
"The encouragement of
disrespect for law through
mass demonstrations, boy-
cotts and violation of
property rights in the long
run harms, rather than
helps, the cause of civil
rights. Some justify such
tactics on the ground that
they may hasten the pas-
sage of laws. But, at the
same time, these tactics
destroy the will of the
people to obey those laws.
"We disapprove of the
spectacle of public officials
lending the prestige of
their office to extra-legal
pressures on the part of
any minority or majority
group. This encourage-
ment of disregard for law
and for the rights of other
people and other minor-
ities will plague the cause
of better understanding
for years to come . . .
"We reject the idea that
the way to reduce high
Negro unemployment is to
increase white unemploy-
ment. We stand for a
program that will increase
job opportunities for all
Americans.
"We oppose segregation
in our schools either by
law or in fact. But this
problem must be dealt
with in an orderly transi-
tion. We believe it is
detrimental to both Negro
and white children to
uproot them from their
communities and to haul
them from one school to
another in order to force
integration in an artificial
and unworkable manner."

There are plenty of
Republican demagogues to
whom Nixon's comments
specifically apply. Some of
them hold high office in
heavily Democratic com-
munities by outdoing
Democrats in their zeal to
win minority groups.
They do not, in their
oratory, represent either a
national consensus or a
majority of the Republi-
can Party in the nation.
Whatever may be Rich-
ard Nixon's future in
political or public life, he
has served a fine purpose
by voicing these moderate
sentiments in the midst of
confusion, claptrap and
political insincerity. For
this he deserves a high
place in his party and the
nation.
