Nixon's Sound Stand
on Vice Presidency
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
No Vice President since
1789 so constructively en-
larged the status of that
office and made it more
useful than did Richard M.
Nixon.
Moreover, he served in
that office when the Pres-
ident was gravely ill and
vital questions arose about
the succession "in case,"
as the Constitution says,
"of the removal of the
President from office, or of
his death, resignation, or
inability to discharge the
powers and duties of the
said office."

Nixon's views about
what should be done when
the Vice Presidency is
vacant are highly per-
tinent to the present dis-
cussion of that subject.
For the Vice Presidency
has been vacant more
often than after a Pres-
ident's death. One Vice
President, John C. Cal-
houn, resigned and one,
Garrett A. Hobart, died in
office.
In a recent magazine
article Nixon dismisses as
impractical the three most
prominent suggestions
about changing the law of
succession.
One of these is to return
to the old plan, under
which the secretary of
state and other Cabinet
officers stood next in line.
Secretaries of state are
not usually chosen be-
cause of their executive
ability. The one who
served longest, Cordell
Hull, was appointed be-
cause of his "idealism," so
Roosevelt said. And when
it was suggested in 1940
that Hull be nominated to
succeed him, Roosevelt
dismissed the idea be-
cause, he said, Hull was a
very incompetent admi-
nistrator.

In recent times John
Hay, Elihu Root and
Charles Evans Hughes
might have been excellent
Presidents, but they were
exceptions. If Wilson and
Marshall had died, Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan
would have succeeded to
the presidency, despite his
three defeats as a candi-
date for President.
Another suggestion
would have the President
appoint a new Vice Pres-
ident, subject to confirma-
tion by Congress. But
suppose Congress should
be controlled by the oppo-
sition party? The same
objections would apply to
direct election of a new
Vice President by Con-
gress.
Sen. Keating's idea is to
elect two Vice Presidents
every four years. This is
preposterous. Capricious
reasons now dictate the
selection of Vice Presiden-
tial candidates. The idea
of nominating two would
further downgrade the
office at a time when it
needs to be given more
prestige.
Nixon suggests the fol-
lowing qualifications for a
Vice President
"He should be a man
qualified to be President.
"He should be a full-
time Vice President with
no other official duties.
"He should be a mem-
ber of the same political
party as the President.
"He should have a poli-
tical philosophy which is
close to that of the Pres-
ident, particularly in the
field of foreign affairs.
"He should be personal-
ly acceptable to the Pres-
ident, but since he may
potentially hold the high-
est office in the land, his
selection should reflect the
elective, rather than the
appointive, process."
To meet these require-
ments, Nixon suggests this
constitutional amendment:
"Within 30 days aft-
er a vacancy occurs in
the office of Vice Pres-
ident, either because of
death, removal, or the
elevation of the incumbent
to the Presidency, the
President shall reconvene
the Electoral College for
the purpose of electing a
Vice President of the Unit-
ed States."
In support of this plan
Nixon notes that the elec-
tors in the various states
now perform a purely
routine duty. They vote
for the party candidates
who carried their respec-
tive states and in doing so
elected them.
Hence, the party organi-
zations now nominate
electors with no considera-
tion of their qualifications.
But with this change,
Nixon says, the personnel
of the Electoral College
would be upgraded. And
since they were elected on
the same ticket with the
Vice Presidential candi-
date, they would be likely
to follow the recommenda-
tion of the new President.
