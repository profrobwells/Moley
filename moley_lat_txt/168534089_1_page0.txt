Barry Goldwater and His Critics
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
There are certain fac-
tors connected with the
widely reported decline in
the fortunes of Sen. Barry
Goldwater which some of
his critics might well con-
sider. These critics that I
have in mind are not
liberal Democrats who
have opposed Goldwater
and his ideas for years.
No. These new critics
are former admirers who
havÄ— raised doubts about
him since Nov. 22. Some
are conservative people
who find fault with the
way he is campaigning
and with some of his
reported statements. Some
are Republicans who for
the last four years have
been calling for a clear
and positive choice be-
tween the parties in 1964.
Others are organization
party leaders, in public
and out, who are looking
for a less "controversial"
candidate. And some are
businessmen who have
been taken in by President
Johnson's corny platitudes
and his phony gestures
toward economy.
All these "summer sol-
diers" and sunshine pa-
triots" have in the past
been applauding sen-
timents identical with
those that Goldwater is
uttering now. Within the
circle of critics there are
many Republicans in of-
fice who have been the
beneficiaries over the
years of Goldwater's tire-
less campaigning for them
and for the Republican
Party to which they be-
long.
These people should
realize that it was inevita-
ble that some time before
the convention in July the
earlier steady rise in Gold-
water sentiment would
level off or take a tempor-
ary dip.
This has happened in
other years and to other
public figures before
George Gallup was born
and before polling had
become a thriving indus-
try. In 1892, when Pres-
ident Harrison was defeat-
ed for re-election, Gov.
William McKinley of Ohio
was the most popular
Republican in the nation
and seemed to be on his
way to the Presidency.
But a year or so later, he
found himself penniless
because he had innocently
endorsed a friend's notes.
He was ridiculed from
coast to coast. But his
fortunes recovered and he
Goldwater
was nominated and elect-
ed.
The occasion for the
inevitable dip in Goldwa-
ter's popularity was the
death of President Kenne-
dy. Goldwater critics
sprang up everywhere,
and now everything he
says is lint-picked.
His decision when he
announced his candidacy,
however, was that he
would avoid the double-
talk which is the habit of
candidates and continue to
speak his mind as before.
He was and is more
concerned with the stimu-
lation of conservative
thinking than he is with
getting the nomination.
His supporters will have
to attend to the mustering
of a majority at the July
convention. Because he is
mainly concerned with a
Republican victory in
November, he is not at-
tacking any of his rivals
for the nomination, an
example which Gov. Nel-
son A. Rockefeller might
well emulate. For the
party must live, and its
members should support
the nominee.
Moreover, some of the
statements for which
Goldwater has been criti-
cized are, when closely
examined, sound and true.
There are two exam-
ples. He said that our
missiles are unreliable.
This is true when it is
considered that with the
development of missiles
the more tested and accur-
ate manned aircraft have
been neglected.
Verification of Goldwa-
ter's position on this has
since been supplied by
scientists and such milita-
ry experts as Hanson
Baldwin and Air Force
Chief of Staff Curtis E.
LeMay.
Gen. Eisenhower won no
laurels as a logician when
he said in criticism of
Goldwater that our mis-
siles are the best in the
world. That was merely
begging the question.
It was reported that
Goldwater called for a
blockade of Cuba after the
Guantanamo incident.
And so the State Depart-
ment cried out that a
blockade is "an act of
war." But Goldwater did
not advocate an act of
war. He said:
"The long-discussed
blockade of subversion
from Cuba and the block-
ade of military materials
going into Cuba must be
finally and fully applied."
Later he said that such
a blockade would extend
to "anything that is going
in there" which Cuba can
use "to maintain commu-
nism and to spread it
through this hemisphere."
If this had been done
when the threat appeared
in 1961, there would have
been no missile crisis in
1962 and infinitely fewer
upsets in Latin America.
We cannot have a candi-
date with whom every
Republican can agree on
every detail. But if the
two-party system is to
operate, a clear choice is
needed. Goldwater is sim-
ply asking whether the
Republican Party wants
such a choice.
