Let's Abandon Folksy
Approach in Campaign
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The New Hampshire
primary campaign offers
little enlightenment so far
as this year's Presidential
campaign is concerned.
But it teaches a very se-
vere lesson in what is
called the art of politics.
This might be pondered by
candidates, political man-
agers, and the voting pub-
lic generally.
The method of cam-
paigning adopted by Sen.
Barry Goldwater and Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller
failed in the pragmatic
test. It didn't work. A
silent man on the other
side of the world won. His
cause was carried on by
subordinate workers on
the spot.
The routine adopted by
Rockefeller and Goldwa-
ter with the voters—and
with many who were not
voters at all—was face-to-
face and palm-to-palm.
Detached austerity with
a gesture of dignity won in
the Granite State. Convi-
viality failed. Goldwater
would have done better if
he had remained on the
Senate floor or in the patio
of his home in Phoenix.
And his luster would have
been maintained if, as
some friends advised, he
had skipped that primary
entirely.
This wretched pattern
of cadging votes was ap-
parently set by Rockefel-
ler. For in two campaigns
for governor of New York
he used it freely.
But since his two op-
ponents on those occasions
were weak candidates and
Rockefeller money flowed
like water, it's doubtful
that the walkie-talkie,
handshaking, and eating
and drinking (coffee) busi-
ness had much effect upon
New York voters.
Rockefeller, however,
didn't originate the folksy
approach. It has been used
for generations by candi-
dates for sheriff, for coun-
cilman, and for the keep-
ership of the dog pound.
It is not uncommon with
candidates for Congress.
The Rockefeller routine
goes far beyond handshak-
ing and broad smiles. His
has been a manifestation
of gastronomic prowess. In
his New York campaigns
for governor, in order to
show that his wealth had
not spoiled him, he ate
freely of pizzas, blintzes,
bagels, hot dogs and ham-
burgers.
In New Hampshire the
menu was somewhat dif-
ferent. There were hot
dogs and hamburgers, but
also ice cream sodas and
gallons of coffee.
By necessity, Goldwater
somewhat awkwardly fol-
lowed Rockefeller's exam-
ple. I don't know whether
the Arizona senator ate
chili con carne when he
was running for office in
his state. But in New
Hampshire the hands he
had to grasp were colder.
As the dreary weeks
passed, he gave ample
evidence that he cared
less and less for what he
was doing.
The serious point in this
is that these men were
already holders of high
office. They were running
for the most exalted elec-
tive office in the world.
Certain evidences of digni-
ty are required in such a
contest.
*
Jackson, Lincoln, Hayes
and Cleveland won with-
out this sort of activity.
Most candidates merely
remained at home. It was
William Jennings Bryan
who started the business
of running all over the
country campaigning. He
didn't win.
Among the many mo-
tives which moved the
frosty voters of New
Hampshire, there might
have been a sense of the
proprieties, of proportion,
and a concept of what
kind of behavior suits an
individual who has qualifi-
cations for the Presidency.
