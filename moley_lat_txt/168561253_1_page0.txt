Revitalization of GOP
in South Due to Youth
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Last week I was present
at the Southern Confer-
ence of Young Republi-
cans in Atlanta. As most
people know, the Young
Republicans are an
authentic national politi-
cal organization. It has
state and college groups
with a full roster of offi-
cers. As a federation it
holds lively annual na-
tional conventions.
I have a deep interest in
these young people, for if
the Republican Party—if
the two-party system—is
to have a vital future, it
must come from young
men and women. For in
most states the senior
Republicans have per-
mitted their organizations
to decline and disinte-
grate.

In a very few years,
perhaps before the 1968
Presidential election,
these young people will
take over much of the
GOP. This is especially
true of the South, where
Republican organizations
were either merely nom-
inal or non-existent.
In my talks with these
young people in Atlanta, I
was especially concerned
in learning the motives,
point of view, and spirit
which have made them
such a potential political
force.
They largely come from
the fast-growing indus-
trial areas of the South.
Their parents and grand-
parents were Democrats.
With the dawn of political
consciousness they have
realized that the old Dem-
ocratic habits in their area
are a bar to progress. They
are in revolt against an an-
cient and meaningless po-
litical regime. That in
itself is a mark of progres-
sive thought.

They anticipate playing
a part in a new industrial,
social, and political era.
They believe that growth
can come only as state and
local responsibility can be
vitalized. And hence they
resent the paternalism
and power of the federal
government in Washing-
ton.
They are only moder-
ately concerned with the
racial issue in their states.
They tell me that they
regard the present ten-
sions over civil rights as a
fight within the Demo-
cratic Party and they
want no part of it.
In the audience to
which I offered a few
words of advice I noticed
several young Negroes
who were working side by
side with their white
friends in planning to get
out a Republican vote.
They are far removed
from what is called ex-
tremism. One young man
who came to my room to
talk told me that he be-
longed to the John Birch
Society and that therefore
he felt he was ignored by
the other people at the
conference.
In general, the people
there have already
learned to be practical,
working party members.
They have no intention of
waiting years to attain
power. They pursue no
Utopias and tilt at no
ideological windmills.
In my remarks, the
most enthusiastic re-
sponse I had was when
I told them that as
Republicans they were
creating a brand new
party in their states. "You
have no Republican past
to haunt you. You are
blazing a new trail,
creating a new party, the
future of which you and
only you will shape."

Napoleon said that ev-
ery French soldier carried
a marshal's baton in his
knapsack. These young
people have personal am-
bitions as well as concern
for creating a new party.
I was most impressed by
the fact that in their
round tables and programs
the emphasis was much
less upon issues and ideo-
logy than upon political
methods and organization.
They well know that the
first lesson in politics is
that while good candi-
dates and issues are im-
portant, victory comes
only with superior orga-
nization. Getting out the
vote is of first concern in
political leadership.
Republicans every-
where might well note
this political revolution in
the South. The destiny of
the party may well depend
upon these young, dedi-
cated people. The future is
what they will make of it.
