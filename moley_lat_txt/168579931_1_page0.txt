FBI's Hoover Lauded
as 'Indispensable Man'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In March, 1933, J. Edgar
Hoover had been director
of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for nine
years. During that time
he had purged that
agency of the politics and
incompetence which were
the inheritance from the
Harry Dougherty-Hard-
ing years.
He had well under way
a records and identifica-
tion system which later
became the best in the
world. He had initiated a
rigid recruiting and
training program for his
operatives. He had solved
seemingly insoluble
crimes and had earned
national respect and ac-
claim.
But even before Fran-
klin D. Roosevelt's inau-
guration there were sev-
eral notable figures in the
Democratic Party who
had candidates for Hoo-
ver's job. Some of these
were police chiefs, the pets
of city Democratic ma-
chines.
The pressure was on for
a change and Louis Howe,
the President's secretary,
became the politicians'
advocate in the White
House.
Louis, who urged
Roosevelt to make the
change, conceived himself
to have some expertise in
criminal law enforcement,
largely because he was a
constant reader of detec-
tive stories.
There were other anti-
Hoover influences at
work. A new member of
the administration brought
to me a disgruntled for-
mer operative one eve-
ning.

This man's complaint
was that Hoover was a
tyrannical martinet. It
seemed that Hoover, dis-
satisfied with his work
in the East, had moved
him summarily to the state
of Washington. As I lis-
tened, I drew the conclu-
sion that Hoover was oper-
ating under rules of strict
and impersonal discipline.
This obviously was exactly
what was essential in such
an organization. By-pass-
ing Howe, I gave this
opinion to the new Pres-
ident.
Meanwhile, Mr. Roose-
velt was immersed during
those early days in the
bank crisis and holiday.
This bought time for Hoo-
ver.
Homer Cummings of
Connecticut was put in
charge of the Justice De-
partment. Cummings was
a very able lawyer and a
shrewd judge of men. He
quietly evaluated the si-
tuation in the FBI and
concluded that Hoover
was indispensable. Cum-
mings was also a political
power in his own right.
And so, from that time
on, Hoover was supported
by a long succession of
Presidents and attorneys
general and respect for
him spread through both
parties in Congress.
In all these 40 years—
his anniversary was last
Sunday—he has come to
be regarded as a national
institution. Whenever and
wherever law enforce-
ment fails, there is a call
for the FBI. Its efficiency
is now legendary.

A few simple rules,
aside from Hoover's vast
experience and personal
capacity, have cemented
the structure and activi-
ties of his agency. It is not
a generalized police
agency. It is an agency of
investigation.
Hoover has never, so far
as I know, registered as
a member of a party.
Nor, as has been re-
ported, does the FBI act
"independently" of the
Department of Justice. It
is there for the depart-
ment to use in its business
of law enforcement. It also
serves measurably and
with the knowledge and
consent of the President
and attorney general cer-
tain critical needs of other
departments and com-
mittees of Congress.
In two wars it has
served the interests of in-
ternal security. It is
known and respected
abroad. And in the cold
war, and without in any
way invading the pro-
vince of diplomacy, the
FBI has served a vital
purpose.
Not the least of Hoov-
er's contributions to the
nation has been his in-
fluence on the moral
education and protection
of American youth.
