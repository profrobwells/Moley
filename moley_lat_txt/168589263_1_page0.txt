Where Is This 'Mainstream'? It
Changes Course With New Events
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Among the many vague
words which have been
introduced into current
jargon is "mainstream." It
is quite commonly applied
to politics, especially to
the state of the Republi-
can Party.
The recentness of the
use of the word is shown
by the fact that with one
exception the dictionaries
I have consulted do not
list "mainstream" at all.
The very latest edition of
Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary defines it as "a
prevailing current or
direction of activity or in-
fluence."
Those who have been
using the word in oppos-
ing Sen. Barry Goldwater
fail to tell us when and
how or where their par-
ticular philosophy pre-
vailed.

The Republican Party
over the 100 years of its
existence has held many
different positions. In fact,
only an utterly naive in-
dividual or a partisan
careless about the truth
can find consistency in
"current or direction" in
either political party over
past years. Since the word
is lifted from natural
phenomena, its political
application resembles the
meandering course of a
river which flows over a
flat country. With every
spring flood the course
changes.
As the Civil War drew
to its end, the magnani-
mity of Lincoln toward
the seceded states prom-
ised to prevail. After
Lincoln's death, radical
Republicanism, under
Thaddeus Stevens and
others determined the
imposition of a Carthagi-
nian peace upon the
South.
★
President Hayes by a
magnificent show of cou-
rage, which cost him re-
election, reversed this
policy and pulled the
Union troops out of the
South. After Hayes, the
Republican Party needed
only to wave the "bloody
shirt" to win elections,
and with the great growth
of industrial life the GOP
fell under the control of
what were called the
"vested interests."
Theodore Roosevelt
promoted a revolt against
this control which ended
in the great division of the
party in 1912. After Wil-
son, the 12 years of Re-
publican control returned
to a course sympathetic to
business expansion.
The smashing victories
of Franklin Roosevelt re-
sulted in a complete reor-
ientation of his party. It
abandoned its early phi-
losophy of state and local
responsibility. Federal
centralization was and is
in the ascendency in that
party.
This Democratic change
of direction threw Repub-
licans into confusion. A
number of the hitherto
devoutly observed GOP
principles were taken over
by the Roosevelt and
Truman administrations
and Congresses. Republi-
cans were offered two op-
tions: Either move into
the area abandoned by the
liberal Democrats and
stand for local and state
responsibility, for econ-
omy in government, and a
neutral position on Negro
rights. On the other hand,
stand by the traditions of
earlier years and thus
identify the party with the
Democrats. As is usual in
politics when two diverse
alternatives are offered,
both were accepted.
This is what has caused
the present division in the
Republican Party. Taft,
and after his death,
Goldwater, threw their
immense influence toward
the first of the foregoing
alternatives. President
Eisenhower valiantly at-
tempted to find a middle
course and in so doing
saw a Republican decline
in the states and local
communities.
What is called conser-
vative Republicanism has
grown greatly since 1945,
especially among young
people, and during the
past three years has
threatened to take over
the GOP with Goldwater
as the symbol of this
movement. That is where
we are today on the eve of
the Republican conven-
tion.

It is irrelevant, then, to
talk about a "mainstream"
for the mainstream will
largely be determined by
what the party stands for
in this campaign. Or per-
haps the struggle for the
control of the party will
still persist.
