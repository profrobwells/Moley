Ominous Suggestion About Gold
Reserves Went Almost Unnoticed
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The ominous and con-
tinuing drain on the gold
reserves of the United
States has been obscured
in the past few months by
several diversions.
One has been the
struggle within the Re-
publican Party over, the
Presidential nomination.
In leveling their heavy
guns upon each other,
Republicans have ne-
glected one of the major
issues against President
Johnson in a campaign
year.
The continuous succes-
sion of optimistic speeches
and statements by the
President would have us
believe that we are living
in the best of all fiscal
worlds. The Treasury has
also provided plenty of
information which might
he described as synthetic
food for confidence.
The press, busy with
reporting these diversions,
generally neglected a most
ominous suggestion of
things to come in a report
of the Joint Economic
Committee under date of
March 19, 1964. The report
was entitled, "The United
States Balance of Pay-
ments." It said, in part:
"The 'free' gold reserve
has declined by an aver-
age of nearly $1.4 billion
per year since 1957, partly
because of the growing
domestic money supply
and partly because of gold
loss to foreigners. It is en-
tirely possible that the
'free' gold supply will be
eliminated even if the
United States restores
equilibrium to its balance
of payments."
It should be noted that
one of the reasons for this
loss of "free" gold is that
the increase of the money
supply by deficits de-
mands more gold for the
reserve against the new
currency. Another and the
more noteworthy cause of
the loss is the withdrawal
of gold by foreigners. In
either case, it is a measure
of lax fiscal policies by the
Administration in Wash-
ington.
The report continues:
"It is a sound policy to
take preventive measures
against a possible crisis of
confidence if the Federal
Reserve Board were
forced to take emergency
action."
Finally, the Joint
Economic Committee re-
commends that "the U.S.
gold stock should be freed
immediately of its domes-
tic reserves function and
made available for inter-
national monetary pur-
poses."
gold for shipment abroad.
Rather than be forced off
gold by present policies,
we would abandon a gold
reserve entirely.
A completely fiat cur-
rency would be the result.
It would be "greenback-
ism" with a vengeance.
There would be unlimited
bank credit expansion.
And the net result would
be uncontrollable infla-
tion.
The administration made
a great play of the
fact that in April, the
month after the report
was issued, there was a
small "increase" in our
supply of "free" gold
stock. This, however, was
not a real gain for the
United States, for the ad-
ministration accomplished
this by drawing upon its
reserves of foreign cur-
rency.
We may be correct in
assuming that this dan-
gerous proposal of the
Democratic members of
the Joint Economic
Committee is a reflection
of what the Johnson ad-
ministration may propose
once the election is out of
the way.
