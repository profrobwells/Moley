Mississippi Gives GOP
a Stay of 'Execution'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Two months ago in
Jackson, Miss., I had the
opportunity to meet with
a group of the leading ci-
tizens of the state. There
were present on that oc-
casion utility executives,
bankers and other busi-
ness executives. There
were also present Gov.
Paul D. Johnson, former
Gov. Hugh White and the
mayor of Jackson.
Nearly all of those at-
tending were Democrats.
The discussion did not
dwell upon politics or the
race question but upon the
advantages of Mississippi
as a home for industry and
its desire to attract more
industry from the North.
There is already a re-
markable change in the
state because of new in-
dustry. There is no doubt
at all about its advantages.
One of the major sources
of wealth which has come
in during the last few
years is the cattle-raising
business. Many cattle
people have come to Mis-
sissippi from the Midwest
because its climate is ideal
for year-round cattle rais-
ing.
On the day after that
meeting I was amazed to
learn the leaders of the
Democratic Party in Mis-
sissippi planned to intro-
duce legislation in May
which would, in effect,
throttle the efforts of the
young Republican Party
to develop a real two-
party system in the state.
One provision of the
proposed legislation would
bar anyone from seeking
office unless he had been a
member of the new party
for four years. Since the
growth of a Republican
Party in a state like Mis-
sissippi must depend upon
the party's getting its ma-
jor candidates from
among those who have
been traditional Demo-
crats, this would have
denied such converts their
essential rights.

Another provision of the
legislation would have
made it substantially im-
possible for Republicans to
hold county or state con-
ventions. The legislation
proposed would have re-
quired county conventions
to have representatives
from a majority of the
precincts in the county.
Another requirement
would have been that a
state Republican conven-
tion have representatives
from a majority of the
state's counties.
Since the new and
Moley
growing Republican Party
in Mississippi is largely
centered in the more im-
portant urban districts,
these conditions would be
impossible to meet.
Wirt Yerger Jr., the
young and aggressive Re-
publican state chairman,
fought hard to awaken the
state and neighboring
states to the danger of
such anti-Republican le-
gislation.

At the time I heard of
this proposed legislation I
felt that it was quite in-
congruous for those in
charge of Mississippi
government to be trying
to bring new industry to
the state and at the same
time attempting to lock
the state by law in a one-
party prison.
Since so many of the
industries they were
seeking to_bring in were
controlled by Republicans,
this was a poor way to
make them feel at home if
they chose to move.
The anti-Republican
bills passed the Senate
and were headed for
adoption. But it seems
that recently the governor
and other Democratic
leaders have decided to
change their plans and the
offensive bills were
pigeonholed in the lower
house of the legislature.
