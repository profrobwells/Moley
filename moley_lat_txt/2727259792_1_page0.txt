Bobby's White House Bid Is
the Stuff of Medieval Legend
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Before I wrote this present piece, I
had written another after I had
studied and reflected a bit upon the
New Hampshire returns. It dealt
with the speculation about the
import of those returns upon Robert
Kennedy's character, methods and
ambitions. But I hesitated about
sending that piece in for publication.
My earlier conclusion was that
Kennedy, despite his ruthless love
of power, is too smart to run this
year; that to challenge Lyndon
Johnson now would split the Demo-
cratic Party, and that because
Kennedy would be blamed for a
Republican victory in November he
might never again have a chance to
win the nomination.
But he has now made his decision
to seek the nomination.
I am convinced that Eugene
McCarthy may be wrong about
Vietnam but completely honest in
seeking a show of hands about the
Johnson policies. I cannot believe
that there has been any collabora-
tion between Kennedy and
McCarthy. In other words,
Moth and the Flame
Cartoon by Grant
McCarthy has not been a John the
Baptist preparing the way for a
Messiah. He is no Kennedy-owned
stooge.
There is evidence that the Kenne-
dys have never been fond of
McCarthy. In the Democratic con-
vention in 1960 he joined that
devoted little group that fought both
the Kennedys and Mr. Johnson for
Adlai Stevenson. McCarthy made an
impassioned speech for Stevenson.
As I have written before, McCarthy
has one of those Irish temperaments
that creates crusades, however futile
the outlook may be. The old saying
about them is "They go forth to
battle, but they always fall."
Moreover, the McCarthy candida-
cy, as he has said, is not designed to
split the Democratic Party. He has
said that if he loses the nomination
he will release his delegates at the
convention. He has worked not to
test the whole Johnson program, but
to seek a referendum in his party on
the Vietnam issue alone.

The Kennedy ambition is of
quite different stuff. This is a
dynastic struggle, much like the
substance of Shakespeare's histori-
cal plays about the late Middle Ages
-like the stories of Richard II and
Richard III. There the battle was
fought in conspiracies and on the
battlefield. There is no blood in
Kennedy drives for power, but there
is plenty of well-financed conniving
and conspiring.
I have often noted that of all the
Kennedys, Robert is most like the
"founding father," Joseph Patrick. I
knew the elder Kennedy very well
indeed during the 1930s. After the
election of Franklin Roosevelt, his
claims for an appointment were
ignored by the White House for 12
long months. His bitterness toward
Mr. Roosevelt was indescribable,
and, as expressed in words, unprint-
able.
In his first two jobs, beginning in
1934, Joseph Kennedy served with
all the great talents for efficiency
that his business career had proved.
But after that, as ambassador to
Britain, his arrogance and ambition
exceeded his judgment. He decided
that the cause of the Allies was lost
and that the British would be over-
whelmed. Finally, he resigned and
returned to the United States, saying
that he came back to help the United
States "keep out of the war." After
that, his relations with President
Roosevelt were terminated by mu-
tual consent.

In the present instance, Robert's
ambition, his hatred for Mr. Johnson
and his contempt for McCarthy have
shattered his judgment. Kennedy is
no real student of history, but he
must know what happened 13 years
before he was born. Then, the
ambition of Theodore Roosevelt
split the Republican Party and
elected Woodrow Wilson. In the
defeat of a party which had held
power for 16 years, the loss of the
presidency alone was not all. The
smashing of the GOP went down
into the states and congressional
districts, the counties and towns.
After that kind of defeat there is no
recovery for some years to come.
Thus, if Kennedy-whether or not
he is nominated-loses a fight in
1968, there will be no comeback for
him in 1972. Party workers and job-
holders cannot forget nor forgive
being driven into the wilderness by
the ambition of one man.
Casting the die in 1968, Kennedy
may well determine his own destiny.
