These were René Wormser of the New York bar , Prof . William D . Jacobs of the University of Maryland and James J . Kilpatrick of * The Richmond News Leader * . Their report , which was published May 16 in the *	National Review	* , is an account of their observations and conclusions as well as a history of British-Rhodesian relations .

Those who voted for Goldwater not only because he was the Republican candidate but because they were dedicated to his views are the concern of this article . Their problem in facing a choice is complex . They do not like Lindsay's liberal views and his affiliation with the Liberal Party . Should they vote—as a protest against both the Democrat Abraham Beame and the liberal Lindsay—for William F .	Buckley	Jr . ? Or should they vote for Lindsay because he offers a better chance to improve the government of New York City ?

text6473	batch2_2_page0.txt	1965	Politically , New York State is sui generis among American states , largely because of the vast and variegated population of New York City and its special and peculiar interests . The conservative who lives here is compelled to accept the liberal tinge in its Republican office-holders and in its laws and customs . The Conservative Party cannot cure that , but merely contributes to the success of Democratic candidates , since	Buckley	cannot be elected .

One such threat is the	John Birch Society	and the utterances and activities of its founder , Robert Welch , and some of the leaders in the group . I have watched the growth of this society with the deepest regret and misgivings especially because so many sincere people have become members of it and risk their good names through association with its more radical spokesmen . Those who are devoted to sound conservative principles owe it to themselves and their true objectives to repudiate the John Birch Society and methods as I do here .

text25684	batch2_234_page0.txt	1961	The evidence is now before us through the enterprise of the press and the statements of members of Congress that the	John Birch Society	has so concentrated its attention on Communism and has become so vehement in its pursuit of that one issue that it has adopted methods and has made statements which must bring it into general disrepute . Specifically , Americans do not like the terms " monolithic " or " authoritarian " as applied to any American group or society . They resent loose and inaccurate name calling especially when applied to Presidents and other high officials who are charged by the people with responsibility for their protection . They don't like the idea of " infiltrating " various worthy organizations

text31159	batch3_41_page0.txt	1960	Until recently , no such guide for conservative voters has been available . But now that need has been supplied by the Civic Affairs Associates , Inc . , 2612 P Street , N.W . , Washington 7 , D.C . Its publication is called " The Free Citizens Voting Record . " Since it has involved an expensive job of preparation backed by no such organizations as the AFL-CIO and ADA , its cost is $ 5 for single copies , and $ 1 for 50 or more . Thus it is suitable for political organizations ,	chambers of commerce	, and trade associations rather than for general distribution . The booklet begins with a statement of the policies and principles on the basis of which its rating of members is calculated . These principles are stated under these general titles : The Free Market ; Limited Government ; Economy in Government ; Economic Growth With Stability ; Equality Under the Law With Elimination of Physical Coercion ; National Security . Its definition of these objectives conforms to what Americans not interested in radical change believe .

A citizens ' group has been organized to " preserve America as an economically stable , self-governing republic that may continue to provide its people with a widely distributed well-being and to serve as an example to the world of a continentwide civilization that can survive without resort to organized intolerance , economic class conflict , the liquidation of oppositions , or slavery to an all-powerful state . " The name of this group is "	Americans for Constitutional Action	. " Heading the list of distinguished Americans who constitute its board of trustees is Adm . Ben Moreell . The noted head of the famous Seabees in the war in the Pacific and more recently the president and chairman of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Co . is the sort of man who can make such a group a powerful force in support of enlightened and dynamic conservatism .

The TVA was the “ yardstick ” concept enlarged into a vast paternalism by George Norris , liberal Republican . The guarantee of bank deposits was suggested to the RFC by President Hoover and was put through in March 1933 against opposition by F.D.R . through the efforts of Jesse Jones , John N . Garner , and Senator Vandenberg . The NRA was created by Hugh Johnson out of several plans , the most definitive of which came from the president of the	Chamber of Commerce	of the United States . Those illustrate the essential unity of history of which Maitland wrote . The origins of the early New Deal were in both parties and in no party . The Maitland phrase , “ a seamless web , ” was actually used by F.D.R . to illustrate his belief in the basic unity of all economic interests . He also expressed this concept in a sentence , quoted by Freidel : “ I plead not for a class control but for a true concert of interests . ” That attracted many conservatives , who left in
