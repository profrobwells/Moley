A WARNING ON CREDIT
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Speaking before a joint
meeting of the American
Economic Association and
the American Finance As-
-sociation, Allan Sproul,
president of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York,
offered a greatly needed
warning against an excess
of consumer installment
credit.
In doing this he has
voiced from a post of high
authority a fear that has
possessed some of us less
informed in the economic
problems involved. He has
stated the limitations im-
posed by law upon the pow-
er of the Federal Reserve
System to check the excess-
es to which a thoughtless
public has in the past been
subject, and of which it
seems once more to be the
victim.
I have noted with won-
derment and no little con-
cern the many new direc-
tions into which installment
selling has moved. The pur-
chase of an automobile in
these days is in most cases
a necessity. But when a
dealer, as was recently re-
ported in the press, devel-
oped a plan by which the
purchaser "bought" a new
car every year with a con-
stantly diminishing equity
in his "property," I won-
dered whether either the
dealer or the industry or
the "buyer" really knew
what they were doing.
*
I noted with apprehensive
amusement the story of a
New Yorker who bought via
installments a saxophone
and some lessons thereon
to be enjoyed by his 75-
year-old father. But the idea
of going to a movie and
paying later in installments
really seemed to be the ulti-
mate.
I have been reluctant to
express my doubts hereto-
fore, partly because I fear
that my old-fashioned ideas
about what used to be called
"tick" are outmoded, and I
cannot exchange jargon
with the "new" economists.
I have also some of the
tenderness of the Scotch-
man at a gay party. It
seems that after the pleas-
ant round of refreshments
and conversation had gone
on for some time, a mem-
her of the party exclaimed
that the man sitting next to
him was dead. The man on
the other side of the corpse
said (substitute your own
Scottish dialect): "Ah, weel.
I knew it all the time, but
who am I to break up a gay
party?"
Also, when I have men-
tioned my worry to an econ-
omist, especially one who
is working for an industry
thriving on installment
sales, I have been told that
there are "built-in" protec-
tions and that the Federal
Reserve is the basic factor
in these restraints.
*
But now, a real master
of the law and practice of
the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem has said it, and here it
is from Allan Sproul:
"Thackeray says in 'Van-
ity Fair': 'Everybody must
have observed how well
those live who are com-
fortably and thoroughly in
debt; how they deny them-
selves nothing; how jolly
and easy they are in their
minds.'
"Well, I am not jolly and
easy in my mind. I am dis-
turbed by the present sit-
uation in consumer install-
ment credit, just as I was
concerned, under different
conditions and for different
reasons, about stock mar-
ket credit until the board
of governors was given
power to establish, and to
vary, margin requirements.
I am disturbed not by the
total amount of consumer
credit but by the fact or
the indication that succes-
sive relaxation of terms has
been largely responsible for
keeping the ball in the air.

"This is a process which
cannot go on indefinitely,
and when it ceases there
will come a time when re-
payment of old debt will
catch up with new exten-
sions of credit. The special
stimulus of a rapidly in-
creasing net supply of con-
sumer credit, which has
contributed so much to the
record production and dis-
tribution of consumer dur-
able goods during the past
year, will then be gone, at
least temporarily.
"Will it then become
clear that we drove our
productive capacity to un-
sustainable limits—for the
present—by borrowing con-
sumer demand from the fu-
ture?"
