WAUSAU, Wis.â€”A good
reflection of the consensus
of political opinion in-
volved in keeping or drop-
ping Nixon as Vice-Presi-
dential candidate is offered
in a poll conducted by the
United Press. Twenty-five
Republican State chair-
men were for nominating
Nixon; 11 were for Nixon,
but "it's up to Ike," four
were for whomever the
President wants; two were
for someone else and six
were noncommittal. The
two who were for some-
one else preferred Sen.
Knowland and former Gov.
Dan Thornton of Colorado.

This opinion of hard-bit-
ten political experts may
be puzzling to some citi-
zens who have "heard so
many criticisms of the
Vice-President." It needs
a bit of explaining in very
practical political terms.
It is hardly necessary to
note that there are many
people who do not care for
Nixon. On this trip to the
Midwest, I have found ex-
actly what can be found in
New York and Washington
on that point.
I tried here to get at the
bottom of one man's anti-
Nixon attitude. In re-
sponse, he said that there
was nothing in particular,
but that he heard a lot of
people say that Nixon was
too aggressive. Then he
identified the "people" as
mostly Democrats. Beyond
that, the explanation wan-
dered into still more vague
territory. I suggested that
this sounded like the old
verse: "I do not love thee,
Dr. Fell; the reason why I
cannot tell..."
*
However, the doubt
about Nixon is real and
certainly will lose the
President a good many
votes. No one knows that
better than the very prac-
tical State chairmen men-
tioned. Those chairmen are
not favoring the nomina-
tion of Nixon because they
are influenced by senti-
ment. They want to win,
and if they thought their
chances of winning would
be better with someone
else on the ticket, they
would say so.
They are, I am sure,
weighing two alternatives,
both of which would lose
their ticket a number of
votes. The first is to renom-
inate Nixon and lose the
anti-Nixon vote. The other
would be to unload him and
precipitate a Kilkenny fight
over replacement.
Anyone else would have
his enemies, too. Some
would be too international-
ist for the Midwest; others
would be too isolationist for
the East. Everyone would
be too much of something
or other. An intraparty
fight would result which
would be disastrous.
In short, the calculations
of the State chairmen are
that more votes would be
lost by dropping Nixon
than by keeping him.
The hard nugget of polit-
ical wisdom involved here
is that no one who could
be nominated for Vice-Pres-
ident could do any better
than take votes from Pres-
ident Eisenhower. The
problem is which candidate
would lose him the fewest.
If there were anyone who
would add to the vote of
Eisenhower, the real logic
would be to drop the Pres-
ident and run that more
popular person for Pres-
ident himself.
I learned that truth from
the late Edward J. Flynn,
boss of the Bronx and ma-
jor figure in dropping Wal-
lace in 1944 and nominat-
ing Mr. Truman instead.
He told me later that his
advice to Mr. Roosevelt
was that Wallace would
lose him the election. Then
when Mr. Roosevelt asked
him for a substitute he sug-
gested a rather obscure
Senator named Truman.
The President asked the
extraordinarily shrewd
Flynn for the reason for
such a choice.
*
Flynn, answered: "Tru-
man will do you less harm
on the ticket than anyone
else. No one can help you.
It is a question of the least
of evils, and all candidates
for Vice-President are
necessary evils. They lose
votes for the head of the
ticket."
That is the main reason
why practical politicians
prefer Nixon. There is an-
other reason, to be sure.
Nixon is a vigorous cam-
paigner, and with a Pres-
idential candidate who ex-
pects to make only a mod-
erately active campaign, a
good trouper will be neces-
sary.
