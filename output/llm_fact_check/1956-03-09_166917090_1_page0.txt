There seems to be a fixed
idea in the midst of the
flood of rumors about the
nomination for Vice-Presi-
dent. That idea is that by
authority of tradition the
candidate for President
should choose the candi-
date for Vice-President.
Perhaps better historians
than I will contradict me,
but I am unable to find any
such tradition.
Perhaps the idea has
been given authenticity by
the manner in which Rich-
ard Nixon was chosen in
1952. According to Presi-
dent Eisenhower, he never
knew of such a responsibil-
ity until the moment he
was nominated. Perhaps
some amateur told him so,
or perhaps Dewey, who ac-
tually had something to
say about picking Earl
Warren in 1948. But Dewey
had nothing to do with the
matter in 1944.
In any event, Candidate
Eisenhower wrote down
the names of five or six
young men and said that
any one of them would be
acceptable. Nixon was the
one the politicians chose.
The President told of
this in a press conference
in June of last year. He
added then that unless the
man chosen for the Vice-
Presidential nomina-
tion "were acceptable to the
Presidential nominee, the
Vice-Presidential nominee
should immediately step
aside." This would imply
that the Presidential nomi-
nee should have a sort of
veto power.
It would be quite natural
that there would be such a
veto. But the initiative for
the most part in the past,
at least so far as the past
50 years are concerned,
has come from various and
assorted politicians high in
the party, notably at the
time of the convention.
As I have indicated above,
Dewey on one occasion had
a lot to do with the choice
of his ticket partner. In the
case of the choice of Brick-
er in 1944, it was a spon-
taneous act of the conven-
tion. The delegates that
year nominated Dewey be-
cause they thought he
would have the best chance
to win. They nominated
Bricker because they loved
him.
F.D.R. in 1932 had little
or nothing to do with the
choice of Garner. In 1928;
Hoover was confronted
with a choice between Sen.
Watson of Indiana and
Sen. Curtis of Kansas. He
was probably right in con-
cluding that Curtis would
do him the less harm.
The dropping of Wallace
in 1944 was practically
forced upon an ill and
vacillating President, and
Truman was selected as
the one who would do him
the least harm.
Amid the many rumors
now floating about, only a
few seem to have some
foundation. One is that
Gen. Lucius Clay has been
a prime mover in the ef-
fort to drop Nixon. Anoth-
er that may be partially
true is that some very in-
fluential Republicans
friendly to Nixon have said
that so far as getting the
nomination for President in
1960 is concerned, Nixon
would be well advised to
decline to run again and to
take a Cabinet post.
But the same Republi-
cans who have said that al-
so believe that so far as the
welfare of the Republican
ticket this year is con-
cerned, fewer votes would
be lost by keeping than by
dropping Nixon.
That seems to be the
overwhelming opinion of
Republicans who are ex-
pert in politics. Three polls
show that, by the Associat-
ed Press, the United Press
and the Wall Street Jour-
nal.
The cabal opposing
Nixon is probably respon-
sible for the story, widely
published, that the Presi-
dent suggested to Nixon
that he consider withdraw-
ing and take a Cabinet post.
This has no substantiation.
There also seems to be no
truth in the rumor that the
President has been dis-
turbed by advice that Nix-
on would be too heavy a
load for the ticket. There is
reason to believe that the
President positively told
people in Georgia that he
wanted no more such ad-
vice.
The matter, it seems to
me, has now reached the
point where these rumors
should be stopped. If Nixon
desires to run he ought to
announce it. Then Chair-
man Hall of the Republican
National Committee might
well poll his committee and
make the results publicly
known. Then the President
might well be confronted
with this opinion of the
only really authentic voice
of his party and agree or
disagree. The matter would
then be settled one way or
the other, and if the choice
is to drop Nixon, there
could be other candidacies
built up. If the choice is for
Nixon, the anti-Nixonites
could find some other
avenue for the exercise of
their talents.
