Among the issues, presented by former President Truman in his party's bid for votes is the old, familiar charge that the Eisenhower administration is a "big business" administration.
In this, he has been followed by the three principal candidates for the Democratic nomination.
Rep. Wright Patman (D) Tex., the perennial patron of small business, has provided some figures to prove the case—figures circulated by the Democratic National Committee.
The basic assumption by those who argue against big business is that large units of enterprise are essentially the enemies of small businesses. And the political angle is that since there are more smalls than bigs, there are votes to be gained by such an appeal.
The notion that big business is inimical to small business has been refuted so many times and in so many ways that it seems unreasonable that experienced politicians should feel that any advantage can be gained by their appeals. Nevertheless, they still use the story, and in recent months have offered just enough in the way of statistics to enliven the argument.
Unless, however, the politicians are willing to charge that the Eisenhower administration has falsified the figures of the Department of Commerce—and no such charge has been made—the alleged case against big business influence is completely without foundation.
In 1955 there were 11,000 business failures. In 1939, with one-third fewer businesses in operation there were 15,000. The rate of failures per 10,000 businesses was 42, whereas in the three years, 1939-1941, when all business were feeling the spur of war, the average rate was 63 per 10,000.
A further implication in the attack on big business is that it is growing at the expense of little businesses. The Department of Commerce reports that 210,000 new businesses were established in the first half of 1955. There were 189,000 established in comparable months in 1954. In 1947 there were 3,600,000 small businesses in operation. There were 4,100,000 in 1955.
Critics of the Eisenhower administration have made much of certain figures of defense contracts, perhaps for the purpose of casting a stone at the former head of a big business who is now Secretary of Defense. A Senate Small Business Committee, apparently for purely partisan reasons, has estimated that small business in 1954 received 25% of government contracts and that estimates for 1955 indicated that small businesses would get only 20.8%.
This percentage for 1955, it will be noted, was an estimate. When all the returns were in this estimate was proved to be wrong. The returns for 1955 show that for the five months through November, 1955, small business was getting 28% of all government contracts for the current fiscal year.
The basic fact is that the fortunes of big and little business are interdependent and complementary. Large business needs small business and small business cannot get on without large business. There is no essential conflict of interest.
