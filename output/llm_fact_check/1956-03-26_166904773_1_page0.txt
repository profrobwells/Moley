FEWER AND LARGER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
By now, most Americans
are buried beneath a tor-
rent of incomplete farm
statistics. Out in the Presl-
dential primary campaigns,
Democrats are outbidding
the Eisenhower-Benson
program, and Kefauver is
outbidding Stevenson.
Impossible promises are
bid as a price for votes. The
bidding goes on in Con-
gress. Hundreds of pages,
at a very high cost of print-
ing, are consumed in the
Senate portion of the Con-
gressional Record, with
little relief in sight. Later
the same rigmarole must
be gone through in the
House.
Never have so few farm-
ers been promised so much
by so many politicians, and
never with a greater pro-
portion of misrepresenta-
tion.
Clear light on the whole
program has just come
from the very State that
seems to have suffered the
most from farm politics;
Minnesota.
The Farm Economics
Bureau of the old and
reliable Northwestern Na-
tional Life Insurance Co.
has issued a bulletin pro-
viding a perspective of a
century on the farm prob-
lem. The bulletin comprises
only three pages, but the
research on which it is
based must have been very
extensive. One of the more
important things shown in
this survey is the relatively
small place that agriculture
occupies in the national
economy.
In 1850, two-thirds of our
population lived on farms
and produced one-third of
the nation's total output of
goods and services. Now, a
century later, only one-
seventh of our people live
on farms and they produce
one-seventeenth of the
national output of goods
and services.
In determining this com-
parison the Farm Econom-
ics Bureau developed a
new statistic called "farm
gross national product."
The bulletin explains this
to be the total value of all
production, less the value
of all materials such as
fertilizer and gasoline used
in producing it.
The total farm product
has, of course, gone up. In
1850 it was worth less than
a billion dollars, but in 1954
it was $21,500,000,000. But
meanwhile, the entire
national product went up
from three billion dollars
in 1850 to 360 billion in
1954.
The amazing rise in the
efficiency of farming is
shown by the fact that it
required five acres to feed
each American in 1850,
whereas two acres are
sufficient now.
The decline in the pro-.
portion of farm output to
the total national product
was interrupted for a short
time during the two world
wars, but it resumed its
downward trend in 1920
and 1950 respectively.
Meanwhile, farms have
been getting fewer and
larger. In 1920 half of the
total farm land was in
farms of 260 acres or less.
In 1950 only a third was
in farms of that size. There
were 6,812,000 farms in the
depression year 1935, but
in 1954 these properties,
plus 100,000,000 new acres,
had been merged into only
4,782,000 individual farms.
It should be noted on the
background of this amazing
concentration of farm own-
ership that it was not ac-
companied by any evidence
of distress sales. The aver-
age of forced sales because
of foreclosures, bankrupt-
cies, etc., during this period
of concentration has been
very low, being less than at
any time since 1912. It was
only 2.1 per 1000 in
1954, whereas in 1935 it
was 28.3 per 1000.
This record of forced
sales should be noted by
those Americans who a
month or so ago saw
Edward R. Murrow's dis-
torted, propaganda televi-
sion show on the farm
problem.
In that show there was
featured a "forced sale" as
characteristic of the present
plight of agriculture. It was
pointed out later, however,
that the example that was
used was actually not a
forced sale.
The farmer's lot may not
always be happy, but over
the years it has seen a
remarkable improvement.
