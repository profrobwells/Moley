It was during the late
Franklin D. Roosevelt's
exuberant first term that,
in a moment of casual
optimism, the President
coined the expression "We
planned it that way." It
was in that term that, at
his insistence, the Social
Security Act was passed.
Presumably, that was to be
a prize specimen of plan-
ning, not only for the
present but for the future.
The illusion in that
system was that a wise and
provident present would
lay aside for an unknown
future. The fact is that the
irresponsible present is
throwing the burden on the
future.
Let us consider the facts.
It is obvious in the first
place that people now re-
ceiving old age and survi-
vors benefits have not
"bought" what they are
getting with what they paid
into the system. But if
those benefits were deter-
mined by need (which they
are not), they could be a
reasonable means of help-
ing people who were born
too early to begin their
payments.
But the case is worse
than that.
According to an analysis
made by the Social Security
Administration itself, a
married man who entered
employment covered by Old
Age and Survivors Insur-
ance (OASI) at the age of
60 in 1955 and who earned
$100 a month would have to
pay slightly more than $167
a month (or more than he
earned) for five years to
obtain the same potential
benefits which he and his
employer are now paying
only $4 a month to obtain.
This means that he will get
a windfall of $9800.90,
which is the difference
between what he will pay
in, $240, and what he will
get, $10,040.90.
Now let us consider this
collectively. According to
the Social Security Admin-
istration, the OASI un-
funded accrued liability
was between $244 billion
and $270 billion in Decem-
ber, 1954. That simply
means that at that moment
the amount that the gov-
ernment would owe in
promised benefits, less the
expected contributions, ex-
ceeded the money in the
Social Security "trust"
fund by around a quarter
of a trillion dollars. That,
ladies and gentlemen, is
the discrepancy between
what a "liberal" govern-
ment promised at the time
and the actual facts.
That huge deficiency will
have to be supplied by our
children, born and as yet
unborn. That is what we
are leaving behind for fu-
ture generations to pay.
A gentleman who knows
as an expert, W. Rulon
Williamson, who served the
Social Security Board for
10 years as chief actuarial
consultant, said this before
a committee of this Con-
gress:
"It is impossible to fore-
tell costs either absolutely
or relatively. But the 1955
outlay was more than five
times the amount set down
in 1935 as the expected
1955 burden... the method
of presenting potential
costs is subject to giving an
unwarranted assumption
of definiteness as to the
road ahead."
The government, Mr.
Williamson continued, has
been "minimizing the seri-
ousness of bequeathing
great liabilities instead of
assets."
In less polite terms, this
means that the government
has not only been conduct-
ing phony financial fan-
dangos but lying about it.
Mr. Williamson con-
cludes that "the unfair-
ness to our future citizens
must bring some sort of
reaction, if those citizens
have any grasp of what we
are doing to them."
That is a big "if." It
might suggest that Johnny
ought to learn to read the
fine print in our Social Se-
curity reports.
