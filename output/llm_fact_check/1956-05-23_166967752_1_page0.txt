OUR HIDDEN DEBTS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Many a man has been
financially ruined not by
his directly obligated debts
but by liabilities subject to
chance conditions, carelessly
incurred, which suddenly
became direct obligations.
He perhaps added
his name as cosigner of a
note and because of the
principal's default found
himself, so to speak, holding
the bag. Or improvident
members of his family
created debts which he
had to meet.

Congress is creating that
sort of obligation for the
taxpayer many, many
times in the course of a
sessionâ€”obligations which
may fall upon Americans
as yet unborn or now in
their cradles. These are,
for all practical purposes,
hidden. They are utterly
unknown to the great majority
of citizens. Even
those in official life are unable
to calculate them exactly.

*

I have asked a competent
student of government
business to try to get the
facts concerning the public
debt, and all that has been
found are certain gross figures
which clearly indicate
that the contingent liability
or hidden debt is considerably
more than the direct
debt.

U.S. Treasury experts
and the President's Council
of Economic Advisers don't
know and obviously cannot
know. But it is certain that
the government is very
deeply obligated, and officialdom
is not anxious to
have the public made conscious
of the extent and nature
of these hidden debts.

The best figures I have
been able to get are dated
in 1954, when the public
debt was subject to a statutory
limitation of 274 billion
dollars. The various
obligations and liabilities
beyond that were $291,300,000,000.
Thus the aggregate
was $565,300,000,000,
or if you wish to get the
full impact of what your
representatives in Congress
have loaded upon you, more
than half a trillion dollars.

Then, if you want to
know why another generation
may become well acquainted
with the word
"trillion," add to this figure
250 billion dollars of
the unfunded accrued liability
of Old Age and Survivors
Insurance. Then add
the various indeterminate
authorizations which place
a moral obligation upon
Congress to make future
appropriations. For example,
the vast Missouri Valley
Project if fully carried
through would cost upward
of 20 billion dollars,
and the recently authorized
Upper Colorado Project another
4 or 5 billion.

The conditional obligations
include such items as
U.S. Postal Savings accounts,
Federal Reserve
notes, Federal Deposit Insurance,
Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance, National
Service Life Insurance,
and guarantees of the
Federal Housing Administration,
Public Housing Administration
and Veterans
Administration.

They also include actual
liabilities plus uncompleted
contracts, purchase orders,
etc. There are several
smaller items. The total is
as I have indicated it
above.

*

It would be hardly fair
to jump to the conclusion
that this total is the true
public debt. The Treasury
quite properly points out
that there are some double
countings and other factors
to be deducted from the total.
Federal loans, guarantees,
and insurance operations
are measurably protected
by reserve funds,
mortgages, etc., which
stand between the borrower
and the government's
obligation.

Nevertheless, it is grossly
misleading to say that
all that we owe as a nation
is limited to the public
debt, upward of 275 billion
dollars, which we hear so
much about.

As the Tax Foundation
points out: "Another major
depression could lead to
large losses, which would
have to be met by taxpayers."

Those taxpayers, please
bear in mind, are you and
your progeny and successors.
