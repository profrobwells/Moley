The Supreme Court has
just-given organized labor
reason to rejoice and to go
all out in effort and ex-
pense this election year to
elect prolabor Congressmen
and Senators.
Its decision in a case in-
volving compulsory union-
ism in the railroad indus-
try could lead to tight
union control of untold
numbers of workers in
many industries where
union membership is not
now requisite to holding
jobs.
The Hanson case had to
do with an injunction
which several nonunion
men secured in a Nebraska
State court against the
contract of the nonoperat-
ing railroad unions and the
Union Pacific Railroad
which would compel them
to join a union or lose their
jobs.
The Supreme Court de-
cision reversed the con-
sidered findings of the Ne-
braska Supreme Court. The
high Nebraska court had
ruled the 1951 amendment
to the Railway Labor Act
sanctioning compulsory un-
jonism violated the State's
constitutional "right-to-
work" amendment and the
Bill of Rights-specifically,
the Fifth and First Amend-
ments, which guarantee
life, liberty and property,
and freedom of association.
Under the union-shop
contract Hanson and the
others faced the loss of
their jobs, seniority, retire-
ment benefits, pensions,
etc., unless they joined the
appropriate unions.
The Nebraska court de-
clared that the amendment
to the railway act is un-
constitutional and that the
State right-to-work law is
valid.
Now we have the highest
court in the land, function-
ing, it seems, in as remote
an atmosphere as Justice
Douglas finds in his moun-
tain-scaling pastime, re-
versing this sound decision.
The present court, in
fact, chose to turn its back
on the profound constitu-
tional issues involved. It
merely asserted that an act
of Congress holds preced-
ence over right-to-work
laws now operating in 18
States.
The fact that Hanson
had conscientious objec-
tions to joining a union and
that under the Federal law
he must join or lose his
employment carried no
weight whatever.
In a very real sense, the
court has here abdicated
its trust to interpret law
in the light of the Consti-
tution. It follows that Con-
gress must reconsider and
decide between compul-
sion and freedom.
It is highly ironic that
the Supreme Court deci-
sion will trigger greater po-
litical activity by organized
labor. For in his opinion
Justice Douglas expressed
the view that "periodic
dues, initiation fees and
assessments" gathered
from compulsory member-
ship would be used only
for support of the collec-
tive bargaining agency.
Justice Douglas' knowl-
edge of just what unions
are, how they operate, and
where their funds are
spent must be fragmentary
indeed. A union in this
country is more than a
bargaining agency. It is
also partly a political or-
ganization, a social club, a
fraternal order, and an in-
surance concern. If Hanson
now joins a union it will
mean that some of his
money, in one way or an-
other, will be used for pur-
poses for which he has no
sympathy.
