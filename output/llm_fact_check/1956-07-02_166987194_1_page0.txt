DEMOCRATS, GO
HOME!
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Those Democrats who
believe in a conservative
approach to public prob-
lems should begin to pack.
For it may well be that
before another Presidential
year comes everything but
the name of the Democratic
Party will have gone and
new tenants with new ideas
will occupy the old struc-
ture, For gradually the
Democratic Party has come
to be dominated by its
allies and auxiliaries. They
will hold the purse strings,
and they will call the
tunes.

Three organizations are
foremost in any analysis
of what is happening to the
party that elected Cleve-
land, Wilson, and F. D. R.
These are the Americans
for Democratic Action, the
National Farmers Union,
and the political arms of
the AFL-CIO.
A comparative study of
the legislative programs of
the three organizations re-
veals striking similarity.
One might imagine that the
three programs had been
masterminded by one in-
dividual or had at least
been worked on by the
same economic consultants.
Certainly they are all in-
spired by the same ide-
ology.
The differences which ap-
pear are matters of empha-
sis and approach rather
than of ultimate goal.
In domestic affairs the
three organizations base
their demands for legisla-
tive action on the concept
of government responsibil-
ity for full employment and
an expanding economy.
★
All three are for easy
credit and tax reduction
for the middle and low-
income groups, and the
maintenance of high in-
come taxes on wealthy in-
dividuals and corporations,
All three are for a $1.25
per hour minimum wage
with expansion of cover-
age; more Federally assist-
ed public housing for lower-
income families; Federally
insured credit for middle-
income and farm housing;
Federal aid to education;
Federal programs of road-
building and resource de-
velopment; Social Security
expansion; and the estab-
lishment of a national com-
pulsory health insurance
system.
The three organizations
are also for an agricultural
program of Federal assist-
ance to raise the income of
the family-sized farm and
increase the consumption
of farm produce--such pro-
gram to include price sup-
ports, conservation and
cheap credit, government
stockpiling of foods and
fibers, increase in the
school lunch program, and
the inauguration of a Fed-
eral food-allotment pro-
gram for low-income fam-
ilies.
They are for TVA and a
multipurpose regional riv-
er and valley development
plan modeled after TVA.
And they are for Federal
participation as well as
Federal standards and con-
trols in the development
of atomic energy.

In regard to foreign pol-
icy, although the Farmers
Union is less specific on
most points than the ADA
and the AFL-CIO, the
Farmers Union and ADA
are pushing for an interna-
tionally planned and ad-
ministered world food re-
serve to alleviate hunger,
promote economic devel-
opment in underdeveloped
areas, and stabilize prices
for agricultural products.
All three organizations
are vehemently against
what they all call the "give-
away" of offshore oil rights
to the States; against the
right-to-work laws; against
private "monopoly" of elec-
tric and/or atomic power;
against colonialism; and
against the Bricker amend-
ment.
Since both Walter Reu-
ther, AFL-CIO vice-presi-
dent, and James Patton,
president of the Farmers
Union, are national vice-
chairmen of the ADA, it is
not surprising that the
three programs are so much
alike. The separation of
the three organizations un-
der different banners, as
well as the separation of
their propaganda, lobby-
ing, and political action
functions, merely makes it
possible for them to carry
on on a wider front and at
different levels.
