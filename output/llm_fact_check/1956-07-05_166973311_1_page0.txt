KINDEST
KILLING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
It would be a pity to have
the proposal before Congress for Federal aid for
school construction die in
a filibuster over the Powell
amendment. It deserves
death, but there are better
ways to kill it.
If the determination of
the Rev. Adam Powell to
bar Federal funds from
segregated districts and
States were the only
argument against the idea,
there might be some compromise. Indeed, the Powell
amendment might be
beaten on the basis of
need, or, better still, on
the basis of principle.
★
If, however, the Powell
amendment kills the idea
this year, there will be
spread over the land the
idea that there were legitimate reasons for Federal
aid and that delay would
merely intensify the necessity of Federal action.
The actual fact is that
there are such serious
objections to the plan that,
except for politics, it is
likely that Congress would
long since have rejected
the whole idea.
First, there is the matter
of principle. At the recent
Governors' conference at
Atlantic City, Gov. Lausche
together with Govs. Shivers, McKeldin, Coleman
and Timmerman, prevented an endorsement of the
report of the conference on
education which was submitted to the White House.
The grounds taken were
that Federal aid for school
construction would only be
the opening wedge for Federal aid for teachers' salaries and other matters relating directly to the content of the educational process. This would ultimately
place the control of what
the nation's children would
be taught in the hands of
a Federal bureaucracy
which, in turn, would be
controlled in the future as
in the past, by pressure
groups such as the NEA.

The great vitality of public
education in the United
States has been due to its
variety. Specific schools
have been free to experiment, to try new ideas,
and to individualize instruction. Federal control
would mean standardization, rigidity and stagnation. Ideologically it would
mean the glorification of a
supergovernment centered
at what would be the synthetic seat of culture and
learning.
But what of need? In
1953 there was compiled by
the Bureau of Education,
from reports from the
States, what has attained a
certain dubious fame as the
"status report." It had
the same claim to accuracy
and justice as a school
grade calculated by a student of interest.
But the Bureau of Education and the Secretary of
Health, Education, and
Welfare permitted the President to use their figure of
school need in his message
to Congress. In less than
two months Mrs. Hobby
made the amazing admission that the figure used by
the President was a gross
overestimate. The classroom need, she said, should
have been 176,000, not
300,000 as the President
had been led to say.
★
Since then, devastating
criticisms have been leveled
at more recent estimates
made by the administration. It has been brought
out that a considerable part
of the school building
"needs" are not for real
schoolrooms at all, but for
auditoriums, gymnasiums,
and similar items.
So far as teacher needs
are concerned, the Bureau
of Education has been
grossly off the beam in its
projections. On Sept. 8,
1955, it estimated that
there would be an increase
of only 5100 qualified
teachers from the fall of
1954 to the fall of 1955. On
Nov. 30, 1955 — less than
three months later — it
confessed that the actual
increase of qualified teachers was 86,664.
It would seem to me that
unless the government itself knows something more
about simple arithmetic, it
should be the last agency
in the world to take over
the education of the youth
of the land.
