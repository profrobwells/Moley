Conservative Democrats
are moving for legislation
before the end of the ses-
sion to right the judicial
wrong committed by the
Supreme Court in the so-
called Nelson case. In that
case it was declared that
the Smith Anti-Sedition
Act, a Federal statute,
superseded an anti-sedi-
tion act of the State of
Pennsylvania and by clear
implication that it would
supersede all State legis-
lation on the same subject.

The author of the Smith
Act, Rep. Howard Smith of
Virginia, was himself one
of those who strenuously
disagreed with the Supreme
Court’s decision. He
pointed out that if Con-
gress, in passing his bill,
had intended to nullify
State laws it would have
written that fact in its
own statute. There are 47
such State laws.
Smith has now prepared
and introduced a bill, HR
3, to modify the so-called
pre-emption doctrine so
as to permit concurrent
jurisdiction in order that
the State act, where not in
conflict with the Federal
act, can be also enforced in
the State courts for the
protection of the State and
its citizens. The gist of
HR 3 is that in order to
pre-empt any field of law
Congress must specifically
declare in its concurrent
legislation that it so intends.

In the Senate a similar
bill has been introduced by
Sen. McClellan jointly with
Sens. Byrd, George and
others. Their bill is S 3143.
This issue has been de-
bated since the historic
Gibbons vs. Ogden case in
1824, but its real signif-
icance was never apparent
until Congress began to
legislate on all sorts of
social welfare subjects.
There have been strong
dissents on the court to
the pre-emption doctrine
so arbitrarily applied in
the Nelson case. In a case
declaring that the State of
Alabama had no right under
an Alabama law to
inspect the renovation of
butter, Justice Frankfurter
forcefully dissented. He
said almost exactly what
the bill now proposed by
Smith and others would
enact into law—that is,
that if a Federal law pre-
vented that State from inspecting
butter, it would
have said so. Apparently
what is sauce for butter is
not sauce for treason.

Backing the bills HR 3
and S 3143, there is a long
list of responsible organiza-
tions—the committee on
law reform of the Ameri-
can Bar Association, the
executive committee of
the Association of Attorneys
General, the Farm
Bureau Federation, and
others. Strangely enough,
the Eisenhower Depart-
ment of Justice is opposed.
In this it is in the strange
company of the ADA, the
NAACP, and the AFL-
CIO.
It is even more astonishing
that the Eisenhower
administration’s Depart-
ment of Justice should be
opposed to remedial legisla-
tion when it is clear that
Socialists on principle are
strongly in favor of Federal
pre-emption in all
things. That philosophy
contends that it is much
easier to clamp down the
shackles of a welfare state
if the laws of 48 States can
be ignored.
