The American statesman
who said a generation ago
that the tariff was "a local
issue" has been the butt of
academic merriment ever
since. But what he said was
very true. It is still true.
What he meant was that
the local economic interests
determined the view of the
citizens and the way their
representatives voted.
The vast difference in at-
titudes toward the tariff at
the moment is reflected in
organized labor.
*
In the past the tariff has
divided parties and commu-
nities. A traditional split in
financial backers of the Re-
publican Party existed be-
tween Wall Street and the
industrial Middle West.
The first was interested in
the profits made in foreign
investments and exchange;
the latter in the preserva-
tion of the domestic mar-
ket for its products.
Old friends in Congress
disagreed violently because
of the products of their
communities. For example,
there were John N. Garner
and Sam Rayburn. Ray-
burn was in a real sense a
protege of Garner. But
they disagreed on the tariff
-Garner needing protec-
tion for West Texas cattle,
and Rayburn free trade for
his East Texas cotton.
The moral arguments of
the free trader always
sounded better. Cordell
Hull, from the great cot-
ton-producing South, re-
garded his free-trade ideas
as something that aligned
him with the Lord and the
protectionists' arguments
as undiluted deviltry.
*
The reciprocal tariff plan
was conceived not so much
as a reasonable device to
adjust differences as a won-
derful political expedient.
It enabled the Roosevelt
administration in New Deal
days to sound like free
trade while it really did lit-
tle to lower the tariff. In-
deed, Roosevelt before he
had finished his first cam-
paign for the Presidency
had earnestly asserted the
iniquities of Republican
(Hawley-Smoot) tariff pol-
icies while he solemnly
promised that he would
lower no rates on either
agricultural or industrial
products.
And now come the vari-
ous elements of labor with
differences that may rend
asunder the political soli-
darity which we hear so
much about.
The argument is over
making the United States a
member of the Organiza-
tion for Trade Co-operation
(OTC), which is the inter-
national administrative or-
ganization for the general
agreement on tariffs and
trade. The bill which would
accomplish this is HR
5550.
Testifying for the bill,
Stanley Ruttenberg waxed
eloquent. Could it be that
the influence of the United
Auto Workers, dominant in
the CIO and dependent up-
on industry which needs no
protection (as yet), in-
spired the Ruttenberg en-
comium?
But 18 AFL unions, two
CIO unions, four indepen-
dent unions, and four rail-
road unions, have gone on
record as opposed to the
bill.
Those unions are opposed
not only because of the fear
of foreign competition but
because they see the dan-
ger in turning our tariff
making over to an interna-
tional body safely out of
reach of political action at
home.
*
Edwin L. Wheatley,
president of the Brother-
hood of Operative Potters,
puts this fear in strong
terms:
"The State Department
has been and still is the ha-
ven of world economic
planners, those who know
exactly what industries are
good for this country,
which ones should be weed-
ed out by the bureaucrats
and which ones favored...
The State Department
should be deprived of its
power of life and death
over our industry. This
bill would make that power
and influence permanent
...The United States
would have one vote out of
the whole lot, or one out of
35."
The means proposed for
tariff reduction differ from
those of the 1890s since
they are a part of the great
U.N. network of commis-
sions and agencies. But the
reality of protection re-
mains. Like the statesmen
of the past, the unions
which stand to lose will op-
pose those which will sup-
port tariff reductions. The
words are different but the
tune is the same.
