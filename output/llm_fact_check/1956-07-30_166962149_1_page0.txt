American citizens who
believe that the education
of their children is a local
responsibility and that it
should not be controlled
and directed by a distant
bureaucracy in Washing-
ton will breathe easier now
that Federal aid for school
construction seems to be
dead for this year at least.
But the battle for local con-
trol is not over.
The proposal in another
form is bound to reappear
with all of the phony sta-
tistics with which it was
urged this time and per-
haps a few more.
In the same batch of
news which told of the de-
feat of the bill in the House
there appeared information
that the National Educa-
tion Association was
streamlining its already
powerful lobby in Wash-
ington. That means more
and more pressure for Fed-
eral control.
The Federal bureaucracy
has already gotten itself
far into the business of ed-
ucation.
Although West Point
was established in 1805
and the Morrill Act provid-
ing Federal aid in the form
of land grants was passed
in 1862, the Federal gov-
ernment for the greater
part of its first century and
a half pretty much left ed-
ucation to the States and
local communities. But
with the great burgeoning
of federalism in the past
two decades, vast adven-
tures in Federal education
have been undertaken.
Those who fondly be-
lieved that education was
essentially a State and lo-
cal function were astound-
ed in 1950 to learn from
Frank Pace Jr., then Di-
rector of the Budget, that:
"The total Federal expen-
ditures for education,
broadly defined, have in-
creased from $500,000,000
in 1939 to $4,500,000,000 in
1949."
In 1955 it was shown by
an investigation conduct-
ed by the Gwinn subcom-
mittee of the House Com-
mittee on Education and
Labor that 31 departments
and agencies of the Federal
government were carrying
on 315 educational pro-
grams at a cost of $2,173,-
000,000. The cut in cost from
1950 to 1955 was due to the
expiration of the time limit
on the GI bill of rights,
which cost nearly 3 billion
dollars in 1950 and $620,-
000,000 in 1955.
But other agencies were
expanding not only in the
amounts spent but in the
diversity of their activities.
Indeed, the Federal Office
of Education boasted in
1954 that Americans were
getting Federally support-
ed education in programs
"associated with the pub-
lic schools, private schools,
universities, vocational ed-
ucation, vocational rehabil-
itation, farming, business,
government, military serv-
ice, office management,
health, currency, thrift, re-
search, civil defense, law
enforcement, handi-
caps, veterans education,
citizenship, penal institu-
tions, surveys, Social Se-
curity, occupied areas,
school lunches, conserva-
tion, national parks, libra-
ries, apprenticeship, and
numerous other facets of
education in the national
life."
Certain pertinent facts
which show that it is im-
possible for the Federal
government to subsidize
education without control-
ling it were brought out by
the Gwinn subcommittee.
Since American youth
must receive military serv-
ice, the information and ed-
ucation program of the
armed services has a cap-
tive group which must sub-
mit to a great deal more
than purely military infor-
mation under the sweet
titles of "orientation" and
"indoctrination."
An excellent example of
indoctrination in the ele-
mentary schools is a pub-
lication of the United
States Office of Education
entitled "How Children
Learn About Human
Rights," which is a strong
propaganda job of playing
up the world Declaration
of Human Rights. Thus the
bureaucrats say that it
does not matter whether
the Senate approves of the
U.N. Declaration of Human
Rights if we can teach it
to the children.
Those who believe that
such stuff will not become
the staple instruction of
the nation's children if
Federal subsidies are given
for schools are indulging
in a delusion. Wherever
Federal money goes, the
bureaucrats are close be-
hind.
