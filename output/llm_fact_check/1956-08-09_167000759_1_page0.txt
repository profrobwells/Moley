OBITUARY OF A CANDIDACY
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
According to published
reports, the final rites of
the Kefauver-for-President
movement were sad in-
deed. Mighty men like
Jiggs Donohue and J. How-
ard McGrath, accustomed
though they were to the
hard blows of political for-
tune, shook with muffled
sobs. For the moment their
ticket on the grand prize is
just a worthless slip of pa-
per. Once more they must
tread the dusty path of po-
litical oblivion.
The emotions of the can-
didate himself were appar-
ently hidden. Perhaps as a
practical politician he en-
joyed the consolation that
the nomination would be
worthless in any event. Per-
haps as the colossal egotist
who alone conceived him-
self to be Presidential tim-
ber in 1952, he plans to try
it again in a more propi-
tious year.
*
Kefauver did only frac-
tionally as well, so far as
delegates went, as he did
four years ago. This time
he had stronger opposition.
This time more people have
learned to dislike him. This
time he had no television
circus to carry him to the
American fireside.
There were those, like
the present writer, who an-
ticipated that, while he
would not get the nomina-
tion, he might spoil the
chances of Stevenson. But
the Kefauver nuisance val-
ue diminished after Min-
nesota. The Stevenson suc-
cess was not so much due
from Illinois as the very
special aversion which pro-
fessional politicians over
the nation have conceived
for the Senator from Ten-
nessee.
Kefauver earned this
hatred of organization men
by the fact that his rise to
the Senate was achieved by
an antiboss campaign as
well as by the peculiar un-
reliability of the man. A
younger Ed Crump would
have snuffed him out in
1938. But advancing age
dulled the judgment of the
COFFMAN
Estes Kefouver
Memphis leader so much
that he put a third candi-
date in the primary and Ke-
fauver emerged a minority
winner. In his second cam-
paign for the Senatorship
he had little opposition.
As far as the Vice-Presi-
dential nomination is con-
cerned, it is likely that the
Donohue-McGrath hopes
are not well founded. To
begin with, it looks very
much as though Stevenson
would not have to make a
deal for the Kefauver dele-
gates to win the nomina-
tion. And nothing but dire
necessity would induce
Stevenson to take as a run-
ning mate a man whom he
so cordially dislikes.
Moreover, the home State
of Kefauver seems solidly
against him for any further
honors. The attractive Gov.
Clement probably has am-
bitions of his own, and
with the opportunity pre-
sented by the keynote ros-
trum he can do very well
for himself. In any event,
Clement will be in firm
command of the delegation
since the Tennessee State
Democratic executive com-
mittee has purged itself of
any semblance of Kefauver-
ism.
â˜…
This opposition from Ke-
fauver's own State would
probably be fatal. But there
will also be powerful op-
position from the higher
powers in the party. For-
mer President Truman has
made no bones about his
opinion of Kefauver, and
Speaker Rayburn feels
much the same way. The
bosses of political labor
will have a lot to say about
the ticket, and they are not
especially favorable to the
Senator from Tennessee.
Nor can there be much Ke-
fauver strength among the
southern leaders because
his record on the issues so
dear to them is, to say the
least, cloudy.
Finally, there are alto-
gether too many attractive
people available for the
Vice-Presidential spot to
warrant taking chances
with a man who has made
as many enemies as Ke-
fauver. There are Gov.
Clement and Sen. Kennedy,
and Sen. Gore, Sen. Sym-
ington, and others.
The end of the Kefauver
aspiration is imminent.
And so far as a moral to
the tale is concerned, it
may teach us all that some-
thing more is required for
a Presidential nomination
than mere ambition.
