THE 'CATHOLIC VOTE'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In David Lawrence's
U.S. News & World Report
of Aug. 10, there is an
article entitled "Can 'Cath-
olic Vote' Swing an Elec-
tion?"
The editorial note pret-
acing the article is not very
clear. It means, I believe,
that some unnamed back-
ers of Sen. John F. Ken-
nedy have made a study
which John M. Bailey, Con-
necticut Democratic chair-
man, has been passing out
to political writers and
others. The magazine
leaves its readers to judge
the interest value of the so-
called study, its relevance
to the availability of Ken-
nedy for the Vice-Presi-
dential nomination on the
Democratic ticket, and the
desirability of thus drag-
ging a religious factor into
a political decision.
*
I believe that intelligent
and sensitive Catholics will
render a negative judg-
ment on all three of the
foregoing counts, especially
the last one.
Few will deny the attrac-
tiveness of Sen. Kennedy.
His bright political future
may be assumed. He would,
without any reference to
his religion, be an attrac-
tive candidate for Vice-
President. But he is poor-
ly served by this study
made in his behalf.
In the first place, the
"study" reveals its rickety
factual and logical basis
by claiming on one hand
that there is a Catholic
vote and then saying
that there "can be" one. It
leaps forward by listing a
number of States which-
assuming that Catholics in
those States would cast
aside all else and vote their
religious preferences-
would go for a ticket which
includes a Catholic. One
might just as easily list a
number of decisive States
which might be carried by
Gov. Herter, who suffers
from arthritis, if all per-
sons afflicted with rheu-
matism voted for him on
that ground. But the
"study" calls these "Cath-
olic States."
*
Then the "study" goes on
to raise the question
whether the Democrats
are losing the Catholic vote
because in 1952 the so-
called Catholic States
showed a shift to Eisen-
hower. This is pure non-
sense, because every other
element in the population
shifted to Eisenhower in
that election.
Finally, a list of Catholic
candidates is presented
with statistics to show that
they ran ahead of the Ste-
venson - Sparkman ticket.
The same sort of list could
be made up of non-Catholic
candidates who ran ahead
of the hapless Stevenson in
1952. Moreover, this as-
sumption that such candi-
dates as Zablocki and Lesin-
ski ran strong because they
were Catholics is absurd,
because there were two
other elements vastly im-
portant in their favor. They
were Poles, and they were
supported by the great
power of the political arms
of labor.
The most important ob-
jection to this sort of prop-
aganda is that it drags
religion into politics with
all of the bitter prejudices
that are thus aroused. I
shall never forget hearing
a great religious leader,
Rabbi Stephen Wise, tell
his congregation: "When-
ever there is a Jewish vote
there will be and should be
an anti-Jewish vote."
This appeal for support of
Sen. Kennedy on the
ground that he will get a
"Catholic vote," is almost
certain to arouse a latent
but potent anti-Catholic
prejudice in every corner
of the land. It is a poor
service to Sen. Kennedy
and to the church of which
he is a member.
