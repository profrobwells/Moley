NIXON'S
ROLE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
A convention of the Republican Party decided by an overwhelming expression of confidence that Richard Nixon is an appropriate running mate for an enormously popular and beloved President and is at the same time a trustworthy potential successor in the dread event of a vacancy in the White House.
This decision was reached after months of debate and uncertainty. But to those who were able to see into the minds of those who were to make the ultimate choice—the leaders and workers of the Republican Party—the decision that finally emerged was inevitable. Ultimately even the President paid his respects to the wishes of his party.

In short, Nixon is a party choice by people who had small respect for those who wanted someone selected primarily for those whom Stassen called "independents," Democrats, minorities, labor and our friends abroad.
Nixon attained that tremendous vote of party confidence not only because he had done so much to help the President to make useful an office which has been so useless in the past and because of his enhanced stature as a man and statesman, but because he is a genuine Republican, a fighter, a capable campaigner, a conservative and a real believer in two-party government.

In fact, we may say—despite the oft-repeated expression that President Eisenhower is not really a Republican but a man above party or of all parties, despite the glorification of people who call themselves independent, and despite the contemptuous attitude of so many toward politicians and the business of politics—the deep sense still prevails that the sure support of liberty and a free government rests with two-party government.
Americans and the British are altogether too familiar with the deadly peril of a many-party system which ultimately degenerates into a one-party system to abandon the old idea of two parties arrayed

against each other as rivals for the privilege of filling the offices of government.
There are two functions that a party fills in a two-party system. The first is what may be called the "watchdog" function. That means that the constant watchfulness of the party out of power and its constant questioning and criticism of those in office is the surest way to get honest and efficient public service. As long as men are mortal and possessed of a measure of original sin, they will bear watching and criticism.

Moreover, since a party too long in office gets lazy, incompetent, and often dishonest, it is very important to have an alternative set of individuals to take over the government.
A second and idealistic definition of a party's function is that of Edmund Burke who said that a party is a means of joining people together whose ideas and ideals are kindred in order that by such a union they may realize those ideas and ideals in law and its administration.
Both of the functions of party government are likely to be realized in the selection of Nixon. For Nixon, as so many Democrats have testified by their attacks, was a formidable watchdog when his party was out of power and a reliable defender when his party had taken over. He is clearly a dynamic conservative in the best sense of that phrase.
No one is better qualified to appreciate the point of view of Midwestern and Western Republicans, such as that of Dirksen and Halleck, and also the outlook of the more internationally-minded Easterners, such as Herter and Dewey. His selection by an unbossed convention is a reaffirmation of an American belief in two-party government.
