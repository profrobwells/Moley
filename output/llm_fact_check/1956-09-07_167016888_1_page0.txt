M'KINLEY TO ROOSEVELT TO EISENHOWER
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In last week's press
conference President Ei-
senhower was asked a
very complicated question
which, reduced to its sim-
ple elements, was intend-
ed to suggest that the
"new" Eisenhower Repub-
licanism was a repudiation
of an earlier Republicanism
and was in effect Roosevelt
"New Dealism."
In his reply the President
said that if he believed in a
policy or principle he was
not interested "in who
brought it up." He then
added that some people
who wanted to describe a
a person who was "well
to the right" were likely to
say, "Why, he was to the
right of McKinley." The
President then said he had
recently read the last
speech McKinley made, the
day before he was shot. In
that speech McKinley came
out for reciprocal trade
treaties and in the course
of his speech added: "Isola-
tion is no longer possible
or desirable."
That is correct, and the
President might have add-
ed that the great advocate
of such reciprocal trade
treaties before McKinley
was a Republican Secre-
tary of State, James G.
Blaine.
Indeed, when in planning
the series of proposals
which were later called the
New Deal, the reciprocal
idea was seized upon by
Franklin D. Roosevelt's ad-
visers as a means of get-
ting him off the tariff hook.
Since he planned to attack
the Hawley-Smoot Tariff
Act enacted under Presi-
dent Hoover, he had to find
a way to avoid specifying
exactly what tariff rates he
proposed to lower. To say
that he was for rates fixed
by negotiation enabled him
to avoid specifications. The
advocacy of that form of
tariff tinkering also enabled
Candidate Roosevelt to
bridge the gap between
such high tariff members
of his party as Sens. Walsh
and Pittman and free
traders like Cordell Hull.
This was not the only
New Deal measure which
had its origins in earlier
years. The comprehensive
planning of river valleys
was advocated by Herbert
Hoover when he was Secre-
try of Commerce in 1926.
This, with plenty of gov-
ernment paternalism, is
what came to be the TVA.
The Roosevelt farm plans
were for the most part a
development of ideas which
originated among midwest-
ern Republicans in the
1920s.

Social Security was fash-
ioned from scattered ex-
periments in several States
and from British experi-
ence.
The guarantee of bank
deposits was embodied in
an amendment to the Glass
Banking Act offered by Re-
publican Sen. Vandenberg.
The Securities Exchange
Act was passed in 1934
largely because the earlier
Securities Act, passed with
Roosevelt's blessing in
1933, had failed to work
and bankers like Averell
Harriman came to Wash-
ington begging for some
sort of relief from the New
Deal of 1933.
The NRA, which was a
New Deal measure but
which was not mentioned
at the Chicago convention,
was largely taken from
ideas presented by Henry
I. Harriman, a Republican
and at the time president
of the Chamber of Com-
merce of the United States.

The PWA was an effort
to satisfy proponents of a
huge spending program ad-
vocated by Alfred E.
Smith, William Randolph
Hearst and Sen. Robert M.
La Follette.
In the development of
government policies, even
when they are called
"new," the equipment of
the bride is suggested:
"Something old and some-
thing new." Also, in this
case plenty borrowed, and
some sprinkling not of blue
but of pink.
Certainly a Republican
President is now just as
much entitled to claim
these measures as is his op-
ponent, who knew nothing
about the New Deal until
he read about it in the
newspapers.
