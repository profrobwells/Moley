RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Lesson of Maine
and the GOP Future
The Democratic victory
in the elections in Maine
has been called a blessing
in disguise for Republicans,
because it will shake them
out of the complacency
which seems to prevail
among them.
That statement is correct
except for the words "in
disguise." There is nothing
hidden about it. It is the
best possible thing that
could happen to the Republican Party everywhere.
It is a solemn warning,
first, that to use the name
"Eisenhower" without an
effective party organization
is to invite disaster; second,
that mere prosperity
is no guarantee of success
to the party in power;
third, that the power of the
political agencies of certain labor unions is a greater threat than the official
Democratic Party, and finally, that the conditions that
brought this Republican
disaster in Maine are present in several other States.
In short, it should teach us
that in politics it is utter
folly to take anything for
granted.
There has appeared in
many places which I visited this summer a fantastic idea among major businessmen that, since Eisenhower is able to run, the
election is secure and that
their interests will be cared
for. This has blinded them
to the fact that a Congress
is also at stake in this election and that a Republican
majority in either house is
not only not assured, but
if there is such a majority
it will certainly be small.
On the other hand, with
the activity of the AFL-CIO Committee on Political
Education as a powerful
factor in this campaign, it
would be quite possible to
have a Democratic majority which might carry
the Eisenhower-Nixon
ticket down to defeat.
This self-delusion has
meant that the regular
party organizations are not
getting the help from volunteers that was given in
1952.
The Maine Republican
organization is not only
distracted by internal
squabbles but has practically disappeared as a
vital operating group. Officers of the Republican National Committee in Washington who visited Maine
within the last three weeks
reported back to headquarters that the Maine situation was pathetically weak
and that the only hope was
to cut down the size of
Gov. Muskie's majority.
We now know that his
majority was greater than
it was in 1954.
American politicians and
Americans generally
should rid themselves of
the delusion that prosperity is an element of
great political importance
in the country. In the first
place, prosperity has a
soporific effect upon the
very people who should be
out supporting the party in
power.
This was shown in 1952
by the dire failure of the
slogan "You Never Had It
So Good." In the second
place, it should be realized
that voters are not mere
Marxian robots responsive only to appeals to
their stomachs and purses.
They are concerned with
many things other than
economic matters.
In Maine it was a well-known fact that the AFL-CIO political agencies were
providing money and manpower especially manpower to do the job of
defeating Republican Congressmen. The charge was
made that this help was
coming from outside the
State. Perhaps it was. But
it should be noted that the
political arms of labor can
activate plenty of political
workers within the State,
and when there is very
weak organizational effort
on the other side, those
workers are decisive.
It must be realized that
a number of other States
have Republican organizational conditions which are
not unlike those in Maine.
In Pennsylvania there is
new blood at the top of the
State organization. But it
will be a miracle if the disintegration of the last few
years can be overcome.
Similar conditions exist
in Michigan and, to a degree, in a number of other
States. The dangers to the
Republicans this year, as I
have pointed out several
times, are not in agricultural unrest but in industrial areas where Republicans have been rendered
apathetic by the very prosperity which they claim as
an asset.
