KEYSTONE
PERIL
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The reaction of Repub-
lican workers in Washing-
ton after the Maine elec-
tion was summarized by
one man who said that "it
is better to be scared in
September than October."
There isn't any doubt about
the "scared" part of this
statement. And the great-
est worry now, as it has
been for many months, is
Pennsylvania.
It came with a big shock
to find that Republicans
have suffered a 600,000 loss
in the registration in Penn-
sylvania. In 1952-the GOP
had 1,000,000 majority in
Pennsylvania registration.
Today that edge has shrunk
to 400,000.

Because this election
may be decided in a few
big States including Penn-
sylvania, my assistant, who
is a competent, realistic re-
porter, spent 10 days in
that State in July and Au-
gust.
Conditions in Pennsyl-
vania are probably better
than they were in July and
August. They certainly are
better than they were when
George Bloom took over as
Republican State chairman
last spring. The compe-
tence of this man as a
political leader was well
stated by one reporter who
said that "if anyone can do
it, George Bloom can."
However, the disinte-
gration of Republicanism
has been going on a long
time in Pennsylvania. For
many reasons, including
bad government, Philadel-
phia ceased some years ago
to be a Republican certain-
ty. Republican decline there
began when Roosevelt be-
gan to carry the city in
Presidential elections.
Registration figures, usual-
ly the final indication of a
political turn, have been
significant over the past
eight years.

In 1948 there were 700,-
000 Republicans on the
books and 290,000 Demo-
crats. Now they are about
even. Meanwhile, the Dem-
ocrats elected their first
Mayor in 67 years. This
man, Joseph S. Clark Jr.,
is now running against
Sen. Duff. A big increase in
the Negro population, the
vigorous activity of the
political arms of organized
labor, the moving about of
the population within the
city and its suburbs, and
the general public dissatis-
faction with the Repub-
lican city leadership have
made Philadelphia a Dem-
ocratic stronghold.
This has meant a vast
shift in patronage, and con-
sequently many Republican
workers have changed
their allegiance.
What has happened in
Philadelphia has also hap-
pened in many other parts
of the State. County gov-
ernments, for many, many
years "safely" Republican,
have had an influx of Dem-
ocratic officials. Every city
over 25,000 is now con-
trolled by Democrats. And
as everyone knows, an at-
tractive Democrat now sits
where a long succession of
Republican Governors used
to control the vast patron-
age of the State.
★
Of all the Congressional
seats in the nation which
according to the figures for
1954 are "marginal," Penn-
sylvania has 10%. It ex-
ceeds all other States in
the number of House seats
which are "on the line."
The loss of the House by
the Republican Party in
1954 was due to a switch
of 20 seats from Republican
to Democratic, while there
were only five which
turned the other way.
Pennsylvania contributed
three of those losses. In one
of those districts the Pres-
ident has his home. There
is some comfort in the be-
lief that it may go back to
the party of its most dis-
tinguished citizen.
All this is well known
to the high command of
the Republican National
Committee, and help in
money and manpower is
being sent in to supplement
the efforts of State Chair-
man Bloom. But the decay
of years may not be re-
paired in the weeks that
remain. In Pennsylvania
the lack is not a shortage
of Republicans. The prob-
lem is a shortage of work-
ers and the lack of a vigor-
ous party organization to
mobilize volunteers.
