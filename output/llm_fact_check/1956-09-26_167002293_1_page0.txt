SEATTLEâ€”It was quite
evident when I visited this
city in July that it would
take a rather rude jolt to
move businessmen to take
a more active part in sup-
porting the Eisenhower-
Nixon ticket and Gov.
Langlie's bid for the Sen-
ate seat now held by War-
ren Magnuson,
Well, they have had that
jolt, and it remains to be
seen whether it will stim-
ulate more vigorous Repub-
lican action or will loosen
the bonds of pessimism.
For the margin by which
Magnuson led Langlie in
the recent primary is no
minor matter: It was, in
round numbers, 398,000 to
261,000.
*
There are a number of
circumstances which
should be considered in
evaluating this setback for
Langlie. In the first place,
the Governor has not really
started his campaign, while
Magnuson has been very
active since the adjourn-
ment of Congress.
Moreover, there was a
nasty primary fight in the
Republican Party for the
gubernatorial nomination.
It is also true that party
lines are quite indistinct in
Washington, and many Re-
publicans who were angry
at Langlie because of the
fight for the Governorship
may have voted for Magnu-
son and will, in the course
of the next six weeks, re-
turn to their party affilia-
tion. It is also true that
the primary vote was only
about 60% of what may be
expected in the election.
*
Moreover, the poor show-
ing of Langlie in the rich
agricultural region in
Southeastern Washington
may be a farmers' protest
which can be countered
later by administration Re-
publicans.
Perhaps, however, the
biggest factor was a quiet
but strong effort by the
political arm of labor
unions to get out their
vote. And unless there is a
strong, organized effort to
counter this forced the la-
bor vote and not the issues
will decide the election.
It is a fact, which any-
one versed in politics will
tell you, that businessmen
in the Seattle-Tacoma area
have always been some-
what friendly with the ami-
able and personable War-
ren Magnuson. The senior
Senator, it is said by even
strongly Republican
businessmen, is quick to
answer their letters and to
lend them aid in small-mat-
ters that concern them. It
seems to make little differ-
ence to some of them that
Magnuson votes almost
exactly along the lines of
the more Socialistic mem-
bers of his party, including
Morse and Murray. Cour-
tesy covers a multitude of
sins.
Moreover, Magnuson is
no demagogue of the Morse
species. He has refrained
from denouncing all men of
business and all possessors
of large, worldly goods as
malefactors.
However, he is meeting
a real champ in Langlie.
The Governor has come up
from a bad primary show-
ing in three elections to
win out, and he has no
doubt about his capacity to
do so this time.
*
Things will be different
at election time with the
immense prestige of Presi-
dent Eisenhower on the
ticket.
My own judgment, after
talking with a good many
people here both in July
and on this occasion, is that
a good deal will depend up-
on whether two factions of
organized labor, the Team-
sters and the CIO, can get
together before election
and put all of their man-
power and money into the
drive for Democratic can-
didates.
To a degree that force
could be countered success-
fully by an awakened busi-
ness community, but at the
moment there is not much
evidence of that. In Oregon,
on the other hand; busi-
nessmen have been so in-
censed at the vicious at-
tacks they have suffered at
the hands of Morse and
Neuberger that they are
mobilizing not only money
but plenty of manpower.
The tide has definitely
turned there, but not yet
in the State of Washington.
