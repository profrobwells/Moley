RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Maine Debacle
and Sherman Adams
It is strange, considering
the fact that Sherman
Adams comes from New
Hampshire and that he is
now pretending to master-
mind the entire Republi-
can campaign, that he
seems to have done so little
to forestall the Maine de-
bacle.
In the first place, this is
no Adams in the great tra-
dition of generations of
economic security. This
Adams had to earn his com-
petence in the lumber busi-
ness. He was once presi-
dent of the Northeastern
Lumber Manufacturers As-
sociation. So he must have
known something about
the desperate situation pre-
vailing in Southwestern
Maine because of the de-
pression in the textile busi-
ness.
Moreover, as a New Eng-
land businessman he might
have done something to
alert the Maine business
community that, with the
CIO putting forth every
effort to get out a big vote
to defeat Republican Con-
gressmen in the two dis-
tricts which lie close to
New Hampshire, it would
be necessary for business-
men to get their junior
executives out into the
precincts to help the weak
and dispirited Republican
organization. But appar-
ently the right hand of the
President was too busy
telling Chairman Hall how
to carry the corn belt.
This is not the first of
Adams' fumbles. It was the
President's "right hand"
who pushed Interior Secre-
tary McKay so suddenly
into the Oregon race for
the Senate that there was
no time to clear the way of
opposition. Hence, another
candidate was incensed
and remained in the pri-
mary contest. This meant
an initial handicap for Mc-
Kay in a contest in which
every circumstance must
be favorable to win.
In Maine, as I indicated
in a previous article, the
great strength of the two
Democratic candidates in
the 1st and 2nd Districts
was due to the intensive
drive by the CIO to get out
their vote. This effort was
made easier by the fact
that the textile towns in
Southwestern Maine are
deeply depressed and have
been for some time.
With the mills shut down
because of the competition
of Japanese and British
goods, the unemployed
workers were quite recep-
tive to the argument that
the government had been
indifferent to any effort to
provide relief.
There could have been an
answer to that, two an-
swers, in fact: First, that it
was a Democratic Congress
that failed to provide re-
lief; second, that GATT, the
international tariff-tamper-
ing outfit—General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade
—was a product of Tru-
man years. But since there
was little concerted activ-
ity at the precinct level by
Republicans, those answers
were not driven home.
This tariff argument will
be murderous in other New
England textile centers.
For as Allyn McIntire, vice-
president of the Pepperell
Manufacturing Co., pointed
out last week in a speech
before the National Indus-
trial Conference Board,
"the entire textile industry
has serious doubts as to
how much of the market it
can retain—to say nothing
of wondering whether we
can participate in its fu-
ture expansion."
McIntire pointed out
further that the advantage
hitherto enjoyed by the
American textile industry
in a productive superiority
because of better machin-
ery is rapidly disappearing
because Japan is quickly
modernizing with Ameri-
can-type machinery. There
is also the wage differen-
tial: Japan's prevailing
wage rate is one-tenth of
ours. Also, Japan can buy
raw cotton from the United
States at a rate 25% under
that charged our own tex-
tile industry.
The long-range prospect
is "melancholy," McIntire
concludes. It might be add-
ed that with the power of
the CIO to convince work-
ers that this is due to Re-
publican neglect, Republi-
can prospects in Massachu-
setts are melancholy indeed.
And the irony of it all is
that GATT and the low-
tariff policies of our State
Department were creations
of Democratic administra-
tions.
