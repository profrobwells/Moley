RAYMOND MOLEY:
Voting Records Belie
the Tales of Hoffman
In Paul Hoffman's re-
cent article in Collier's, the
latest in many of this man's
indiscretions, he cites Sens.
Malone, Jenner, Welker
and McCarthy. as "unap-
peasables." For them he
apparently sees no hope.
Sens. Schoeppel, Dworshak
and Goldwater are "men of
faint hope" who neverthe-
less can be saved by the
mediating influence of Sen.
Knowland.
It is interesting to note
that these Senators in-
curred the rancor of Hoff-
man by voting against his
confirmation as a member
of the U.S. delegation to the
United Nations. The article
is therefore discredited on
its face because it repre-
sents personal spite.
Apparently, Hoffman be-
lieves his intimacy with the
President to be so close
that an affront to him is an
affront to the President. In
other words: "Love me,
love my delegate to the
U.N."
Hoffman's article, how-
ever, is not an accurate
representation of the posi-
tion and voting record of
these Senators. The attack
is wholly unsupported by
factual authority except,
perhaps, in the case of Sen.
McCarthy.
All sorts of tricks can be
performed with voting rec-
ords to make a member of
Congress about anything
that is desired. But the
most accurate formula for
the measurement of a mem-
ber's loyalty to the Presi-
dent was placed in the Con-
gressional Records of Aug.
17 and 20 by the respective
chairmen of the Republi-
can Campaign Committees
of the two houses.
Under that formula,
which was described at
some length in some arti-
cles I wrote in Newsweek
in July and September, is-
sues are excluded in which
the President was sup-
ported by both parties, with
no record opposition, or by
majorities of both parties.
The real measure of sup-
port comes in those roll
calls in which a majority
of Republicans favored and
a majority of Democrats op-
posed the President. Here
the lines were truly drawn.
Here the President's lead-
ership was really called
into question. Here the
chips were down.

On these, the Senators
named by Hoffman were in
opposition to the President
only in the percentages in-
dicated as follows: McCar-
thy, 22.3; Malone, 19.7;
Dworshak, 18.6; Welker,
15.9; Goldwater, 11.7; Jen-
ner, 11.2; Schoeppel, 10.1.
The deviation of all Re-
publican Senators in all of
this class of roll calls in
both Congresses was 17%.
Thus Welker, Goldwater,
Jenner and Schoeppel
ranked well above many
Senators of whom Hoffman
would probably approve
very heartily.
Hoffman's reckless attack
upon these loyal members
of the President's party
was not only a serious in-
jury to the Eisenhower-
Nixon ticket but a vicious
and undeserved reflection
on Republican Senators
whom the President must,
if elected, continue to de-
pend on in the years ahead.
