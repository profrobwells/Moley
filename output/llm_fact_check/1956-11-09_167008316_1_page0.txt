HISTORY'S
LESSON
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

At a moment like this,
when immediate issues are
clouded in conflicting re-
ports from Europe and the
Middle East, it may be
the part of wisdom to con-
sider some of the lessons
of history.
Last week, after a
speech in one of the most
cosmopolitan districts of
New York City, I was
asked by a young man of
Hungarian descent what I
thought about the future of
the Soviet power and of
the satellite nations. My
answer was that the pres-
ent events confirm an old
historical rule: that em-
pires crumble at their
peripheries, and that na-
tionalism will always tri-
umph over ideology. My
further suggestion was
that the young man read
and ponder the early chap-
ters of Gibbon's "Decline
and Fall of the Roman
Empire."

The first chapter of that
immortal work may pro-
vide readers with a blessed
relief after months of
hearing and reading what
speech writers have pre-
pared for the Presidential
candidates.
Gibbon was writing of
that golden moment in the
2nd century of the Chris-
tian era, when the empire
of Rome "comprehended
the fairest part of the earth."
The author reminds us that
the principal conquests of
the Romans were achieved
under the republic, and the
emperors, for the most part,
were satisfied with preserv-
ing the dominions thus ac-
quired. Indeed, from the
death of Augustus onward,
the boundaries were never
permanently enlarged.
Some conquests were added
which were soon aban-
doned. Augustus himself,
in his last testament, which
was read in the senate,
advised his successors to
confine the imperial boun-
daries to "those limits
which nature not man had
decreed as bulwarks."
"It was reserved for
Augustus to relinquish the
ambitious design of subdu-
ing the whole earth, and to
introduce a spirit of moder-
ation into the public coun-
cils. Inclined to peace by
his temper and situation, it
was easy for him to dis-
cover that Rome, in her
present exalted situation,
had much less to hope than
to fear from the chance of
arms; and that in the pros-
ecution of remote wars,
the undertaking became
every day more difficult,
the event more doubtful,
and the possession more
precarious, and less benefi-
cial . . .

"Happily for the repose
of mankind, the moderate
system recommended by
the wisdom of Augustus
was adopted by his im-
mediate successors. En-
gaged in the pursuit of
pleasure, or in the exercise
of tyranny, the first Caesars
seldom showed themselves
to the armies, or to the
provinces; nor were they
disposed to suffer, that
those triumphs which their
indolence neglected should
be usurped by the conduct
and valor of their lieuten-
ants. . . . It became the
duty, as well as the inter-
est, of every Roman gen-
eral, to guard the frontiers
entrusted to his care, with-
out aspiring to conquests
which might have proved
no less fatal to himself
than to the vanquished
barbarians."
Under this policy, which
was beneficent while at the
same time it ministered to
arts and pleasures and se-
curity of peace, the Ro-
man Empire managed to
live through a slow decline
for a long time.
This is a policy which,
it seems, has been lost on
the past and present rulers
of the Kremlin. Instead of
using what surplus there
might be to maintain a ris-
ing standard of living at
home, they have madly
spent vast sums on main-
taining a police rule in sat-
ellites whose populations
have grown to hate them
more and more.

In an insane belief that
some solvent for the
world's needs might be
found in universal Marx-
ism as interpreted by Len-
in and Stalin, they have
nourished the delusion that
ideology can supplant na-
tionality and self-govern-
ment. The result is bound
to be the shattering of this
monstrous power in a frac-
tion of the time which the
decline and death of Rome
required.
