RAYMOND MOLEY:
How Prophets Called
the Election Results
Those who responded to
the public demand for pre-
dictions before this election
will probably alibi their
failures by pointing out
that in the last days an in-
ternational crisis caused a
great surge toward the
President. This may have
had some effect, but it fails
to account for predictions
in a number of States in
which the result was im-
plicit in conditions exist-
ing some weeks before the
elections. Moreover, the
prophets never seem to
comprehend that if a tide
is running a certain direc-
tion it gains momentum in
the final three or four days.
In other words, there
was a drift toward Eisen-
hower long before the in-
ternational crisis devel-
oped, and anyone who
could see that movement
of opinion might well have
taken account of it when
most predictions were
made.
In the final days of the
campaign, I made a small
collection of the prophecies
and, without meaning to
view these in a spirit of of-
fensive criticism, it will
serve a useful public pur-
pose to review them.
Most of the prophets
used the device of classify-
ing the States as "sure,"
"leaning" and "doubtful."
This method leaves the
prophet in a good position
to mount the throne of
prophecy once more, no
matter how the results
turn out. But while I can
see why a wise observer
will classify some States as
doubtful, I cannot agree
with the classification of
"leaning." To say a State
is "leaning" is like saying
a person is "threatened"
with tuberculosis. The fact
is that a person either has
tuberculosis or he has not.
There is no such thing as
a "threat" unless this is
meant to mean that a per-
son has a frail constitution
and might be a favorable
target for the bacillus.
When a prophet says
that a State is "leaning" he
means that he, the prophet,
is leaning toward giving
that State to one of the two
candidates. And so in the
following review I am
classing both "sure" and
"leaning" together.
The U.S. News & World
Report prophecy was 317
"safe" or "leaning" for
Eisenhower and 149 for
Stevenson. It classed as
"doubtful" Florida, Penn-
sylvania, Virginia and Min-
nesota.
The New York Times,
basing its estimates on
many "teams" of report-
ers, had 384 "safe" and
"leaning" for Eisenhower
and 147 for Stevenson.
Walter Trohan in the Chi-
cago Tribune avoided "lean-
ing" and gave Eisenhower
374 and Stevenson 84, with
73 "doubtful."
A famous Washington
service which prohibits any
republication gave Eisen-
hower 353 and Stevenson
178.
The Newsweek poll of
50 Washington correspond-
ents averaged 347 for Ei-
senhower and 183 for Ste-
venson.
I made no predictions in
print, but on Oct. 29 I
matched my estimate pri-
vately with a friend who
deserves to be named. He
is Court Eliason, a busi-
nessman in Burbank. Elia-
son estimated Eisenhower
at 432 with 39 States and
Stevenson at 92 with nine
States. He was wrong only
on Louisiana and West
Virginia. If there is any-
thing called political sense,
Eliason has it. I am not
ashamed to have lost a con-
test with so accurate a
judge of public opinion.
