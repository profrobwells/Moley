POLITICAL PICTURE OF 'POVERTY'
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In the campaign which
ended last month voters
were pounded with the ar-
gument about poverty
amid plenty. Certain can-
didates in that campaign
could not deny the broad
picture of national pros-
perity but spoke continu-
ously of "pockets" of un-
employment and destitu-
tion. Indeed, they were
peering so intently into
the pockets that they
failed to see the coat.
This was demonstrated
by an article in the AFL-
CIO Labor's Economic Re-
view, entitled "Unsolved
Problem: America's Low-
Income Families."
Bolstered by figures se-
lected from reports of the
Bureau of the Census, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics,
the Department of Com-
merce and the Congres-
sional Joint Committee on
the Economic Report, the
article reaches this conclu-
sion: "If we add together
the total number of Ameri-
cans in multiperson fam-
ilies with incomes of less
than $2000 (less than
$38.50 a week) and in sin-
gle-person families with
incomes under $1000 (less
than $10.25 a week), we
find a total of more than
31,000,000 Americans were
in this submarginal in-
come group in 1954. In
round numbers they ac-
count for about one-fifth
of the entire nation."
The article fails to quote
or mention the vital quali-
fication made by the Cen-
sus Bureau that "in most
cases the schedule entries
for income are based on the
memory or knowledge of
one person, usually the
wife of the family head."
The bureau adds that this
leads to underestimates, to
misrepresentation and to a
misunderstanding of just
what income means. The
bureau, an institution with
little humor, fails to add
that the wife-informant
herself may have been de-
ceived by the husband for
reasons known to us all.
In its treatment of the
report of the Joint Commit-
tee on the Economic Re-
port the article is very se-
lective indeed. It quotes
from the report that "of
every 10 families in the
United States, one family
still receives a real money
income of less than $1000,
and slightly more than two
families have a real income
of less than $2000. There
has been little change in
the number of lower-in-
come families; there were
9,400,000, families with in-
comes under $2000 in 1954,
compared to 9,600,000 fami-
lies in 1948."
Population growth over
a period of six years is not
considered, nor does the
Labor's Economic Review
mention the qualification
made by the joint commit-
tee report:
"These figures, of course,
do not indicate how many
of these low-income fami-
lies are living at substand-
ard levels. Many possess
other economic resources
-savings and investments,
subsistence farms or other
nonmoney income, owned
homes, etc., and hence
maintain an adequate level
of living despite a limited
cash income."
This AFL-CIO article
merely offers a new varia-
tion on an old misrepre-
sentation. Twenty years
ago President Roosevelt of-
fered his followers the slo-
gan, "One-third of our peo-
ple are ill-fed, ill-housed
and ill-clothed." This he ap-
parently took completely
out of the air or from the
vague assertions of Henry
Wallace.
His slogan was even at
that moment denied by fig-
ures published by the Fed-
eral Reserve Board. Those
figures showed that a very
considerable proportion of
the people with incomes of
$2000 or less owned con-
siderable property includ-
ing homes and liquid as-
sets. A great number were
retired and living at least
in part on self-made means
of security. There were also
a great many who simply
were not interested in earn-
ing more and who pre-
ferred ease to affluence.
Roosevelt's "one-third of
the nation" slogan, which
by its preposterous inac-
curacy drove many a sin-
cere citizen into his opposi-
tion, was merely a varia-
tion of the ancient appeal
which sets class against
class. This recent pro-
nouncement of the AFL-
CIO's Economic Review
merely changes the "one-
third" to "one-fifth" with-
out presenting the essential
qualifications.
