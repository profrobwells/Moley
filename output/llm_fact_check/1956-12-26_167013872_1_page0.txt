There is grim irony in
the fact that Hungarian
workers, who, according to
Communist ideology, are
the source of Soviet power
in a Communist state, are
learning the hard truth of
these words:
"Our present govern-
ment is such that the pro-
letariat, organized to the
last man, must protect it-
self against it. And we
must use the workers'
organizations for the pro-
tection of the workers
against their government."
These are not the words
of an embattled Hungarian
rebel. They are the words
uttered long ago by the
most esteemed Soviet lead-
er and philosopher, Rus-
sian Communism's "little
father" or "teacher," Le-
nin.
Lenin's fears of 30 years
ago have long since ma-
terialized in the U.S.S.R.
Absolute and ruthless one-
party control has charac-
terized the Soviet political
system for many years.
This was achieved by the
same methods we see ap-
plied in Hungary today-
mass liquidation of certain
"classes" and a policy of
punishment and deporta-
tion of recalcitrants and
"deviationists." This was
enforced and backed up by
a police and military force
of terrifying proportions
purchased at a dear price
by depriving the popula-
tion of anything approach-
ing a decent standard of
living. This in turn was
excused by endless accusa-
tions of foreign threats and
intrigues.
In Russia the imposition
of tyranny severely affect-
ed the peasants. Stalin
once observed that the hor-
rors of World War II
couldn't approach the ter-
ror of the "collectivization"
program.
The population of the
satellites, however, is a far
cry from those who
emerged after centuries
under the czars. They pos-
sess national allegiances
the Russian peasant of the
1920s never had. Hungary
has a background of revo-
lution and struggle for na-
tional independence and of
long association with the
West and with western con-
cepts and ideas. And the
rank and file in Hungary,
Poland and East Germany
are unquestionably far
ahead of their Russian
counterpart of the 1920s-
industrially, culturally and
politically.
All this makes the pros-
pect of peace and tranquil-
lity for the satellites under
Soviet domination an un-
substantial fantasy.
Thus far the Soviet
Union has handled the re-
volts in traditional manner.
In recent weeks some 30,-
000 have died in Budapest's
streets and rubble. Many
thousands more have been
arrested and deported. The
Russian Ivan Serov, who
put down similar trouble in
Poland by spiriting away
or eliminating close to
2,000,000 Poles, is on the
job again in Hungary.
But if a Soviet puppet
state is to be a reality, the
wiping out of opposition,
the methodical elimination
of those capable of pro-
viding Hungary with any-
thing approaching a popu-
lar government, has scarce-
ly begun.
Recent refugees met little
or no opposition to their
departure. Their leaving
may have been regarded by
the Soviet Union and the
puppet Kadar government
as one way to get rid of
some nonsympathizers.
And there are a few crumbs
of consolation in this tragic
business in the fact that
probably the moral force
of the United Nations has
arrested to some extent the
grievous undertakings of
the Hungarian police and
the Red army.
Then, too, so-called "neu-
trals" have had a good re-
fresher in Communist
methods. If present trans-
gressions in Hungary did
not erase certain illusions
and ambitions, they un-
doubtedly did check the
degree of those neutrals'
gullibility. Even Nehru
has been compelled to take
a fresh look at Commu-
nism.
Again the capitals of the
free world have reason to
be alert. What will come
of the meeting of the Cen-
tral Committee of the Com-
munist Party in Moscow is
a conjectural matter. It
will not deliver the Soviets
from their dilemma, but,
before acting, those present
might ponder Lenin's
words.
