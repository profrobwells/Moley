TRUMAN'S
LINE
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Former President Truman's
speech at the dinner celebrat-
ing his birthday and boosting
his library was most signifi-
cant and at the same time
most ambitious.
For in the advice he gave
his successor he was at once
sounding the 1954 keynote
for the Democrats and expressing
the position that
may be taken by his party on
the most important issue of
these times,
★
That issue is a choice between
two specific and opposing
concepts of our constitutional
government. On the
one hand is a representative
republic with Congress exercising
on behalf of the voters
power over the purse and the
legislative departments.
On the other hand is a
"democratically elective Executive
with plenary and exclusive
control over his enormous
bureaucracy, with the
actual power of war or peace
as Commander in Chief, with
control over the party machinery,
and with every conceivable
means of publicizing his
wishes. This is called 'executive
leadership.'"
★
Under such a "strong" Executive,
Congress acts as
more or less a mere agent
for confirming the President's
wishes. Under T. R. for a
while, then under Wilson during
his first term and up to
the end of the first world war,
and under F. D. R. for most
of his tenure "executive leadership"
prevailed. Under Truman
continuous warfare between
Executive and Congressional
authority prevailed.
Eisenhower entered office
with co-ordinate powers as
his guiding concept. One member
of Congress expressed the
situation which prevailed in
1953 as "the first time in 20
years when Congress and the
President were on friendly
and equal terms."
It is the consuming passion
of left-wing Democrats, of
their supporters in the press
and in education, and among
the dominant forces in the
great Federal military and
civil bureaucracy to break up
this spirit of co-operation and
to have the President "crack
down" on Congress. Their advice,
of which this discourse
of Truman is an example, is
not to help Eisenhower but to
destroy him and to relegate
the party which elected him
to its former status. But the
danger is that many of Eisenhower's
advisers are more
likely to take Democratic advice
than that of the Republican
leaders of Congress.
If anyone should doubt
that the basic struggle beneath
such matters as the
McCarthy-Army row is this
issue between the Executive
and Congress, he needs
only to read the commentaries
of current internationalist
left-wing writers. It is
all there.
★
There is no question about
Truman's belief in what he
said in the speech but there
can be little doubt that the
speech was written by someone
else. No one who is familiar
with the Truman
style could believe that this
is an authentic specimen
thereof.
I was reminded while reading
it of an incident that occupied
a few weeks ago.
While at a dinner in a restaurant
an old acquaintance
of the early Roosevelt days
came by. His comment was
that we are witnessing the
"dictatorship of Congress." I
tucked this remark away in
my mind as further confirmation
of what will be Democratic
left-wing strategy.
★
It happens that the man I
mention is prominent in collecting
funds for the Truman
library, just as he was
in collecting for the Roosevelt
library at Hyde Park. He
was also an early speech
writer for Roosevelt and no
doubt had a hand in the
preparation of the Truman
birthday address.
But it is well to repeat
that while the hand that composed
the speech was probably
not that of Truman, the
sentiment is wholly Trumanesque.
And Eisenhower
might be well advised that,
despite what some of the
people around him may say,
the purpose of those who are
promoting the idea of "cracking
down" on Congress is not
to help but to destroy his
party.
