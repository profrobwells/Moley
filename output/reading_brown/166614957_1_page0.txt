PATHOLOGY
OF PARTIES
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

All aphorisms, however
hallowed by age or sanctified
by authorship, must, in the
inexorable way of change, he
questioned. In the present
instance, since the expression
to which I refer is from the
New Testament and was
paraphrased by Lincoln at a
great moment in history and
has a very special sanctity, I
should protect myself by saying
that the application to
the present state of the Republican
Party is misapplied.
The expression, as paraphrased
by Lincoln, is that "A
house divided against itself
cannot stand."
In its present application it
is used to refer to the division
in the Republican Party
between the internationalist,
moderately liberal wing
largely concentrated in New
York and New England and
the nationalist, conservative
Middle-Westerners. Between,
if you will, the Deweys and
Lodges and the Dirksens and
Brickers.

The expression of what
some people think is impending
has been heard over and
over during the recent
McCarthy-Army hearings in
such forms as "party suicide,"
or some other doleful
expression meaning dissolution.
A major article in *Life*
magazine is given to that
theme, with all sorts of contemptuous
phrases, applied
by chance or otherwise, to
Republicans who do not go all
the way with the President.
They are the "Old Guard,"
"Whigs," etc. Other writers
are even more abusive. The
people with whom they do
not agree are "antediluvian,"
"mossbacks," etc. It must be
said in fairness that there
are plenty of equally abusive
names applied to the eastern
wing.
Does this conflict necessarily
mean that the party is
dying? More specifically does
it mean that the party will
lose control of the Congress
in the coming elections?

A more seasoned answer
than that of people who are
sounding the alarm is that
the troubles which we are
witnessing do not justify an
affirmative answer to either
of those questions.
I have heard about the
death of this or that party
ever since I could read the
newspapers. In 1940 the Democratic
Party was divided
and defeated. Requiems were
duly uttered, but it was in
power eight years later. Even
T. R. announced in 1912 that
his party had arrived at a
shameful end. He was back in
the fold four years later. And
after the Harding landslide
the Democrats were said to
be merely awaiting burial,
and not a decent one at that.
I am not saying that a political
party is immortal.
Parties have died. But what
is more likely in the case of
parties which have sharp
divisions is that they ultimately
change their character or,
what is even more
likely, they retain their differences
but vote together on
election day. That has been
true of the present Democratic
Party. The divisions
within its ranks grow sharper
with the years. But its unity
in elections and at the time
the houses of Congress are organized
has a way of asserting
itself.

A Congressional election
such as the one which is coming
this year will not necessarily
be a test of the Eisenhower
program or of the loyalty
of the respective Republican
candidates to that program.
It will be decided on
several hundred battlefields
with local and personal issues
predominating.
Those interested in the
anatomy and pathology of political
parties should note
that the basic rule of existence
requires a public official
to keep his job.
There may be violent
intraparty differences, but
when the chips are down for
a Republican, any Republican
is better than a Democrat.
The rule prevails also
with Democrats in office.
I doubt, therefore, that any
Republican Congressman or
Senator wants to elect more
Democrats this fall. Each
candidate, however, will be
running on his own and on
issues of his own choosing.
But he will try to win. And
that urge may well sustain
his party's control.
