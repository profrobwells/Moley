Harry S. Truman by sheer
holdness and political savvy
is clearly making himself the
authentic leader of his party.
The pleasant homilies of
Adlai Stevenson pale into in-
significance by comparison
with the trumpeting of Tru-
man. It may be that the
egghead brethren still chuck-
le and murmur their admira-
tion at Stevenson's sophis-
ticated utterances. But the
boys who win elections feel
the hot breath of reality
when their former benefactor
speaks.
It hardly needs to be said
that Truman's three speech-
es on his recent eastern trip
were intended to lay down
the lines of his party's fall
campaign. Those lines are
easy for organization Demo-
crats to follow because they
were drawn by a master
politician.
Moreover, that same party
maestro aimed with infinite-
ly subtle craft at the weakest
spot in the Republican ar-
mor—the yearning of Presi-
dent Eisenhower to be Presi-
dent of all parties rather than
of the one which nominated
and at least helped to elect
him.
It is the deliberate purpose
of smart Democrats to con-
vince the President not only
that he must depend upon
Democrats of all sorts to
further his ends and recon-
struct his own party, but
that those Democrats are anx-
ious to help him.
Sophisticated Republicans
—and their number is few—
know that the Democrats
are not in business to help
Eisenhower but to drive him
and his party from office.
In line with his carefully
laid plans Truman first de-
livered his long essay in New
York on the Presidency and
its powers. His theme was
that Congress is seeking dic-
tatorial powers and that the
President must fight that in-
vasion of his constitutional
prerogatives before it is too
late. This was a plea that
Eisenhower should emulate
Truman's course while Presi-
dent and declare a more or
less cold war upon the legis-
lative department.
The second speech, before
the Press Club in Washing-
ton, was a plea for biparti-
sanship. This was designed
to destroy the concept that
there is any essential differ-
ence between the foreign pol-
icy created by him and his
predecessor and that now fol-
lowed by Eisenhower and
Dulles.
At that speech Dean Ache-
son was a beaming and atten-
tive listener. And among
those gentlemen of the press
who heard him were several
who are sprinkling their com-
mentaries with pleas for bi-
partisanship.
Somehow, those who harp
on this theme fail to point
out the essential difference
between the bipartisan-
ship practices in Roosevelt-Tru-
man days and the condition
that prevails now.
Then the President and
Secretary of State, well en-
trenched in office and sur-
rounded by a solidly built
Foreign Service bureaucracy
of their own choosing, took
into occasional conferences a
very few Republicans, almost
all of whom, excepting Van-
denberg and Dulles, were in
reality willing stooges of the
regime in power.
Now the President and Sec-
retary of State are striving
to conduct foreign policy
with the aid of a holdover
bureaucracy almost identical
with that recruited in Roose-
velt-Truman days.
The third speech, which
was before the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers in Atlantic
City, was the same good old
cry for inflation. Benefits for
everybody! Three billions
more to spend! Lower taxes
for the lower income groups!
There is the design for this
autumn's campaign. And Re-
publicans are too busy fight-
ing each other to offer an
answer.
