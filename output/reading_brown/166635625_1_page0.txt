STASSEN'S
GIVING
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In a television appearance
Harold Stassen, foreign aid
chief, stated a policy with
respect to loans and gifts
to foreign governments
which, if followed, might not
only be disastrous to our
financial stability but end in
no real lasting self-depend-
ence abroad.
He was asked why our
government had given rather
than loaned some millions to
India for the rehabilitation
of its railroads. He answered
in effect that a loan would
be difficult for India to re-
pay and that therefore it
might result in bad feeling
between these two great "de-
mocracies." Perhaps he takes
the advice of Polonius too lit-
erally about how it is bad to
be either a borrower or a
lender "for loan oft loses
both itself and friend."
★
Perhaps Mr. Stassen was
also solicitous about under-
mining the economical habits
of the Indian government,
for, as Polonius continued,
"borrowing dulls the edge of
husbandry."
I cannot for the moment
recall anything that Shakes-
peare said about the advan-
tages of giving over lend-
ing. But if we are to believe
the records of the village of
Stratford-on-Avon, the man
Shakespeare took a dim view
of people who refused to pay
their debts. His own financial
affairs were numerous, and
when a person failed to re-
pay his loans he forthwith
haled him into court.
Perhaps Stassen was also
thinking about a quaint Ori-
ental custom of returning
presents in kind.
While the Stassen policy
might be a bad thing for pri-
vate lending agencies, it is
possible to see some gains if
applied to the many lending
agencies of the bureaucracy
in Washington. Consider all
the bookkeeping it would
eliminate, all the filing
cabinets, and all the book-
keepers.

But Stassen added some-
thing to his remark which
cannot go without challenge.
He said that the debts owed
by foreign governments to
the United States as a result
of World War I and its
aftermath constituted a cause
of the great depression.
I well remember the labors
of Roosevelt's advisers in the
1932 campaign in assessing
the causes of the depression,
mainly, it should be added,
to provide means of smiting
Hoover. They never came up
with the debts as a cause.
For Roosevelt was as firm as
Coolidge in opposition to the
sentimental appeals of some
Americans to cancel all the
debts.
Hoover also found no such
explanation of the depression.
In his recent memoirs he fails
to list the debts as in any
way contributing to the
crash, although he always be-
lieved that it originated
abroad.
Those debts could not have
embarrassed most of the
debtor countries, for they sim-
ply refused to pay. In 1933
the Greek Minister came to
the State Department and
claimed his government was
unable to pay $12,000 in-
terest. I heard this plea and
was tempted to suggest that
a few stones from the Par-
thenon might be sold for that
amount. But the United
States, as was the policy at
all times, merely extended the
loan and the interest.
The depression has taken
the responsibility for many
things. But it can hardly be
seriously used as an excuse
for substituting giving for
lending.
