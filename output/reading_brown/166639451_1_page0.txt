GIFTS ALONG THE UPPER COLORADO
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
Some weeks ago I com-
mented in this column on the
Upper Colorado storage, pow-
er and irrigation project rec-
ommended by the administra-
tion and destined, if passed,
to cost the nation's taxpayers
billions of dollars. Since then
plenty has been happening
which has had little attention
because of the nation's ab-
sorption in Cohn, Schine, Ad-
ams and others.

After a hard fight in the
House Interior and Insular
Affairs Committee, the bill
was approved by the narrow
vote of 13-12. Most of the
votes for the project were Re-
publican. Most of the 12 op-
ponents were Democrats. The
vote of the Republicans for
this great spending proposal
may in part be due to the
fact that the great proportion
of them come from western
reclamation States.
It may be due in part to
the fact that the Republican
administration favors it. It
may be added that the Re-
publican administration fa-
vors it because a lot of Re-
publicans in the House and
Senate are from reclamation
States.
This vote should remind us
of several things that may be
well to remember this year.
First, that Republicans,
when their sectional interests
are involved, are no more for
economy than was Truman at
his most reckless period.
Second, that if the taxpay-
ers of the big taxpaying
States can be alerted to the
cost of these vast projects
spending may be considera-
bly reduced.
Third, that a Democratic
victory this fall may not be
such a blow to economical
government and business
generally as is anticipated by
some Republican spokesmen.
Fourth, that it might be
well to have on such commit-
tees more representatives of
the States which must pay
for such projects. It seems
to have been assumed in se-
lecting the membership of
committees in both houses
that the only people fit to
pass upon spending are the
people who receive rather
than pay.

Finally, it should be noted
in all fairness that this vast
project may be saddled on
the taxpayers of the country
by a Republican administra-
tion and a Republican Con-
gress elected on a platform
in which candidates were sol-
emnly pledged to economy.
The economic aspects of the
project as spelled out in the
committee's minority report
are staggering. In the first
place, the subsidy to irriga-
tion is enormous. It involves
a gift from the taxpayers of
this and the next generation
of "over $2500 an acre or
$370,000 for each of the 2700
farms to be benefited." I may
add that I have seen and ex-
amined the data from which
these amazing figures were
calculated and I know they
are correct.

The minority also shows
from the terms of the bill
that the bill puts the gov-
ernment further into the busi-
ness of electric power, be-
cause for many years the
dams to be built would not
be needed for water storage.
They would be solely for the
generation of power, remote
in most cases from a suitable
market.
The bill, according to the
minority report, would grant
authority to the Secretary of
the Interior to build trans-
mission lines "all over the
country so long as they con-
nected with a Federal project
now or hereafter to be built."
The authorization of this
bill would very seriously un-
dercut the Hoover Commis-
sion, a fact which will be
made very clear by the dis-
tinguished chairman of that
commission in due time.
It is not only the McCar-
thy fracas that is threatening
the unity of the Republican
Party. It is such a surrender
as this to the advocates of
the policy of spend and elect.
