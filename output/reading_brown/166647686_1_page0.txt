OLD DREAM
REALIZED
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Now that the St. Lawrence
Seaway is approved and be-
yond controversy, the ports
on the Great Lakes are fac-
ing the many problems that
lie before them.
I found during a visit to
some of the cities along the
lakes great optimism tem-
pered by a serious acceptance
of the many tasks that still
lie ahead.
It is the realization of a
great dream—a very old
dream renewed from time to
time and interrupted by many
a harsh awakening. It was
regarded as a glittering pos-
sibility as long ago as the
beginning of this century.
But wars, depressions and
the clash of many interests
checked definitive action by
Congress.

It is probable that the bal-
ance in its favor was tipped
by several circumstances.
First, there was the opening
of new sources of iron ore,
that lifeblood of the North
Middle West. As the Mesabi
and other fields in the Su-
perior region began to fade,
the interests of Cleveland and
other lake cities turned to-
ward Labrador. Indifferent
support turned to almost des-
perate advocacy of a seaway.
There were also the tre-
mendous requirements of the
cold war and a new apprecia-
tion of what a hot war might
mean to our economy. As the
peril to our industrial centers
was becoming more obvious,
Canada was growing to ma-
jor proportions as an indus-
trial and commercial nation.
Canada practically drew the
issue. Either we would par-
ticipate or she would go it
alone. Eisenhower proposed,
and for once Congress dis-
posed.

There can be little doubt
of the benefits to a city
such as Cleveland. Its varie-
gated industries already sell
a goodly percentage of their
products abroad. Every in-
dustrialist with such a mar-
ket anticipates substantial in-
creases. Buffalo, Toledo and
Chicago will also benefit in
that way. Detroit's interests
abroad hardly need to be
mentioned.
The shipping from Labra-
dor alone in vessels designed
for lake commerce and ocean-
going ships made over will be
very considerable. Competi-
tion for this rich commerce
will be keen among the lake
ports.
Plans are already under
way in such smaller ports as
Ashtabula for new docks and
other accommodations for com-
merce. Cities are creating
study committees to draw up
plans and to promote large
harbor improvements.

Some of the more restrained
of the promoters of the sea-
way in these cities are offer-
ing important and, if heeded,
wholesome suggestions. One
is that trade is a two-way af-
fair.
There is plenty of prospect
that a much greater volume
of American goods will be
going abroad than before. But
what are we going to take in
our markets—of foreign goods
in the returning ships? How
far from the lake ports will
the influence of this new
commerce extend?
The answer is that it will
not be so far as some of the
optimists claim. Moreover,
there is a great part of the
world abroad that will still
trade through the same old
ports on the Gulf, on the At-
lantic, and on the Pacific.
The shock to those ports will
not be great. It may not be
appreciable.

How will the essential char-
acter of these ports in the
inland empire be fundamen-
tally changed? For, as the
Army engineers say, only
25% of the commerce travel-
ing the new seaway will be
foreign.
There will also be prob-
lems of getting new subsidies
from Congress for harbor im-
provements, perhaps for deep-
ening and widening the new
seaway.
But all in all, the new sea-
way is going to be a very
substantial benefit to all the
lower lake ports. And for
that, the people there are
duly grateful.
It may be an anticlimax to
add that politically this will
greatly help Republican pros-
pects in the Midwest this fall.
For Republican candidates
and the President himself
can say that, after all those
bitter years of frustrated
hopes, it was a Republican
President and Congress that
turned the trick.
