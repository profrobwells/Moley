GRANBY, Colo.â€”In a pre-
vious column I described the
controversy here in Colorado
over the so-called Fryingpan-
Arkansas Transmountain Di-
version Project, which is now
before Congress for authori-
zation.
The most important spokes-
man for the opposition from
the western slope is John B.
Barnard, an attorney prac-
ticing here in Granby. His
argument is based first upon
the great potential oil and
mineral developments on the
Colorado and the future
needs of that for water.
He also points out that
present and proposed diver-
sions of water to the eastern
slope would not only cripple
such an industrial develop-
ment but seriously impair, if
not destroy, the rights of pres-
ent irrigators to their share
in the water of the Colorado
basin.
A clear perspective of his
figures can only be secured
by a review of the manner in
which the water of the Colo-
rado has been allocated.
More than 20 years ago the
Colorado River compact di-
vided the water between the
lower basin States and the
upper basin States. That com-
pact provided that the upper
basin States would deliver
7,500,000 acre-feet annually
to the lower basin and to Mex-
ico. Then, in 1948, a pact
among the upper basin States
allocated the remainder
among themselves. In that
pact Colorado was allowed
3,100,000 acre-feet.
Of that supply, 1,188,000
acre-feet is already in use
in Western Colorado by users,
including irrigators and oth-
ers with firm legal rights. Of
the remainder, diversions now
operating are taking 377,000
acre-feet. These are the Big
Thompson, the Denver, and
the Colorado Springs diver-
sions, plus a few minor ones.
There are also, according to
Barnard, 528,000 acre-feet al-
ready committed to one pur-
pose or another. That leaves
only approximately 1,000,000
acre-feet.
The Fryingpan project
would take 84,000 acre-feet of
that remainder. After that,
there are proposed several
others which have powerful
support in Congress and in
the Interior Department.
The largest of these is the
Gunnison project, which
would take 600,000 acre-feet.
Denver wants 177,000 from
the Blue River diversion, and
there is a Blue River-South
Platte project with another
270,000. The total of proposed
and already-promised water
would be something like
1,500,000 acre-feet. So it is
clear that there simply is not
enough water to go around.
Barnard is especially doubt-
ful of the Denver demand,
which would, if allowed, give
that city and metropolitan
district two and a half times
its present needs.
The Fryingpan project
is opposed, therefore, as the
opening wedge of a drive
which would prostrate the
agriculture and frustrate the
possibility of industry for the
future in Western Colorado.
There is also the matter of
subsidies for agricultural
land on the eastern slope.
Barnard estimates that under
the Fryingpan project the tax-
payers and power users
would be giving the irrigators
subsidies of $1730 an acre.
From other sources I have
learned that land in that
region raising the sort of
crops contemplated would be
worth somewhere between
$150 and $200 an acre.
Since the taxpayers are
now paying subsidies on food
surpluses, it would hardly
seem to their interest to sub-
sidize in that fashion the de-
velopment of new land with
new food that we cannot use.
John B. Barnard has, it
seems to me, struck a blow
not only for his people on
the western slope but for ev-
ery taxpayer in the nation.
It remains to be seen wheth-
er Congress will agree.
