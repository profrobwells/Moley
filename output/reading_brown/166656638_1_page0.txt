THE DEFEAT OF FRYINGPAN
House Votes Against
Vast Pork Barrel Bill
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
These should be the days
that try taxpayers' souls.
But what with the heat, the
Russians, the Chinese, and
other more lurid subjects,
the taxpayer learns little of
what is put over in the final
days of a session of Congress.
And it is assured that
what is put over is more
spending.
A miracle, assisted by
some alert and conscientious
members of the House of
Representatives, defeated an
authorization last week of
the Fryingpan Arkansas
Transmountain Diversion
Project which would have
cost the taxpayers of the nation
hundreds of millions of
dollars and the people on the
western slope of Colorado a
lot of water that they will
need in future years.
*
I have described that
strange brain child of Interior
Department bureaucrats
in earlier articles in this
space, one of which was written
three years ago on the
scene in Colorado.
I shall merely say here
that it involved a highly dubious
plan to take water
from the west slope through
a tunnel to the Arkansas
River. The water would activate
some power plants to
be built, supply some cities,
and supplement a considerable
amount of irrigation
down the river to the border
of Kansas.
Figures used in the debate,
which I have personally
checked, indicate that the
subsidy on each acre of irrigated
land would be more
than $1300 an acre.
*
The vote in the House was
195 to 188 against the authorization.
An analysis of the
roll call reveals some interesting
things about why
some Congressmen vote for
or against such projects. It
is obvious that Congressmen
from States that are on the
receiving line for reclamation
appropriations would give a
hand to their Eastern Colorado
brethren. But in three
States east of the Mississippi
the votes show several sorts
of motivation.
The Pennsylvania delegation
voted 23-2 against the
Fryingpan. That vote must in
part be attributed to Rep.
Saylor, who has been the most
active and forceful opponent
of such spending projects in
the House. It can also be attributed
to the past education
of several members from that
State in Appropriations Subcommittee
dealing with such
projects.
The Virginia delegation
split six against to three in
favor. The three who favored
the project were Republicans.
The opponents were Democrats.
This is most certainly
because notice was served
through Majority Leader Halleck
that this project was
favored by the administration.
In fact, one of the first
decisions of Interior Secretary
McKay was to endorse it.
*
New Yorkers in about equal
proportions of Democrats and
Republicans voted in the majority
against the measure.
The Ohio result is surprising,
not to say amazing.
Here is a State paying an
immense sum in income
taxes. It would bear a heavy
proportion of the cost of the
Fryingpan. But the Ohio delegation
voted 14-5 in favor of
the project. Four of the five
were Democratsâ€”Feighan,
Hays, Kirwan, and Polk. Only
one, Scherer of Cincinnati,
was a Republican.
Even such stalwart opponents
of spending when Truman
was President as Bender
and Brown voted for the project.
*
No doubt, in the present instance
they were of the opinion
that they were supporting
the administration. But the
taxpayer who feels just as keenly
a dollar spent by a
Republican as by a Democratic
administration will, I am
sure, applaud Scherer for his
irreconcilability.
Taxpayers will also take
note of the strong speeches in
opposition by Smith of Virginia,
Donovan of New York,
and Saylor of Pennsylvania.
Neither partisanship nor log-
rolling nor personal considerations
restrained these men
from laboring to attain a balanced
budget now and in the
future.
I trust that those who read
this will know that I have
not forgotten the element of
log-rolling. To do so would be
an unpardonable lack of understanding
of what has gone
on throughout this session.
