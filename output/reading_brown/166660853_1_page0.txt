THE VOTING
RECORD
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
In a recent article I pointed
out that the familiar verse
from St. Mark about how a
house divided against itself
cannot stand could not have
literal application to the pres-
ent differences within the Re-
publican Party.
I failed to mention that in
the Holy Writ it referred to
hell. It certainly has only a
faint application to American
politics. I did, however, make
the point that party regular-
ity, especially in the organi-
zation of Congress, brings the
parties together despite all
internal differences.
So far as present indica-
tions show, both parties are
about equally divided within
themselves and are likely to
remain so.
The proof of this was re-
vealed in a striking way in
last week's United States
News. That magazine showed
the party roll calls on a con-
siderable number of impor-
tant issues on which Eisen-
hower has expressed himself
for or against.
In the Senate on the tide-
lands bill, the Eisenhower
side won with 35 Republicans
and 21 Democrats. On the
Bricker amendment, Eisen-
hower's opposition was sup-
ported by 17 Republicans and
32 Democrats. This was
enough to defeat the amend-
ment.
The St. Lawrence Seaway
carried with exactly 25 on
each side of the aisle. Public
housing in a modified form
carried with 38 Republicans
and 28 Democrats. Funds for
mutual security carried with
31 Republicans and 37 Demo-
crats.
On the proposed Taft-Hart-
ley amendments, the division
reflected two kinds of Demo-
crats who came together to
defeat the bill. Radical Dem-
ocrats opposed it because it
was not sufficiently prolabor.
Conservative Democrats
wanted to leave well enough
alone. The President's side
was supported only by Re-
publicans, and there were not
enough to win.
The votes in the House
showed somewhat the same
thing.
★
The moral of this is cer-
tainly not that Eisenhower
is a bipartisan President. It
simply shows that on matters
of important principle there
are divisions in both parties
between what may be called
the radical and the conserva-
tive viewpoint.
It also shows that the old
bipartisan conservative bloc
that grew up in the Roosevelt
days is still alive. And it
shows that a solid majority
in both houses is conserva-
tive.
If the President wants to
carry a program through Con-
gress, he will be well advised
to make it pretty conserva-
tive. On that sort of measure
he can count on a consider-
able majority of Republicans
and slightly more than a ma-
jority of Democrats.
It is when he listens to his
left-wing advisers that he
fails to carry his measures
through. It is in the conserva-
tive course that he can de-
pend on bipartisan support.
★
But, even then he cannot
assume that he is a bipartisan
President. If he makes any
such assumption and hopes
to win support by offering
bait to left-wing Democrats,
he will, if he runs in 1956,
have a rude awakening. For
to go left will lose stalwart
Republicans and gain only
the momentary support of
leftist Democrats. For they
will be out there behind
Stevenson or his like, fight-
ing to destroy any Republi-
can.
This reasoning, I am sure,
is not shared by the left-
wing Republicans who seem
to have Eisenhower's ear.
But, if he will examine the
votes, he can see the fallacy
of their advice.
