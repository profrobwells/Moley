Almost unnoticed under
cover of the storm over the
atomic energy bill, the Sen-
ate Committee on Interior
and Insular Affairs approved
a huge pork barrel known as
the Upper Colorado Storage
Project.
It is notable that those
Senators who were at the
moment screaming about Ei-
senhower's "handout" to pri-
vate utilities made no men-
tion of another sort of gratu-
ity to favored sections or
States which is possible un-
der the rules and organiza-
tion and custom which they
themselves have created.
As this proposal 'came
from the Interior Depart-
ment with the President's
blessing, there were to be
two large power dams and
storage reservoirs, at Glen
Canyon and Echo Park, with
12 so-called participating
projects for minor power,
storage and irrigation. These
were carefully scattered
among four States-Colorado,
Utah, Wyoming and New
Mexico. The construction cost
was estimated at something
less than $1,000,000,000.
However, since the propos-
al was introduced it has been
almost impossible to deter-
mine at any given time the
number of the secondary
projects in the hill. New ones
have been added and sub-
tracted with the rapidity of
magic. At one stage it was
reported in a newspaper in
Utah that Sen. Anderson
wanted another project in
New Mexico and, presto, the
project was added.
The Senate subcommittee,
In fact, became so lavish in
tossing projects into the pot
that the construction cost
was raised to $1,500,000,000.
The full committee showed
somewhat more restraint,
but, at that, it has included
projects never approved hy
the administration-projects
on which the Interior Depart-
ment did not, at least in the
original proposal, offer Con-
gress genuinely informative
data.
The burden of such an
enormous project will, of
course, be sustained by
States whose interest or bene-
fit is remote. The four States
directly benefited would pay
in Federal taxes less than
one-fiftieth of the cost.
The total of their taxes will
be only a little larger than
that of Connecticut. The
seven States paying more
than half the cost will be,
in this order, New York,
California, Pennsylvania, Illi-
nois, Ohio, Michigan, and
Texas. New York would pay,
if the construction cost is
kept to $1,000,000,000, $123,-
400,000. California would con-
tribute $93,200,000; Pennsyl-
vania, $69,400,000; Illinois,
$69,000,000; Ohio, $59,000,000;
Michigan, $49,100,000; Texas,
$48,600,000.
Only two of these States,
California and Texas, have
representatives on the Senate
committee that approved
these expenditures, and Sen.
Kuchel of California cast the
only vote in opposition.
New York, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan
would pay more than a third
of the $1,000,000,000 and have
no representative on the com-
mittee.
In fact, there is not a single
Republican Senator on that
lavish and expensive commit-
tee from east of the Mississip-
pi. And the only Democrats
are from Florida and Ken-
tucky.
In all this welter of heed-
less spending, it is hard to find
anyone who is looking after
the overburdened taxpayer
or, in fact, the general in-
terests of the United States.
This is politics, special in-
terest, bad Senate organiza-
tion, and sectional selfishness
at its worst.
The last hope for stopping
this vast and reckless meas-
ure is in the House. There, at
least, the taxpayers have a
few friends.
