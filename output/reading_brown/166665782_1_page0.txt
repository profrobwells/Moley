HOOVER
AT 80
BY RAYMOND MOLEY
The message offered to his
countrymen by Herbert Hoo-
ver at the celebration of his
80th birthday in West
Branch, Ia., in the words of
the old wedding admonition
was "something old, and
something new."
But the allusion cannot be
strained beyond that point,
for there was certainly noth-
ing "borrowed." Hoover is
no man to use a speech writ-
ten by even the most capable
of ghosts. About all that he
borrows is the basic word of
the Bible or Constitution.
It is most significant that
Hoover underlines the dan-
gers that attend the encroach-
ment of the President upon
Congress, the courts, and the
States. This is clearly a tact-
ful reply to the address some
weeks ago by another ex-
President, in which there was
a rasping rebuke to the Con-
gress for usurping the pow-
ers of the Executive.
Hoover says of this dan-
gerous trend in government:
"I am not going to argue le-
galisms, for they do not go
to the center of the issue.
The real issue is whether the
President, through declara-
tion or implication or by ap-
peasement or hy acquies-
cence, or by joint statements
with foreign officials, can
commit the American peo-
ple to foreign nations with-
out the specific consent of
the elected representatives
of the people.
"There has been a grievous
list of such commitments.
They include international
agreements which shackle
our economy by limiting a
free market. But more ter-
rible were such executive
agreements as our recogni-
tion of Soviet Russia . . .
our tacit alliance with So-
viet Russia . . . our acqui-
escence in the annexation by
Russia of the Baltic States
at Moscow and the partition
of Poland at Teheran . . .
the appeasement and sur-
render at Yalta of 10 nations
to slavery
"The actions of unre-
strained Presidential freedom
resulted in a shrinking of
human freedom over the
whole world. We must make
such misuses of power for-
ever impossible."
Implied in all this is the
answer to those like Truman
who complain about the en-
croachments of Congress. For
Congress certainly cannot be
charged with the disastrous
acts which have placed upon
us the burden of a mad arma-
ment race and the danger of
a catastrophic war.
Basic in the Hoover philos-
ophy are two warnings which
he has stated before, but nev-
er so forcibly as in this
speech. The first is the peril
involved in the corruption of
the constitutional safeguards
of free men, not through the
direct attacks of Communism
but through the seductive ap-
peal of Socialism masked as
welfare and planning. The
second is the delusion
"offered us by fuzzy-minded
people . . . that imaginary
creature, the common man
the imperative need of
this nation at all times is the
leadership of the uncommon
men and women."
We should not forget that
the uncommon man who said
this is a Quaker. Some years
ago, Hoover's good friend,
David Hinshaw, wrote a re-
markable book making clear
that the fortitude of Hoover
in the face of disappointment
and defeat, his indifference
to the pomp and perquisites
of high office, his scorn of
dubious means to even good
ends, his unflagging industry,
in short, what Hoover calls
"a sound philosophy and a
stout heart" come from his
Quaker faith. But Hinshaw
himself a Quaker added
that fortunately Hoover has
escaped the dour lack of
humor so common in people
of that faith.
Two speeches of Hoover's
will, I hope, live in the annals
of his country.
The first I was fortunate in
hearing at his last appearance
before the Gridiron Club, af-
ter his defeat for re-election.
There was no rancor in what
he said, nor was there the
whimper of frustrated hope.
Instead, there was gratitude
for what his country had
given this poor boy who be-
came President of the United
States.
There was also a stern
warning to those who were
to succeed him against weak-
ening the supports of the
Constitution or enfeebling the
fiber of the people with
fatuous promises and policies.
The second is this speech at
the milestone of fourscore. It
is the distilled essence of
many years of thought and
the ripe fruit of incompar-
able experience.
