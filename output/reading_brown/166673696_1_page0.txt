SACRAMENTO — I have
two newspaper clippings, one
of which I found in an Oregon
paper and the other in a
California paper in the course
of a trip I have taken down
the coast from the Northwest.
The first is an account of
an interview given by Adlai
Stevenson on Saturday, July
3, in Portland. The second is
an account of a speech that
he made at a Democratic rally
in Eugene on July 10.
There are stories in the
newspapers about him between
those dates, well illustrated by
Adlai fishing, sitting, crossing
streams on logs, and in other
positions indicating something
less than a serious exercise in
mastering the problems of
state.
★
In fact, his one quip in the
interview was: "To the victor
belongs the toll." This was
supposed to mean that it has
been Eisenhower who has
been working since November,
1952.
There are some who would
be captious enough to question
this inference concerning the
victor. But there can be little
doubt about the easy life of
the loser — especially after an
examination of the two
clippings to which I have
referred.
In his interview on July 3,
Stevenson said that he intended
to take advantage of his visit
to Oregon "to learn something
about both sides of the power
question."
He gave assurance that he
would learn enough before his
speech six days later to offer
some important conclusions
for the guidance of the country
and his party, and for the
winner of the 1952 elections
who has been struggling with
the matter ever since.

Presumably, Stevenson's
instructor in the promised
seminar was Richard L. Neuber-
ger, who is candidate for the
seat now held by Sen. Cordon.
Of course, Neuberger is
committed to one side of the
question, but that apparently
would make him the ideal
instructor in this instance.
And so, on July 10, Stevenson
drew his conclusions. They
were a denunciation of the
President's power policies. Five
days of fishing, sitting, and
crossing streams on logs
convinced him that the
Eisenhower administration was
moving "with menacing
swiftness against our traditional
and time-tested program of
public resources conservation."
Our policies, he said, amount
to "a drastic change in what
has been virtually a bipartisan
natural resources policy for
almost half a century."
★
I believe that no one who
has seriously studied the
question of private vs. public
power will deny that it involves
as complex a series of problems
as anything that faces the
country.
I have struggled with the
details for a good many years,
in the course of which I have
repeatedly visited the West and
talked with a great many
people about the question.
There are involved many
sciences. There are engineering,
accounting, chemistry, law,
and others. Unfortunately, one
of the ingredients is the so-
called science of politics, and
therefore reason and common
sense have long since been
absent from political discussion
of the subject.
It is ridiculous to say, as
Stevenson said, that there has
been a bipartisan policy on
natural resources for 50 years.
Fifty-two, not 50 years ago,
Theodore Roosevelt secured the
passage of the famous
Reclamation Act. And for the
remainder of his life, in
speeches, articles and books, he
claimed political credit for
himself and, at times, for his
party.
★
Hoover, who as an engineer
knows more about this problem
than any other public figure in
our time, worked out in his
biggest project, at Hoover Dam,
an excellent partnership plan.
Hoover himself immediately
pointed out that Stevenson in
three specific instances grossly
misstated the facts concerning
the Hoover policies. It would
have required only a scanning
of the record to have avoided
this injustice. The fact is that
Hoover, in a speech in 1926 in
Seattle, foreshadowed the whole
idea of basin development.
T. R.'s Democratic cousin,
F. D. R., went along with
George Norris and Harold Ickes
far toward the socialization of
all power.
Now Eisenhower is trying to
restore some local responsibility
and an equitable carrying of
the burden. This problem
cannot be solved by slogans or
wisecracks. That salient fact
Adlai failed to learn on his
vacation.
