RAYMOND MOLEY:
The Various Solutions
in School Integration
It may be taken for
granted that the Attorney
General, Gov. Faubus and
some others on both sides
are concerned only with
the election and possibly
the election after that.
There are, however,
thoughtful people who
have a broader and much
more fundamental concern
about what is to be the
ultimate answer to the
problem so violently ex-
posed in Little Rock.
It is quite apparent that
with such determination
and preparation for the
maintenance of segregated
schools as prevail in a
State like South Carolina,
and with only such token
integration as prevails in
North Carolina, and with
such a mixture as prevails
in Arkansas, a long time
will pass before a single
pattern will emerge.
In many of the southern
school districts the tre-
mendous majority of Ne-
groes means that the
schools will remain all-
Negro. White families
there will either move
elsewhere, send their chil-
dren-to other districts, or
set up small private
schools of their own.
*
In other districts and in
some border States where
the overwhelming majori-
ty is white, the problem is
not serious because inte-
gration will have to be
more or less token. In
those cases the white chil-
dren will accept the Negro
children, who will get on
as well as is possible, de-
spite the great disparity in
the relative standards of
attainment that exist be-
tween the races.
The problem is intensi-
fied where the proportion
of Negro children is up-
ward of 20%. It may well
be that in such cases, after
courts have ordered inte-
gration, and where, as in
South Carolina, public
schools cannot be abol-
ished, white parents will
in some organized manner
build and operate nonpub-
lic schools of their own.
This would mean paying
for two school systems-
one by taxation, and the
other by voluntary con-
tributions. This is not im-
possible, as is abundantly
shown in the maintenance
of parochial schools by
Roman Catholics and oth-
ers.
There is also the possi-
bility that the Federal
government will, despite
what seems to be clear
constitutional and prac-
tical obstacles, overwhelm
opposition with Federal
money. If, as was envi-
sioned in the school bill
that almost passed the
House last year, and with
some changes in the plan,
the Federal government
should go into the busi-
ness of building schools in
the South, they would cer-
tainly be integrated. Then
there would be two dis-
tinctly different systems
---one segregated and sup-
ported by the State; the
other integrated and Fed-
eral.
Perhaps in the long run
the Federal system would
survive and the State's
would, under court orders,
be compelled to go out of
the school business en-
tirely. Then there would
be only white schools, sup-
ported by private funds,
and the Federal system.

A thoughtful South
Carolinian told me last
week of a situation which
he regarded as possible in
some parts of the South-
especially in places where
the level of living stand-
ards is low and where a
great majority of both
races are in relative pov-
erty.
He said that the white
people who could afford it
would build and operate
private schools for their
children, while other
white people would keep
their children at home for
a time and permit Negro
children to take full pos-
session of the public
schools.
Ultimately, he said, par-
ents would grow weary of
having children around
and would accept integra-
tion as inevitable. Then
there would be more and
more commingling of the
less economically for-
tunate white people with
the Negroes, and in the
long run a hybrid popula-
tion would develop such
as exists in some parts of
Latin America, with a
pure white minority main-
tained by superior eco-
nomic strength.
In any event, we are
witnessing a critical era in
a long process of evolu-
tion, the end of which is
clouded in conjecture.
