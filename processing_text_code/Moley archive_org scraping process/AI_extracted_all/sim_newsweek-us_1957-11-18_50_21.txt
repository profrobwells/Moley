# Harvest of Folly
by Raymond Moley

The election last week should be a bitterly painful reminder to the Administration of its past political sins and the necessity of some agonizing reappraisal of its strategy. Otherwise 1958 will be disastrous.

One thing is certain. The wounds from which the Republican cause is suffering are self-inflicted ones. Never was a party offered a greater opportunity for leadership than when, with a popular general as President, it came to Washington in 1952. A nation, suffering from long collective erosion could not resist the lure of sound, sane conservative government.

For the moment there was hope. Professional politicians were set to work putting governmental pieces together. A generally decent, conservative government began to emerge.

But after the death of Taft there began to assert itself the endemic affliction which has plagued the Republican Party for forty years. There was infiltration from Republican ranks of people who were rather than Democrats. The diversity from sound Republican principles were many.

Then the Administration repudiated many of its conservative rank and file and set out to move and more swiftly and more swiftly in what they called "forward." A word from Sherman Adams set it to work disastrously.

A most unfortunate manifestation of Republican centrification was the reaction of many to prospective Republican. This could not favor with a public culturised to romantic appeals. But it revealed to the voters that the President spoke for moderation and it deeply offended regular Republicans who had been muttering 24 months about him and his works. Moreover, it provided a hunting it new for serialists in and around the President. I do not mean the stalwart Republicans. Some of those were Dewey people still fighting the old wars. Most of them, like Rep. Hallison, had the effrontery to suggest that their ideas concerning moderatism were also in the President's mind.

SOMETHING FOR NOTHING

Finally, after the precaution election of a party gathering at the work of a "Republican" Chief Justice, there was open talk about building a solid vote in the North at the expense of unsettling the growing Republican strength in the South. The most eloquent was the Attorney General. The Rev. Clayton Powell presided over one of the many rallies to get to vote in the heart of Harlem. Upon the Administration in 1956 bestowed a favor equal in kind to those received by King Saud and, in return, he came for the President.

The question is how to explain a margin deficit of a few more than a thousand votes. Much the same is true of Negro voters elsewhere in New York and Chicago.

Meanwhile, the precarious margin of two Republican Congressmen is threatened. The situation has probably been lost and the balance of established a real Republican opposition in the state has been in other places in the South where Republican has been growing.

To take a cynical view of the case, which I believe is justified because clearly they did not win the favor they received in criticism, the sin of these Administration strategists surrounds the basic element of Republican public policy. They have committed the politician's ultimate and most grievous sin. They have given away and given something for nothing.
